Artificial intelligence (AI) models struggle to reach performance levels due to the complex nature of Arabic grammar and diverse regional dialects. This study investigated how generative AI (GenAI) functions as a teaching assistant in Arabic language classrooms. Using qualitative methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 instructors; the data was then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results revealed that instructors used GenAI to create material, assess students’ work, and create personalized learning plans. Instructors struggled, however, with AI accuracy in dialect processing, cultural authenticity, and ensuring accurate assessment methods. The analysis raised significant gaps in teacher training, assessment strategies, and institutional guidelines. Instructors found it challenging to evaluate AI-generated Arabic content across different dialects and maintain academic integrity in student assignments. This study recommends developing instructor training, specifically on using GenAI tools for Arabic dialect variations and creating culturally appropriate Arabic language learning materials.},

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as promising agents due to their glucose-lowering, weight-reducing, and cardiorenal protective effects. Accumulating evidence supports their efficacy in improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and potentially enhancing graft and patient survival across diverse transplant populations. Notably, GLP-1RAs exhibit a favorable safety profile, with minimal risk of drug interactions or rejection. Early data also suggest immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits. Moreover, newer dual and triple incretin agonists offer enhanced metabolic efficacy, potentially extending these benefits further. While long-term outcomes remain under investigation, GLP-1RAs represent a compelling therapeutic option that may reshape metabolic management paradigms in both pre- and post-transplant care.},

The most prominent finding is that 74 % of participants expressed mixed or negative sentiments towards AI adoption, citing concerns about job security and data privacy, despite recognizing productivity and automation benefits. In addition, 42 % observed positive shifts in corporate values linked to AI adoption, and strong consensus emerged regarding AI's usefulness in Planning (86 %), Monitoring and Controlling (75 %), and Integration (83 %) project management process groups. While some statistically significant associations were identified, such as employer type (consultant vs. non-consultant) influencing AI use during the project execution phase, these findings are preliminary due to the small sample size. The results highlight the importance of balancing AI-driven efficiencies with ethical safeguards, human oversight, and targeted training.

    abstract = {Improving therapeutic efficacy of newly developed drugs remains a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Spray drying based on atomization using high pressure or supercritical CO2 has been shown to be effective in improving therapeutic efficiency of drugs by forming smaller particles, owing to the distinct solvation power and enhanced mixing potential of supercritical CO2. Several parameters contribute to the critical quality attributes of the final atomized pharmaceutical products resulting from CO2-assisted atomization including high-pressure nozzle design, drying chamber geometry, and operating pressures and temperatures. In this context, the work is focused on a detailed analysis of supercritical CO2 through micro-orifices used in a spray drying enhanced atomization process. We present a computational fluid dynamics model, developed using Ansys FLUENT, to describe the flow of pure, pressurized CO2 through a micro-orifice undergoing trans-critical expansion. After establishing grid independence, the computational model was validated by comparing model predictions to measured mass flow rates and temperature distribution of the cooling effect of CO2 free jet over an adiabatic surface. For supercritical inlet conditions and a nozzle orifice size of 80 µm, experimental results matched predictions reasonably well. The simulated results demonstrated the occurrence of shock waves, a prerequisite for fine droplets formation. Simulated results were critically analyzed to develop new insights into intricate fluid dynamics of flow of CO2 through atomization orifices and an attempt is made to evolve specific guidelines. The presented model and results will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in understanding and optimizing CO2-assisted spray atomization processes.},

    abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly and consistently becoming more integrated in various aspects of our lives. One of the areas where these systems are increasingly used is education. In fact, it is both being incorporated into specific curricula, allowing students the possibility to acquire skills within this field, and more recently AI has been used as a tool to facilitate the teaching and learning process. However, an increased demand and availability of these tools do not imply a successful switch from traditional to AI-supported learning. In this work, ChatGMP, a chatbot leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) able to conduct an interview exercise in a Master's Degree course taught at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is introduced. The exercise consists in a student interview of a fictitious company, represented by the teachers or ChatGMP, regarding its Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). The aim is for the students to ask sensible and well-reasoned questions to acquire the necessary documentation to make an exhaustive report indicating whether the company is a potential fit for business. To evaluate the initiative, we compare the performance of ChatGMP to the one of the physical teachers of the course, as well as the perception of the students towards it. The results show no significant difference in the information provided by the teachers and the model, enabling the students to achieve similar learning. The students that interacted with ChatGMP are satisfied with the initiative and would likely recommend future students to perform the audit with the digital tool. This initial experiment and its positive results lay the foundation for opening the discussion on how to use LLMs in education, the opportunities they could provide, as well as their limitations and drawbacks.},

    abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 (CG4) are proving to be valuable tools in the medical field, not only in facilitating administrative tasks, but in augmenting medical decision-making. LLMs have previously been tested for diagnostic accuracy with expert-generated questions and standardized test data. Among those studies, CG4 consistently outperformed alternative LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5 (now no longer publicly available for use) and Google Bard (now known as “Google Gemini”). The next logical step was to begin to explore CG4’s accuracy within a specific clinical domain. Our study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CG4 within an inpatient neurology consultation service.
Methods
We conducted a review of all patients listed on the daily neurology consultation roster at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, CA, for all days surveyed until we reached a total of 51 patients, ensuring a complete and representative sample of the patient population. ChatGPT-4, using HIPAA-compliant methodology, received patient data from the Epic EHR as input and was asked to provide an initial differential diagnoses list, investigations and recommended actions, a final diagnosis, and a treatment plan for each patient. A comprehensiveness scale (an ordinal scale between 0 and 3) was then used to rate match accuracy between consultant and CG4 initial diagnoses and the consultants’ final diagnoses. In this proof-of-concept study, we assumed that the neurology consultants’ final diagnoses were accurate. We employed a non-parametric bootstrap resampling method to create 95 % confidence intervals around mean scores, a Fisher’s Exact test, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and ordinal logistic regression models to compare the performance between consultant and CG4 groups.
Findings
Our study found that CG4 demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of consultant neurologists. The most frequent comprehensiveness score achieved by both groups was "3," with consultant neurologists achieving this score 43 times and CG4 achieving it 31 times. The mean comprehensiveness scores were 2.75 (95 % CI: 2.49–2.90) for the consultant group and 2.57 (95 % CI: 2.31–2.67) for the CG4 group. The success rate for comprehensive diagnoses (a score of "2″ or "3″) was 94.1 % (95 % CI: 84.1%–98.0 %) for consultants and 96.1 % (95 % CI: 86.8%–98.9 %) for CG4, with no statistically significant difference in success rates (p = 1.00). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test indicated that the consultant group had a higher likelihood of providing more comprehensive diagnoses (W = 1583, p = 0.02). Ordinal logistic regression models identified significant predictors of diagnostic accuracy, with the consultant diagnosis group showing an odds ratio of 3.68 (CI 95 %: 1.28–10.55) for higher value outcomes. Notably, integrating CG4’s initial diagnoses with those from consultants could achieve comprehensive diagnostics in all cases, indicating a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17 to attain one additional comprehensive diagnosis.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that CG4 can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool within the domain of inpatient neurology, providing comprehensive and accurate initial diagnoses comparable to those of consultant neurologists. The use of CG4 might contribute to better patient outcomes by serving as an aid in diagnosis and treatment recommendations, potentially leading to reduced missed diagnoses and quicker diagnostic processes. Continuous strategies and evaluations to improve LLMs' accuracy remain crucial. Further studies with larger sample sizes and independent third-party evaluations are recommended to confirm these findings and assess the impact of LLMs on patient health.},

    abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FENa (Fractional excretion of sodium), FEK (fractional excretion of potassium) and uSID (urinary strong ion difference) in predicting pAKI in sepsis and septic shock.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
Two intensive care units in Argentina.
Patients
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and AKI, and had a urinary biochemistry within 24h of the AKI diagnosis.
Interventions
None.
Main variables of interest
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FENa, FEK and uSID through a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis.
Results
80 patients were included. 40 patients presented pAKI. pAKI group had higher APACHE, SOFA score, and mortality rate. In the ROC curve analysis, uSID had no diagnostic utility (AUC=0.52, p=0.69). FENa presented moderate accuracy showing an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60−0.83; p=0.001), while FEK presented low accuracy with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57−0.80; p=0.04). The optimal Youden point for identifying pAKI was at a FENa higher than 0.51 % with a specificity of 72.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%. In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.

    abstract = {Objective
To compare pharmacy student scores to scores of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated results of three common platforms on pharmacy skills laboratory assignments.
Methods
Pharmacy skills laboratory course assignments were completed by four fourth-year pharmacy student investigators with three free AI platforms: ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini. Assignments evaluated were calculations, patient case vignettes, in-depth patient cases, drug information questions, and a reflection activity. Course coordinators graded the AI-generated submissions. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize AI scores and compare averages to recent pharmacy student cohorts. Interrater reliability for the four student investigators completing the assignments was assessed.
Results
Fourteen skills laboratory assignments were completed utilizing three different AI platforms (ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini) by four fourth-year student investigators (n = 168 AI-generated submissions). Copilot was unable to complete 12; therefore, 156 AI-generated submissions were graded by the faculty course coordinators for accuracy and scored from 0 to 100 %. Pharmacy student cohort scores were higher than the average AI scores for all of the skills laboratory assignments except for two in-depth patient cases completed with ChatGPT. Conclusion. Pharmacy students on average performed better on most skills laboratory assignments than three commonly used artificial intelligence platforms. Teaching students the strengths and weaknesses of utilizing AI in the classroom is essential.},

The literature review includes 44 articles published in prominent accounting education journals, including the Journal of Accounting Education, Accounting Horizons, and Issues in Accounting Education. These articles were qualitatively analyzed to identify the PSAIS mentioned and their alignment with STEM principles. The PSAIS were then validated by academic and professional experts. The analyses revealed that PSAIS include advanced technological skills, such as knowledge of specialised software, data analysis, big data, and artificial intelligence. In addition, a solid understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts is considered crucial for interpreting and analyzing accounting information. The development of PSAIS is therefore key to characterizing accounting as a STEM discipline. These skills, which integrate scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical dimensions, enable accounting professionals to meet the challenges of the digital age and technological advances. Our work contributions include an overview and research agenda, proposing a comprehensive analytic framework that categorizes accounting skills into STEM areas to guide future research and provide practical implications.},

    abstract = {The TrollLabs Open dataset includes comprehensive information that offers a comparison of design practices and outcomes between human participants and Generative AI during a hackathon event. The dataset was curated through the running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2nd among six teams. To the authors' knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations for improved integration in the design process.},

The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data used in the method are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.},

    abstract = {This paper takes the occasion of French DJ David Guetta's use of generative AI tools to create lyrics and a voice in the style of Eminem, which he then used in one of his concerts, as the basis for an exploration of the shifting meaning of creativity and originality in the age of generative AI. Our main contention is that the Guetta form of creativity with generative AI tools differs in certain important respects from what has come before. The paper describes an iterative, dynamic process of conception, prompting, generation, refining, and deployment to characterise creativity in this context. Nevertheless, we contend that copyright – specifically the concept of originality as articulated in US federal law – is a sufficiently durable legal mechanism that can manage these new cultural forms, and that the two basic requirements of modern copyright law (a tangible medium of expression and a modest degree of creativity) remain relevant in identifying the scope of legal protection. The paper argues that the David Guetta story reveals something more general about creativity in a digital age, namely that while hybrid-networked (i.e., human – corporate – machine) creators have always created hybrid-networked cultural forms (i.e., creations that blend human and technology-constituted elements), such hybridity becomes increasingly visible and complex in the context of a new world of generative AI. At the very least, earlier – and influential – models of creativity as human-driven involving creation ex nihilo become harder to sustain in a new age of generative AI. But this does not mean copyright or notions of originality are redundant or that copyright law cannot accommodate Guetta and other cases. Such an account seems important as it challenges the hegemonic and reductive view that AI “generates” artistic works autonomously and avoids reducing the copyright issues raised by such creative works to the related but distinct question of whether learning models rely on copyrighted data. As such, copyright law should remain an important mechanism to facilitate genuine creators who are using AI systems in innovative and unique ways to push the boundaries of their creativity.},

@article{HARTVIGSEN2024,
    abstract = {Background
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to provide early COVID-19 treatment for people at high risk of severe illness and to limit the spread of infection in society. Proper upper respiratory specimen collection is the most critical step in the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in public settings, and throat swabs were the preferred specimens used for mass testing in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is still a discussion about whether throat swabs have a high enough sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, as previous studies have reported a large variability in the sensitivity from 52% to 100%. Many previous studies exploring the diagnostic accuracy of throat swabs lack a detailed description of the sampling technique, which makes it difficult to compare the different diagnostic accuracy results. Some studies perform a throat swab by only collecting specimens from the posterior oropharyngeal wall, while others also include a swab of the palatine tonsils for SARS-CoV-2 testing. However, studies suggest that the palatine tonsils could have a tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2 that may improve the SARS-CoV-2 detection during sampling. This may explain the variation of sensitivity reported, but no clinical studies have yet explored the differences in sensitivity and patient discomfort whether the palatine tonsils are included during the throat swab or not.
Objective
The objective of this study is to examine the sensitivity and patient discomfort of a throat swab including the palatine tonsils compared to only swabbing the posterior oropharyngeal wall in molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
We will conduct a randomized controlled study to compare the molecular detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by a throat swab performed from the posterior oropharyngeal wall and the palatine tonsils (intervention group) or the posterior oropharyngeal wall only (control group). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. All participants fill out a baseline questionnaire upon enrollment in the trial, examining their reason for being tested, symptoms, and previous tonsillectomy. A follow-up questionnaire will be sent to participants to explore the development of symptoms after testing.
Results
A total of 2315 participants were enrolled in this study between November 10, 2022, and December 22, 2022. The results from the follow-up questionnaire are expected to be completed at the beginning of 2024.
Conclusions
This randomized clinical trial will provide us with information about whether throat swabs including specimens from the palatine tonsils will improve the diagnostic sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection. These results can, therefore, be used to improve future testing recommendations and provide additional information about tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2.

We present the system architecture, sequence diagrams, and algorithms, along with the implementation and testing details. We conduct cost, security, and response time analyses to evaluate the smart contracts and LLM performance and compare our solution with existing approaches. We discuss practical implications, as well as challenges and limitations of the proposed solution. Finally, we explore the generalization of our system for various applications.

This study therefore develops a RAHGV (relative-to-absolute hybrid generative valuation) framework for regional land valuation, which combines a hybrid learning strategy with deep generative modeling to produce high-resolution, spatially continuous land value distribution across extensive urban areas. In a case study of New York City (NYC), the RAHGV model outperforms typical one-step models by differentiating between local land variations and broader regional tendencies. Its bi-attention bottleneck significantly improves model performance, reducing MAE (Mean Absolute Error) by 45.75% and MSE (Mean Squared Error) by 69.86% compared to conventional deep generative methods. Local physical infrastructure and mixed land-use patterns primarily influence micro-scale land values, while community amenities and economic vibrancy drive macro-scale values. The findings highlight the potential of the RAHGV framework as a powerful tool for promoting sustainable urban development by delivering high-resolution, data-driven insights that support informed decision-making in rapidly evolving urban environments.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Literature examining the impact of obesity on burn injury remains mixed. Previous examination of the National Burn Repository, now the BCQP, in obesity-related burn research is limited. The aim of this work was to provide an assessment of the BCQP dataset to examine the effect of obesity on burn-related outcomes.
Materials and Methods
A retrospective review of the BCQP dataset from 2015–2018 was conducted. The primary outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcomes included overall length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and total hospital costs. Patients were grouped as obese or non-obese and were further stratified by total body surface area burned (TBSA) for comparison purposes. Multiple logistic regression (MLG) was used to compare the effect of several independent variables on mortality, ICU LOS > 7days, hospital LOS > 10 days, and total hospital costs > $200,000.
Results
Of 41,031 patients in the analysis, 3845 (9.37 %) were obese. Obese patients had a higher mean TBSA (p = 0.01), longer overall LOS (p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), and total hospital costs (p < 0.001). MLG found obesity to be an independent predictor of ICU LOS > 7 days, hospital LOS > 10 days, and total hospital costs > $200,000. Obesity was not an independent predictor of mortality in burn patients, even when stratified by burn size.
Conclusions
The presence of obesity in this dataset was not found to be a predictor of mortality for any burn size, but was a predictor of overall LOS, ICU LOS, and total hospital costs. Including obesity-related variables in databases may improve analysis in obesity-related burn research.},

    abstract = {Deep fakes have been consistently perceived as a threat to social and political processes, particularly elections. A rarely discussed phenomenon, though gaining importance considering the increasing number of real-life use cases, is using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. By manipulating visualizations, artificial intelligence (AI) allows politicians to eliminate or minimize the deficits of their performance and highlight or create features perceived as attractive by the audience. Such manipulations pose a significant epistemic problem, and can severely distort perception of real politicians and their characteristics. These disruptions might correspond to the classic “Ship of Theseus” paradox that addresses the problem of changing identity. The aim of this study is to analyze how this philosophical conundrum could be used for crafting better transparency obligations (disclaimers) for using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. The aim of such disclaimers is to sensitize and protect public opinion against manipulation. However, at the moment the basic labels concentrate on technological dimension of manipulation, overlooking cognitive consequences for human audiences. This paper proposes extensive disclaimers to strengthen their informative and sensitizing potential.},

    abstract = {Lipid nanocarrier (NC)-mediated delivery of antibiotics (including liposomes, cubosomes and hexosomes) is a promising strategy in dealing with the global issue of antimicrobial resistance and has been shown to improve the efficacy of currently available antibiotics. However, our understanding of the effect of lipid nanostructure on interactions of NCs with bacteria is lacking. Herein, we investigate the interactions of four different lipid NCs (including both cubosomes and hexosomes) with a simple bacterial supported lipid bilayer (SLB) mimicking the lipid bilayer of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a combination of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF-M), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Addition of the fusogenic lipid di-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) increased interactions with the SLB, while addition of the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) significantly increased interactions. The QCM-D data and SR-SAXS data indicate that mixing of the particles with E. coli mimicking model layers results in significant disruption to the cubosome structure, while hexosomes remain essentially structurally intact. We propose that the interaction mechanism with bacterial membranes differs among lipid NCs; while cubosomes primarily fuse with the lipid bilayer resulting in a loss of internal nanostructure, hexosomes interact with bacterial membranes via a different mechanism which allows them to retain structural integrity.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT

As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth—namely that highly hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and cell envelope morphology (hops are not equally effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre- and post-assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.},

    abstract = {Background and purpose
Avoiding unnecessary radiotherapy (RT) in patients with limited life expectancy requires accurate selection. Traditional survival models based on structured data often lack precision. Large language models (LLMs) offer a novel approach to structuring unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, potentially improving survival predictions by integrating comprehensive clinical information.
Materials and methods
We analyzed structured and unstructured data from 34,276 RT-treated patients at Yonsei Cancer Center. An open-source LLM structured unstructured EHR data using single-shot learning. External validation included 852 patients from Yongin Severance Hospital. We compared the LLM’s performance against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models using statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches incorporated both structured and LLM-structured data.
Results
The open-source LLM structured unstructured EHR data with 87.5 % accuracy, outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM (35.8 %). Larger LLMs were more effective in structuring clinically relevant features, such as general condition and disease extent, which correlated with survival. Incorporating LLM-structured features improved the deep learning model’s C-index from 0.737 to 0.820 (internal validation) and from 0.779 to 0.842 (external validation). Risk stratification was also enhanced, with clearer differentiation among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups (p < 0.001). Additionally, models became more interpretable, as key LLM-structured features aligned with statistically significant predictors traditionally identified from structured data.
Conclusion
General-domain LLMs, despite not being fine-tuned for medical data, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHRs, significantly improving survival prediction accuracy and model interpretability. The RT-Surv framework highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance clinical decision-making and optimize RT treatment.},

Adopting a cross-national perspective, this study examines how disease-related factors—namely, disease threat and stigma—influence both individuals' intentions to seek health information via generative AI and their preferences for AI compared to traditional interpersonal sources like doctors and peers. In a preregistered 2x2 online experiment, participants from Austria, Denmark, France, and Serbia (Ntotal = 1951) encountered written scenarios about their health that manipulated disease threat (low vs. high) and stigma (low vs. high). The sample was stratified to ensure representativeness for age, gender, and educational level across the countries studied. Results showed no main effect of disease threat on AI information-seeking intentions, but stigma significantly influenced preferences, particularly in mild health conditions. Participants were more likely to consult AI over peers for stigmatized conditions, highlighting the role of AI's anonymous interface in reducing social judgment. Country differences further revealed that national contexts also shape AI adoption: while participants in Denmark and France showed a stronger preference for AI over peers, those in Serbia and Austria preferred peers over AI. Additionally, AI trust and literacy emerged as the strongest predictors of both AI usage intentions and preferences. These findings indicate that gen AI tools can play a complementary role in the health information ecosystem, particularly for stigmatized conditions and in contexts where traditional sources are perceived as less accessible or judgment-free.},

Utilizing generative artificial intelligence, we have developed a framework to swiftly evaluate the γ' solvus temperature and tailor Ni-based superalloys, accelerating the process of discovering Ni-based superalloys. Physics-informed artificial neural network emerged as the optimal choice for reverse engineering, outperforming other models with an R2 score of 0.917 and a mean absolute error of 15 K. In the reverse design process, 20,000 virtual alloy samples were generated based on divide-and-conquer variational autoencoder which divides the dataset into distinct clusters by K-means algorithm provides a structured representation of the alloy composition space, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of its inherent complexities. In a specific alloy design example, 563 samples were identified through screening based on criteria like γ' solvus temperature, composition deviation index, price, and density. Thermodynamic calculations were used to further screen Ni-based superalloys with exceptional high-temperature properties. The showcase of BA alloy discovery through generative artificial intelligence demonstrates the potential of our research to steer the creation of novel compositions for Ni-based superalloys with outstanding high-temperature properties.},

    abstract = {Background: Neuromyths are widespread among educators, which raises concerns about misconceptions regarding the (neural) principles underlying learning in the educator population. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, educators are increasingly relying on these for lesson planning and professional development. Therefore, if LLMs correctly identify neuromyths, they may help to dispute related misconceptions. Method: We evaluated whether LLMs can correctly identify neuromyths and whether they may hint educators to neuromyths in applied contexts when users ask questions comprising related misconceptions. Additionally, we examined whether explicitly prompting LLMs to base their answer on scientific evidence or to correct unsupported assumptions would decrease errors in identifying neuromyths. Results: LLMs outperformed humans in identifying neuromyth statements as used in previous studies. However, when presented with applied user-like questions comprising misconceptions, they struggled to highlight or dispute these. Interestingly, explicitly asking LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions increased the likelihood that misconceptions were flagged considerably, while prompting the models to rely on scientific evidence had only little effects. Conclusion: While LLMs outperformed humans at identifying isolated neuromyth statements, they struggled to hint users towards the same misconception when they were included in more applied user-like questions—presumably due to LLMs’ tendency toward sycophantic responses. This limitation suggests that, despite their potential, LLMs are not yet a reliable safeguard against the spread of neuromyths in educational settings. However, when users explicitly prompt LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions—an approach that may initially seem counterintuitive–this effectively reduced sycophantic responses.},

    abstract = {Introduction and objectives
The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia remains debated, and data from Mediterranean populations are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between AF and dementia in a large Catalan cohort, with a particular focus on identifying subgroups with the strongest associations.
Methods
We conducted a population-based observational study including individuals aged ≥45 years without prior diagnosis of dementia. Data were obtained from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care, which covers more than 80% of the Catalan population. Dementia was identified using ICD-10-CM codes and prescription records. Early-onset dementia (EOD) was defined as diagnosis before age 65 years. Participants were followed up from 2009 to 2021. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of incident dementia.
Results
A total of 2 520 839 individuals were included (mean follow-up: 13 years), of whom 79820 (3.25%) had AF at baseline. On univariate analysis, AF was a strong predictor of dementia (HR, 3.39; P<.001). However, after multivariable adjustment, the association was modest (HR, 1.04; P<.001). AF was a stronger independent predictor in individuals aged <70 years (HR, 1.21; P<.001), whereas the association was not significant in those aged ≥70. The strongest association was observed for EOD (HR, 1.36; P<.001). All associations remained consistent in analyses restricted to individuals without prior stroke.
Conclusions
In a large Mediterranean cohort, AF was independently associated with a modest increase in dementia risk, regardless of stroke. This association was stronger in younger individuals and in EOD. These findings highlight the need for studies assessing the impact of early identification and management of AF on dementia incidence in younger populations.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La relación entre fibrilación auricular (FA) y demencia es controvertida y hay datos limitados en la población mediterránea. Se evaluó la asociación entre FA y demencia en Cataluña, intentando identificar subgrupos de mayor riesgo.
Métodos
Estudio observacional poblacional que incluyó a individuos ≥45 años sin demencia. Los datos se obtuvieron del Sistema de Información para el Desarrollo de la Investigación en Atención Primaria, que cubre más del 80% de la población catalana. La demencia se identificó mediante códigos CIE-10-MC y datos de prescripción farmacológica. Se definió como demencia de inicio temprano (DIT) aquella diagnosticada antes de los 65 años. El seguimiento fue desde 2009 hasta 2021. Los predictores de demencia se evaluaron mediante modelos de regresión de Cox.
Resultados
Se incluyó a 2.520.839 participantes (seguimiento medio de 13 años); 79.820 (3,25%) tenían FA basalmente. La FA fue predictor univariante de demencia (HR=3,39; p<0,001), pero el análisis multivariante reveló una asociación modesta (HR=1,04; p<0,001). La FA fue un predictor independiente más potente en <70 años (HR=1,21; p<0,001) y la asociación fue máxima en DIT (HR=1,36; p<0,001). En cambio, la asociación FA-demencia perdió significación en ≥70 años. Los resultados fueron similares censurando por ictus.
Conclusiones
En una gran cohorte mediterránea, la FA se asoció de forma independiente con un aumento moderado del riesgo de demencia, independientemente del ictus. Esta asociación fue más fuerte en individuos más jóvenes y en DIT. Estos hallazgos subrayan la necesidad de realizar estudios que evalúen el impacto de la identificación y el tratamiento precoz de la FA en la incidencia de la demencia en pacientes jóvenes.},

    abstract = {Background
Despite research linking chemical and physical restraints to negative outcomes including unplanned intubations and psychological distress, there is little guidance for their use in the care of trauma patients. We used institutional data to describe recent trends in chemical and physical restraint in the emergency department evaluation and treatment of trauma patients and to identify characteristics associated with their use.
Methods
This study includes adult trauma activations at a United States urban level I trauma center from January 2016 to July 2022. Data were collected from the trauma registry and medical record. We assessed the use of chemical restraints and physical restraints during care provided in the trauma resuscitation bay and emergency department. We assessed trends over time graphically and with logistic regression. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations between restraint use and patient and clinical characteristics and the outcomes of ICU admission, hospitalization duration, and mortality.
Results
Of the 8,112 patients, most were male (74.8 %), White (55.8 %), and privately insured (35.2 %). Overall, 8.1 % were restrained with 7.1 % chemically restrained and 2.7 % physically restrained. Overall restraint use increased 254 % (p < 0.001) from 2016 to 2022 driven primarily by a 460 % (p < 0.001) increase in chemical restraint use including a 630 % increase in ketamine administrations (p < 0.001). Use of restraints was associated with pre-existing psychotic disorders, intoxication, altered mental status, increasing injury severity, and Medicaid insurance (p < 0.001). Chemical restraint administration was associated with a 3.5 percentage point (95 %CI 1.1–5.9; p = 0.004) increase in the probability of ICU admission and a 1.0 day (95 %CI 0.6–1.4; p < 0.001) increase in hospitalization duration.
Conclusions
In this institutional study, nearly one-in-twelve trauma patients were restrained during emergency department evaluation and treatment. Restraint utilization increased during the study driven primarily by increases in ketamine and restraints utilized during trauma bay evaluation and resuscitation. Future research should assess the generalizability of these findings. It is important that rigorous guidelines are established to ensure the safe and effective use of restraints in trauma.},

    abstract = {Future 6G communications are envisioned to enable a large catalogue of pioneering applications. These will range from networked Cyber-Physical Systems to edge computing devices, establishing real-time feedback control loops critical for managing Industry 5.0 deployments, digital agriculture systems, and essential infrastructures. The provision of extensive machine-type communications through 6G will render many of these innovative systems autonomous and unsupervised. While full automation will enhance industrial efficiency significantly, it concurrently introduces new cyber risks and vulnerabilities. In particular, unattended systems are highly susceptible to trust issues: malicious nodes and false information can be easily introduced into control loops. Additionally, Denial-of-Service attacks can be executed by inundating the network with valueless noise. Current anomaly detection schemes require the entire transformation of the control software to integrate new steps and can only mitigate anomalies that conform to predefined mathematical models. Solutions based on an exhaustive data collection to detect anomalies are precise but extremely slow. Standard models, with their limited understanding of mobile networks, can achieve precision rates no higher than 75%. Therefore, more general and transversal protection mechanisms are needed to detect malicious behaviors transparently. This paper introduces a probabilistic trust model and control algorithm designed to address this gap. The model determines the probability of any node to be trustworthy. Communication channels are pruned for those nodes whose probability is below a given threshold. The trust control algorithm comprises three primary phases, which feed the model with three different probabilities, which are weighted and combined. Initially, anomalous nodes are identified using Gaussian mixture models and clustering technologies. Next, traffic patterns are studied using digital Bessel functions and the functional scalar product. Finally, the information coherence and content are analyzed. The noise content and abnormal information sequences are detected using a Volterra filter and a bank of Finite Impulse Response filters. An experimental validation based on simulation tools and environments was carried out. Results show the proposed solution can successfully detect up to 92% of malicious data injection attacks.},

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has increased faster in low- and middle-income countries. We determined how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the relationship between income level and prevalence of DM, disease management, and the use of primary care services.
Methods
Descriptive cross-sectional study. It included diabetic patients over 14 years of age residing in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria as of 31 December 2022. The results were compared with those of a pre-pandemic study in 2019.
Results
The prevalence of DM in 2022 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was almost identical to that of 2019, with a slight decrease in the low- and high-income groups, and an increase in the middle-income group. The average age of the population with DM increased. The average number of visits to the doctor increased, while visits to the nursing home decreased. A worsening of glycosylated hemoglobin and low-density lipoproteins was found in high and middle incomes. The trend was the opposite for body weight, with a 1.2% increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity in low incomes.
Conclusions
Lower incomes were associated with worse outcomes in terms of overweight and obesity. The situation of people with DM with overweight or obesity worsened compared to 2019 for the lower-income population.

La prevalencia de DM en 2022 en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria fue casi idéntica a la de 2019, con un ligero descenso en los grupos de rentas bajas y altas, y un aumento en el grupo de rentas medias. La edad media de la población con DM aumentó. El número medio de visitas al médico aumentó, mientras que las visitas a enfermería disminuyeron. Se encontró un empeoramiento de la glucohemoglobina y las lipoproteínas de baja densidad en los ingresos altos y medios. La tendencia fue la opuesta para el peso corporal, con un aumento del 1,2% en la prevalencia de sobrepeso/obesidad en los ingresos bajos.
Conclusiones
Los ingresos más bajos se asociaron a peores resultados en materia de sobrepeso y obesidad. La situación de las personas con DM con sobrepeso u obesidad empeoró en comparación con 2019 para la población de menores ingresos.},

Purpose
To examine the effectiveness of evaluating widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for detecting glaucoma progression compared with conventional circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFLT) measurements.
Design
Longitudinal study.
Participants
One-hundred and fifty-six eyes with glaucoma from 115 participants.
Methods
This study included individuals seen over ≥2 visits that were 12 months apart, and who were also scheduled for retest visits within ≤1 month at the baseline and 12-month visits. A circumpapillary circle scan on spectral-domain OCT and a widefield 15×15 mm OCT volume scan was acquired from each eye at each visit. A total of 286 and 284 unique visit pairs were thus available where OCT scans were obtained 12 months and ≤1 month apart respectively, serving as the case and control groups respectively. Widefield OCT scans from these visit pairs were evaluated by two graders, who assessed the ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and thickness difference maps for glaucoma progression, masked to the time difference between the two scans.
Main Outcome Measures
Percentage of eyes deemed as progressing at 95% specificity.
Results
Evaluation of widefield OCT scans identified >2 times as many eyes as progressing over a 12-month period (Grader 1 = 36.7%, Grader 2 = 38.1%) than cpRNFLT measurements from spectral-domain OCT (16.8%; P<0.001 for both) at 95% specificity. For the subset of 96 (62%) eyes with a baseline visual field mean deviation (MD) ≥-6 dB, evaluation of widefield OCT scans identified ≥3 times as many eyes as progressing (Grader 1= 41.1, Grader 2 = 46.3%) compared to cpRNFLT measurements (13.6%; P<0.001 for both). There was substantial between-grader agreement for the eyes identified as progressing on widefield OCT imaging (Gwet’s first-order coefficient [AC1] = 0.76). Evaluation of widefield OCT scans in a two-arm trial seeking to detect a ≥30% treatment effect in one study eye with 80% power was estimated to reduce sample size requirements by 69% compared to cpRNFLT measurements, or by 80% when only including eyes with an MD ≥-6 dB.
Conclusions
Qualitative evaluation of widefield OCT scans showed an enhanced detection rate for structural progression than cpRNFLT measurements in glaucoma eyes.},

Data sources included screen capture and video observations, design interviews, pre- and post- surveys, and multimodal products. Through qualitative and multimodal analysis, four main themes emerged for understanding preservice teachers’ multimodal composing processes: (1) composing was an iterative process of prompting guided by the AI tools, (2) composers exhibited two distinct processes when designing their projects, (3) AI shaped creative possibilities, and (4) play, humor, and surprise served a key function while composing.

    abstract = {Background
Despite potential risks, artificial intelligence–based chatbots that simulate psychotherapy are becoming more widely available and frequently used by the general public. A comprehensive way of evaluating the quality of these chatbots is needed.
Objective
To address this need, we developed the CAPE (Conversational Agent for Psychotherapy Evaluation) framework to aid clinicians, researchers, and lay users in assessing psychotherapy chatbot quality. We use the framework to evaluate and compare the quality of popular artificial intelligence psychotherapy chatbots on the OpenAI GPT store.
Methods
We identified 4 popular chatbots on OpenAI’s GPT store. Two reviewers independently applied the CAPE framework to these chatbots, using 2 fictional personas to simulate interactions. The modular framework has 8 sections, each yielding an independent quality subscore between 0 and 1. We used t tests and nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests to examine pairwise differences in quality subscores between chatbots.
Results
Chatbots consistently scored highly on the sections of background information (subscores=0.83-1), conversational capabilities (subscores=0.83-1), therapeutic alliance, and boundaries (subscores=0.75-1), and accessibility (subscores=0.8-0.95). Scores were low for the therapeutic orientation (subscores=0) and monitoring and risk evaluation sections (subscores=0.67-0.75). Information on training data and knowledge base sections was not transparent (subscores=0). Except for the privacy and harm section (mean 0.017, SD 0.00; t3=∞; P<.001), there were no differences in subscores between the chatbots.
Conclusions
The CAPE framework offers a robust and reliable method for assessing the quality of psychotherapy chatbots, enabling users to make informed choices based on their specific needs and preferences. Our evaluation revealed that while the popular chatbots on OpenAI’s GPT store were effective at developing rapport and were easily accessible, they failed to address essential safety and privacy functions adequately.},

    abstract = {Clinical diagnostics is the process of identifying diseases or medical conditions in patients through various tests, including laboratory analyses, imaging, and genetic testing. It helps guide treatment, monitor disease progression, and evaluate overall health. Accurate diagnostics are crucial for early detection, personalized medicine, and improving patient outcomes. Bioinformatics plays a significant role in clinical diagnostics by analyzing vast amounts of biological data, especially genetic information. Bioinformatics tools can help interpret genomic sequences, identify disease-associated mutations, and uncover biomarkers for specific conditions. This accelerates diagnosis, allows for personalized treatments, and supports research into novel diagnostics, ultimately making healthcare more precise and efficient. Bioinformatics tools for image analysis have hastened the analysis of pathological images and scans, providing accurate diagnosis. This chapter provides an overview of the latest bioinformatics developments in clinical diagnostics.},

    abstract = {Over the past three decades, standardizing organizations (e.g., the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Internet Engineering Task Force) have investigated the efficiency of cryptographic algorithms and provided (technical) guidelines for practitioners. For example, the (Datagram) Transport Layer Security “(D)TLS” 1.2/1.3 was designed to help industries implement and integrate such methods through underpinning infrastructures of Internet of Everything (IoE) environments with efficiency and efficacy in mind. The main goal underpinning such protocols is to protect the Internet connections between IoE machines from malicious activities such as unauthorized eavesdropping, monitoring, and tampering with messages. In theory, these protocols are supposed to be secure. Still, most existing implementations partially follow the standard features of (D)TLS 1.2/3, leaving them vulnerable to risks such as side-channel and network attacks. In this paper, we critically review the standard protocols deployed for the security management of data and connected machines, and also examine the recently discovered vulnerabilities that lead to successful zero-day attacks in IoE environments. Then, we discuss various potential countermeasures in the form of organizational policy enforcement strategies and mitigation approaches that can be used by cybersecurity practitioners, decision- and policy-makers. Finally, we identify both proactive and reactive solutions for further consideration and study, as well as propose alternative mechanisms and e-governance policies for standardizing organizations and engineers in future solution designs.},

    abstract = {In multimodal writing, students can mobilize both linguistic and non-linguistic resources to express their real or imagined identities. But at the same time, when students are limited to choosing from available online resources, their voices might be compromised due to the incompatibility between their authorial intentions and the materials available to them. This study, therefore, investigates whether the use of generative AI tools could help student authors construct a more consistent voice in multimodal writing. In this study, we have designed a photo essay assignment where students recount a story in the form of photo essays and prompt AI image-generating tools to create photos for their storytelling. Drawing on interview data, written reflections, written annotations, and multimodal products from seven focal participants, we have identified two remixing practices–layering and blending–through which students attempted to establish a coherent and unique voice in writing. The study sheds light on the intentional and discursive nature of multimodal writing with AI as afforded by the technological flexibility, while also highlighting the practical and ethical challenges that could be attributed to students’ insufficient prompt and multimodal literacy and the innate limitations of AI systems. This study provides important implications for incorporating AI tools in designing multimodal writing tasks.},

    abstract = {Acute kidney injury is associated with not only high morbidity in the acute phase but also the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recently, we found that suppression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) exhibits renoprotective effects in acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study investigated the hypothesis that temporal suppression of SPARC in the early stages of I/R-injury might lead to the prevention of renal injury in the chronic phase. The left renal pedicle of male BALB/c mice was occluded for 45 min after right uninephrectomy and subsequently reperfused for 28 days. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting SPARC was injected intravenously 1 day before and 3 days after I/R. Histological assessment revealed that SPARC knockdown by siRNA attenuated tubular injury, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and the overexpression of 4-hydroxynonenal, a marker of lipid peroxidation. I/R-induced overexpression of a major source of superoxide NADPH oxidase, tumor necrosis factor-α, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was suppressed by siRNA targeting SPARC. Treatment with siRNA targeting SPARC reduced the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADAMTS1), which colocalizes with SPARC. In conclusion, SPARC might be a potential therapeutic target for preventing CKD development following acute I/R injury.},

This study examines the impact of global supply chain pressure on Chinese business and consumer confidence from February 2000 to September 2024. It employs Quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression, which helps to understand how varying levels of global supply chain pressure influence different levels of Chinese business and consumer confidence, providing insights beyond what can be gauged via a mean-based regression. The main results show the following: Firstly, Chinese business confidence is negatively associated with supply chain pressure across all upper, middle, and lower quantiles, reflecting a homogenous adverse impact irrespective of the levels of both variables. Secondly, Chinese consumer confidence is impacted heterogeneously by the magnitude of supply chain pressure, indicating the relevance of the quantile distribution of both variables to their association. The results remain valid after applying a Wavelet Quantile Correlation approach, indicating their robustness. Our findings offer crucial insights to Chinese policymakers and other stakeholders, suggesting that Chinese businesses do not tolerate pressure in the global supply chain, whereas Chinese consumers tend to switch to local products and services during lapses in the global supply chain.},

At the same time, compared with traditional real social objects, chatbots may show better emotional identification with objects. The structural equation modeling is a path analysis method based on the factor analysis and linear regression, which can be used to analyze the path relationship between intricate variables. Based on the structural equation modeling, this paper analyzes the potential pathways for artificial intelligence chatbots to induce the user's emotional dependence. The results show that the “sense of identification” and “sense of control” will cause people to have emotional dependence on the artificial intelligence chatbots, with p < 0.05. However, the psychological distance plays a regulating role in the identification-emotional dependence and the sense of control-emotional dependence, respectively. The research results in this paper show that there is a certain theoretical basis for the chatting intelligent robots to transform from a tool role to a social and emotional role.},

Deploying the AIGC model in edge networks unlocks new possibilities. Unfortunately, realizing AIGC in distributed edge networks faces critical challenges, including the interdependent control decisions, the complex trade-offs between energy consumption and total variation (TV) distance, the extension of TV distance due to insufficient denoising steps, the restriction of AIGC inferencing deadlines, and the uncertainty of AIGC task arrivals. In this paper, targeting AIGC tasks, we design polynomial-time online algorithms to overcome all these challenges. Firstly, we formulate distributed AIGC as a non-linear mixed-integer program for long-term total cost optimization. Subsequently, we propose a novel algorithmic approach that generates candidate inferencing schedules, reformulates the original problem into a new schedule selection problem, and solves this new problem using an online primal–dual-based algorithm. Moreover, we rigorously prove that our approach leads to a constant competitive ratio for the long-term total cost. Through extensive evaluations using real-world data, the superior practical performance of our approach is demonstrated, reducing the total cost by more than 50% compared to various alternative methods.},

    abstract = {Background
To date, no direct comparisons have been performed to compare the effectiveness of all epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing osimertinib, lazertinib, aumolertinib, befotertinib, furmonertinib, dacomitinib, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, and chemotherapy. Pooled estimations of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity (grade ≥ 3 adverse events) were performed within the Bayesian framework.
Results
Twenty-three trials involving 11 treatments were included. All EGFR-TKIs improved PFS relative to chemotherapy, except for icotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–1.44). All EGFR-TKIs demonstrated significant ORR benefits over chemotherapy. Osimertinib seemed to prolong PFS compared with icotinib (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1–0.86), gefitinib (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21–0.74), and erlotinib (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29–1.0). In addition, osimertinib showed favorable superiority in improving OS compared with chemotherapy (HR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.43–0.82), gefitinib (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45–0.83), erlotinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48–0.89), and afatinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44–0.94). Among these regimens, afatinib showed the highest ORR (cumulative probability: 96.96%). Icotinib was associated with minimal toxicity among the EGFR-TKIs, followed by furmonertinib and osimertinib. Moreover, the toxicity spectra differed among the EGFR-TKIs. Subgroup analyses of patients with two common types of EGFR mutations indicated that furmonertinib possessed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with exon 19 deletion, and lazertinib showed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with Leu858Arg mutation. We also identified differences between EGFR-TKIs in prolonging PFS in patients with brain metastasis.
Conclusions
Osimertinib is the first choice of treatment with considerable efficacy and safety for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The treatments associated with the best PFS in patients with exon 19 deletions and Leu858Arg mutations were furmonertinib and lazertinib, respectively.},

    abstract = {In sludge dewatering of most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the dose of polymer flocculant is manually adjusted through direct visual inspection of the flocs without the aid of any instruments. Although there is a demand for the development of automatic control of flocculant dosing, this has been challenging owing to the lack of a reliable flocculation sensor. To address this issue, this study developed a novel image sensor for measuring the degree of flocculation (DF) based on deep learning. Two types of sludge samples were used in the laboratory-scale flocculation tests: excess sludge and mixtures of excess sludge and raw wastewater. To search for a deep learning regression model suitable for DF inference, ten models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and a multilayer perceptron MLP mixer, were comparatively analysed. The ConvNeXt and MLP mixer models showed the highest accuracies with coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.9. The region contributing to the DF inference in the flocculation images was visualised using a modulus-weighted, gradient-weighted regression activation map. A prototype of the flocculation sensor was constructed using an inexpensive EdgeAI device. This device comprises a single-board computer and an integrated graphical processing unit (GPU) and is equipped with a quantised ConvNeXt model. The maximum inference speed of the sensor was 12.8 frames per second (FPS). The flocculation control tests showed that the sensor could control the DF to the target value by adjusting the polymer flocculant dose. Therefore, the flocculation sensor can provide a data-driven approach to the management of the flocculation process, thereby facilitating the automation of WWTPs.},

    abstract = {Objectives
To systematically evaluate the performance of COVID-19 prognostic models and scores for mortality risk in older populations across three health-care settings: hospitals, primary care, and nursing homes.
Study Design and Setting
This retrospective external validation study included 14,092 older individuals of ≥70 years of age with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 2020 to December 2020. The six validation cohorts include three hospital-based (CliniCo, COVID-OLD, COVID-PREDICT), two primary care-based (Julius General Practitioners Network/Academisch network huisartsgeneeskunde/Network of Academic general Practitioners, PHARMO), and one nursing home cohort (YSIS) in the Netherlands. Based on a living systematic review of COVID-19 prediction models using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool for quality and risk of bias assessment and considering predictor availability in validation cohorts, we selected six prognostic models predicting mortality risk in adults with COVID-19 infection (GAL-COVID-19 mortality, 4C Mortality Score, National Early Warning Score 2-extended model, Xie model, Wang clinical model, and CURB65 score). All six prognostic models were validated in the hospital cohorts and the GAL-COVID-19 mortality model was validated in all three healthcare settings. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home settings. Model performance was evaluated in each validation cohort separately in terms of discrimination, calibration, and decision curves. An intercept update was performed in models indicating miscalibration followed by predictive performance re-evaluation.
Main Outcome Measure
In-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home setting.
Results
All six prognostic models performed poorly and showed miscalibration in the older population cohorts. In the hospital settings, model performance ranged from calibration-in-the-large −1.45 to 7.46, calibration slopes 0.24–0.81, and C-statistic 0.55–0.71 with 4C Mortality Score performing as the most discriminative and well-calibrated model. Performance across health-care settings was similar for the GAL-COVID-19 model, with a calibration-in-the-large in the range of −2.35 to −0.15 indicating overestimation, calibration slopes of 0.24–0.81 indicating signs of overfitting, and C-statistic of 0.55–0.71.
Conclusion
Our results show that most prognostic models for predicting mortality risk performed poorly in the older population with COVID-19, in each health-care setting: hospital, primary care, and nursing home settings. Insights into factors influencing predictive model performance in the older population are needed for pandemic preparedness and reliable prognostication of health-related outcomes in this demographic.},

    abstract = {Building material reuse can reduce the environmental impact of construction yet its advanced digital support is still limited. Which digital tools could effectively support repair of highly irregular, salvaged materials? To probe this question, a framework featuring six advanced digital tools is proposed and verified through six design and prototyping experiments. The experiments demonstrate that a digital toolkit integrating photogrammetry, robot vision, machine learning, computer vision, computational design, and robotic 3D printing effectively supports repair and recovery of irregular reclaimed materials, enabling their robust digitization, damage detection, and feature-informed computational redesign and refabrication. These findings contribute to the advancement of digitally aided reuse practices in the construction sector, providing valuable insights into accommodating highly heterogeneous reclaimed materials by leveraging advanced automation and digitization. They provide the crucial and currently missing technological and methodological foundation needed to inform future research on industrial digital solutions for reuse.},

    abstract = {Metabolic diseases may be prevented by reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing plant-based diets with animal-based ones low in carbohydrates but high in protein, fat, and iron. While the effects of sugars on metabolic diseases are well-known, the role of iron remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of a high-fat high-iron animal diet on body metabolism in mice. Micro-PET imaging was used to assess 18-F-labelled glucose uptake in BAT, and the morphology, respiratory function, and oxidative stress of BAT mitochondria were examined. The underlying mechanisms were elucidated by analyzing the expression of UCP-1, PGC-1α and PPARα. The high-iron high-fat diet increased appetite, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin sensitivity. Additionally, the high-iron diet promoted gluconeogenesis only in the absence of high-fat levels. Both high-iron and high-fat diets suppressed BAT activity, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial respiratory function, and lowered thermogenic gene expression. Weight loss strategies focusing solely on reducing carbohydrates and increasing animal foods, like ketogenic diets, may have long-term detrimental effects on metabolic health. Prioritizing dietary diversity and monitoring overall caloric intake is advisable for optimal outcomes.},

    abstract = {Feedback seeking is an emerging focus in higher education and writing assessment research. Feedback may be sought directly from others or through observing cues in learning contexts. Existing research suggests feedback seeking may be essential to student feedback literacy, but few studies explore this issue in relation to specific high-need populations. This study examined Chinese international students’ practices and perceptions of feedback seeking in writing assessments during their first years at an Australian university. Thirty-seven participants from three faculties participated in 14 individual interviews and seven focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis protocols. Encountered challenges were grouped into epistemological, ontological, and practical dimensions. Findings indicate that students drew upon various sources for inquiry and monitoring at the stages of planning and preparation, revising before submission, and reacting after getting results. Implications include the importance of creating low-threshold opportunities for facilitating learners’ feedback seeking. Findings also suggest that educators’ enhanced understanding of students' educational identity and epistemological beliefs may improve students’ feedback-seeking practices.},
