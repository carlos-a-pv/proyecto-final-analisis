abstract = {Background
In Spain, the prevalence of heart failure is twice the European average, partly due to inadequate patient management. To address this issue, a standardized care model, the Care Model for Patients with Heart Failure (Modelos Asistenciales de Atención al Paciente con Insuficiencia Cardíaca), was developed. This model emphasizes the importance of sequential visits from hospital discharge until the patient transitions to chronic care to prevent rehospitalization. The standardized care pathway has been implemented in certain areas of the Andalusia Health Service. However, there is uncertainty about whether the region’s electronic health record system, Diraya, can effectively support this model. If not properly integrated, it could lead to data inaccuracies and noncompliance with the standardized care pathway.
Objective
This study aimed to explore how to improve Diraya to better support health care professionals in adhering to the transition standardized care model for patients with heart failure as they move from hospital care to chronic care.
Methods
In total, 16 semistructured interviews were conducted with nurses and physicians from both hospital and primary care settings. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data and recommendations for improvements that were developed based on the findings. These recommendations were further supported by existing literature and validated through additional interviews.
Results
In total, 65 codes, 23 subthemes, and 8 themes were identified. The main themes included optimizing medical data management for enhanced clinical workflow, agreement on standardization and enhancement of the discharge report, enhancing clinical decision support through updated guidelines and automated tools, optimizing interoperability as a solution for better management of patients with heart failure, and encouraging communication based on digital tools and personal connection. In total, 15 improvements were proposed, such as standardizing technology across Andalusia Health Service facilities and offering targeted training programs. These measures aim to enhance interoperability, streamline communication between different health care settings, and reduce the administrative burden for health care professionals.
Conclusions
Diraya currently does not adequately support the transition standardized care model, placing a significant administrative burden on health care professionals, often with ethically concerning implications. To ensure effective implementation of the standardized care model, major updates are necessary for Diraya’s clinical information management, system functionality, and organizational structure within the Andalusia Health Service.}

In response, social media platforms are increasingly considering explicit AI content labeling, though the evidence to support the effectiveness of this approach has been mixed. In this paper, we discuss two studies which shed light on antecedent cognitive processes that help explain why and how AIGC labeling impacts user evaluations in the specific context of AI-generated political images. In the first study, we conducted a neurophysiological experiment with 26 participants using EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) and self-report measures to gain deeper insights into the brain processes associated with the evaluations of artificially generated political images and AIGC labels. In the second study, we embedded some of the stimuli from the EEG study into replica YouTube recommendations and administered them to 276 participants online. The results from the two studies suggest that AI-generated political images are associated with heightened attentional and emotional processing. These responses are linked to perceptions of humanness and trustworthiness. Importantly, trustworthiness perceptions can be impacted by effective AIGC labels. We found effects traceable to the brain’s late-stage executive network activity, as reflected by patterns of the P300 and late positive potential (LPP) components. Our findings suggest that AIGC labeling can be an effective approach for addressing online misinformation when the design is carefully considered. Future research could extend these results by pairing more photorealistic stimuli with ecologically valid social-media tasks and multimodal observation techniques to refine label design and personalize interventions across demographic segments.}

To evaluate the ability of 15 different large language models (LLMs) to solve clinical cases with osteoarticular infections following published guidelines.
Materials and Methods
The study evaluated 15 LLMs across 5 categories of osteoarticular infections: periprosthetic joint infection, diabetic foot infection, native vertebral osteomyelitis, fracture-related infections, and septic arthritis. Models were selected systematically, including general-purpose and medical-specific systems, ensuring robust English support. In total, 126 text-based questions, developed by the authors from published guidelines and validated by experts, assessed diagnostic, management, and treatment strategies. Each model answered individually, with responses classified as correct or incorrect based on guidelines. All tests were conducted between April 17, 2025, and April 28, 2025. Results, presented as percentages of correct answers and aggregated scores, highlight performance trends. Mixed-effects logistic regression with a random question effect was used to quantify how each LLM compared in answering the study questions.
Results
The performance of 15 LLMs was evaluated, with the percentage of correct answers reported. OpenEvidence and Microsoft Copilot achieved the highest score (119/126 [94.4%]), excelling in multiple categories. ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro scored 117 of the 126 (92.8%). When used as references, OpenEvidence was not inferior to any comparator and was superior to 5 LLMs. Performance varied across categories, highlighting the strengths and limitations of individual models.
Conclusion
OpenEvidence and Miccrosoft Copilot achieved the highest accuracy among evaluated LLMs, highlighting their potential for precisely addressing complex clinical cases. This study emphasizes the need for specialized, validated artificial intelligence tools in medical practice. Although promising, current models face limitations in real-world applications, requiring further refinement to support clinical decision making reliably.}

Integrating LLMs into systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers potential solutions to current LLMs’ problems, like the generation of false or misleading information. The objective of this paper is to design and debate the value of an AI-driven system, similar to ChatGPT, to enhance the uptake of clinical guidance within the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK. Conversational interfaces, powered by LLMs, offer healthcare practitioners clear benefits over traditional ways of getting clinical guidance, such as easy navigation through long documents, blending information from various trusted sources, or expediting evidence-based decisions in situ. But, putting these interfaces into practice brings new challenges for HTA bodies, like assuring quality, addressing data privacy concerns, navigating existing resource constraints, or preparing the organization for innovative practices. Rigorous empirical evaluations are necessary to validate their effectiveness in increasing the uptake of clinical guidance among healthcare practitioners. A feasible evaluation strategy is elucidated in this research while its implementation remains as future work.}

abstract = {Background
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in vascular atherosclerosis and are involved in the pathophysiology of CAD. This study aimed to validate the associations of eight exosomal miRNAs with CAD and assess their relevance to disease severity.
Methods
A total of 875 participants who underwent elective coronary angiography were enrolled between January 2022 and August 2023. Blood samples were collected during angiography, and exosomal miRNAs were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Only miRNAs with detection rates above 50% and reproducible results were included. Differential expression was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the Mann–Whitney U test), with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.
Results
Participants in the severe CAD group (with significant three-vessel disease) were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension than those in the non-CAD group (with patent coronary arteries). miRNA-382-3p was significantly upregulated in patients with severe CAD, correlating with the presence of disease. miRNA-3613-3p and miRNA-185-5p exhibited variable expression patterns, warranting further investigation. miRNA-200a-3p expression did not significantly differ between the groups, whereas miRNA-432-5p, miRNA-125a-5p, miRNA-151a-3p, and miRNA-328-3p had low detection rates, limiting their analytical utility.
Conclusions
miRNA-382-3p is associated with severe CAD and may contribute to understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic development. Further studies are necessary to validate its clinical significance and broader application.}

The generative model is used to produce laminate designs that meet the specific design requirements, while their hidden quantitative relation is revealed by the explainable model. The effectiveness of this framework is verified through two classical composite design cases: isotropic and homogeneous laminates. The laminating rules proposed by the data-driven framework are proven to be reasonable and consistent with those in common laminate practices. This work demonstrates the great potential of artificial intelligence not only in guiding laminate design but also in providing new perspectives on discovering composite theory.}

We examined contextual (i.e., autonomy-supportive leadership, autonomy-thwarting leadership), occupational experience (i.e., professional growth striving, change-related stress), and background factors (i.e., gender, age, teaching experience, contract length, class size, school level) as predictors of motivation (i.e., genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities). Among 339 Australian teachers, our findings revealed that perceived autonomy-supportive leadership, professional growth striving, and change-related stress were linked with greater genAI valuing. In turn, genAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in both teaching-related work and student learning activities. Perceived autonomy-thwarting leadership was directly linked with greater genAI integration in student learning activities, and professional growth striving was directly associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work. Teachers’ gender and school level were also linked with the motivation and engagement factors, and there were several indirect associations as well. Our results pinpoint areas of focus for future research, policy, and practice to support genAI and its application in schools.}

Health systems globally are facing huge challenges to deal with the ever-growing numbers of non-communicable diseases (NCD’s), the majority of which are lifestyle associated. In the Irish context, 1.07million people have one or more chronic diseases, 76% of deaths are attributed to chronic disease and there is a 4% increase in chronic disease each year (Healthy Ireland Survey 2015: Summary of findings, 2021).Patients with RA have co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension (Pranata et al 2020). Lifestyle choices such as smoking have been shown to reduce treatment response (Aimer et al 2020). Cornelissen et al (2021) exploring what matters to patients with RA when facing medical decisions, patients emphasised the value of healthy lifestyle and keeping up their physical fitness.
Objectives:
To produce an evidence based booklet to support the patient and the clinician to incorporate lifestyle medicine into rheumatology clinical care.
Methods:
Funding was secured via a nursing bursary award. The project lead, brought together a team of seven experts including nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics, substance misuse, health coaching and patients. The group collaborated with a design expert to conceptualize the booklet, key messages, tone and brand. Each healthcare professional created content for each lifestyle pillar according to their expertise. Patient feedback informed change through the process.
Results:
The booklet facilities lifestyle changes with a range of tools to activate patient participation to identify and address small changes in each pillar and their relationship with arthritis. Bridges self-management tools and language is a theme through all six pillars offering person centred techniques to facilitate and guide individual behaviour change meaningful to each patient.
Conclusion:
Lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on health and arthritis. By using the principles of lifestyle medicine patients have the potential to adapt and sustain positive lifestyle changes and live their best life with arthritis.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is commonly linked to liver fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis. FIB-4, APRI, and NFS are used to predict fibrosis severity, but their accuracy and role in long-term outcomes remain unclear.
Objectives
This study evaluates the predictive value of these scores for fibrosis and assesses the incidence of de novo cirrhosis and survival outcomes in MASLD patients.
Methods
This retrospective, single-center study included 175 MASLD patients in our university medical center. The diagnostic performance of FIB-4, APRI, and NFS for advanced fibrosis (stage 3–4) was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate factors associated with de novo cirrhosis and survival outcomes.
Results
The mean age was 49.9±14.1 years, and 54.9% were female. The median follow-up was 78 months. ROC analysis showed FIB-4 (AUC: 0.77) was the best predictor of advanced fibrosis, followed by APRI (AUC: 0.74) and NFS (AUC: 0.74). Multivariate analysis identified fibrosis stage (HR: 3.045, p=0.001) and hypertension (HR: 4.096, p=0.047) as independent predictors of de novo cirrhosis. Age (HR: 1.070, p=0.031), albumin (HR: 15.151, p<0.001), and HbA1c (HR: 1.589, p<0.001) were independently associated with survival.
Conclusion
FIB-4 was the most accurate predictor of advanced fibrosis. Fibrosis stage and hypertension were the strongest predictors of de novo cirrhosis. These findings highlight the importance of fibrosis staging and comorbidity management in MASLD.}

The committee assigned the following grades: Overall PA, D−; Organized Sports and Physical Activity Participation, C−; Active Play, Incomplete; Active Transportation, D; Sedentary Behavior, D−; Physical Fitness, Incomplete; Family and Peers, D; School, C; Community and Environment, D+; Government, A−.
Conclusions
Chile's 2022 RC, like its previous versions, shows persistently low grades for most indicators. Overall PA remained nearly unchanged, while Community and Environment scored lower. Slight improvements were seen in Organized Sports, Family and Peers, and School Environment. While Chile has endeavored to increase children's activity levels, policies require implementation through a systemic, coherent framework to promote sustainable changes and reach a larger portion of children and youth.}

abstract = {Background
Esophageal cancer (EC) is the seventh most prevalent cancer and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related mortalities worldwide. Camrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated moderate efficacy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Lactobacillus paracasei, a probiotic bacterium, has a complementary effect in immunotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the combination of camrelizumab and L. paracasei for advanced ESCC.
Methods
This single-arm, single-center, exploratory trial was conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. Eligible patients received 200 mg camrelizumab biweekly and two bags of L. paracasei twice daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs).
Results
From May 2020 to October 2022, ten patients with advanced ESCC who did not respond to first-line therapy were admitted. At the data cutoff date (August 9, 2023), the median follow-up duration was 12 months. Two of 10 (20%) achieved objective responses. The median survival was 7.5 months and the median OS was not reached. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred in two of the 10 patients (20%). No serious treatment-related AEs or deaths occurred.
Conclusions
Camrelizumab combined with L. paracasei showed favorable anticancer activity and may be a viable second-line treatment for patients with ESCC.

abstract = {Background
Total hip arthroplasty is the preferred treatment for advanced hip osteoarthritis, yet complications like hip dislocation (0.2 %–10 %) persist due to factors such as implant design, positioning, surgical technique, and patient-specific conditions. Impingement between prosthetic components or the acetabulum and proximal femur is a primary cause of instability.
Methods
A retrospective analysis of 120 patients (130 hips) undergoing total hip arthroplasty at XX Hospital (2011−2023) categorized patients by lateral center-edge angle: developmental dysplasia of the hip, borderline developmental dysplasia of the hip, and normal hip. ct imaging facilitated virtual 3D bone models for motion analysis, excluding cases with prior hip surgery or spinal fusion. Statistical analyses utilized the Mann–Whitney U test and one-way ANOVA.
Findings
The developmental dysplasia of the hip group showed the highest posterior impingement frequency, significantly affecting range of motion in flexion, adduction, and external rotation compared to borderline developmental dysplasia of the hip and normal hip groups. Variations in femoral neck anteversion, lesser trochanter version, and ischiofemoral space were notable. Posterior impingement commonly occurred between the lesser trochanter and ischial tuberosity.
Interpretation
Posterior bony impingement emerged as a predominant factor reducing range of motion and increasing dislocation risk, particularly in developmental dysplasia of the hip patients, challenging the conventional “safe zone” for implant positioning. Personalized surgical strategies tailored to individual bone morphology are crucial for enhancing total hip arthroplasty outcomes and minimizing complications, although limitations include the exclusion of soft tissue influences and focusing solely on range of motion until impingement occurs.}

abstract = {Purpose
To assess the ability of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to generate accurate and relevant responses to the 2022 American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).
Methods
Responses from ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to prompts derived from all 15 AAOS guidelines were evaluated by 7 fellowship-trained orthopaedic sports medicine surgeons using a structured questionnaire assessing 5 key characteristics on a scale from 1 to 5. The prompts were categorized into 3 areas: diagnosis and preoperative management, surgical timing and technique, and rehabilitation and prevention. Statistical analysis included mean scoring, standard deviation, and 2-sided t tests to compare the performance between the 2 large language models (LLMs). Scores were then evaluated for inter-rater reliability (IRR).
Results
Overall, both LLMs performed well with mean scores >4 for the 5 key characteristics. Gemini demonstrated superior performance in overall clarity (4.848 ± 0.36 vs 4.743 ± 0.481, P = .034), but all other characteristics demonstrated nonsignificant differences (P > .05). Gemini also demonstrated superior clarity in the surgical timing and technique (P = .038) as well as the prevention and rehabilitation (P = .044) subcategories. Additionally, Gemini had superior performance completeness scores in the rehabilitation and prevention subcategory (P = .044), but no statistically significant differences were found amongst the other subcategories. The overall IRR was found to be 0.71 (moderate).
Conclusions
Both Gemini and ChatGPT-4 demonstrate an overall good ability to generate accurate and relevant responses to question prompts based on the 2022 AAOS CPG for ACLR. However, Gemini demonstrated superior clarity in multiple domains in addition to superior completeness for questions pertaining to rehabilitation and prevention.
Clinical Relevance
The current study addresses a current gap in the LLM and ACLR literature by comparing the performance of ChatGPT-4 to Gemini, which is growing in popularity with more than 300 million individual uses in May 2024 alone. Moreover, the results demonstrated superior performance of Gemini in both clarity and completeness, which are critical elements of a tool being used by patients for educational purposes. Additionally, the current study uses question prompts based on the AAOS CPG, which may be used as a method of standardization for future investigations on performance of LLM platforms. Thus, the results of this study may be of interest to both the readership of Arthroscopy and patients.}

Although chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is effective in advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its efficacy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations remains unclear.
Methods
This retrospective analysis included 66 patients: 28 received chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, and 38 received chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was safety. In eligible patients with measurable disease, tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. PFS was defined as the time from the first day of therapy to disease progression.or death from any cause.
Results
The median progression–free survival (mPFS) was 10.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.03—16.63 months) in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group and 6.23 months (95% CI: 4.53—7.07 months) in the chemotherapy alone group. There was a significant difference in efficacy between the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy and chemotherapy-alone groups (p < 0.001). Among the 25 patients evaluated for tumor response in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group, 11 (44%) achieved a partial response (PR), 8 (32%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (24%) had progressive disease (PD). The objective response rate (ORR) was 44%. Adverse events (AEs) included gastrointestinal reactions and myelosuppression. There were no significant differences in terms of safety between the two treatment groups.
Conclusions
First-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy was associated with significantly longer PFS than chemotherapy alone in patients with EGFR ex20ins-mutant NSCLC, without increased toxicity.}

abstract = {Background
Falls represent a significant health burden among individuals with diabetes, yet the long-term relationship between diabetes status and fall risk remains inadequately characterized in Asian populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between diabetes status and incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults using nationally representative longitudinal data.
Methods
Utilizing China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2011–2020 data, we included 9553 participants (aged ≥45 years) for a 9-year prospective cohort study. Diabetes was classified as normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or diabetes based on self-reported diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), or HbA1c levels. Incident falls were assessed via self-reports across four survey waves from 2011 to 2020. Multivariable logistic regression models were to evaluate the independent association between diabetes and falls and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were conducted.
Results
The study included 7131 (74.6 %) participants with normal glucose levels, 1254 (13.1 %) with prediabetes, and 1168 (12.2 %) with diabetes. Mean age was 58.1 ± 9.0 years, with 46.9 % males. Fall incidence rates were significantly higher in the diabetes group (55.1 %) compared to prediabetes (48.3 %) and normal glucose groups (47.3 %) (P < 0.001). After full adjustment for potential confounders, diabetes was associated with a 27 % increased risk of incident falls (OR=1.27, 95 % CI: 1.11–1.45, P < 0.001), while prediabetes showed no significant association (OR=0.99, 95 % CI: 0.87–1.12, P = 0.817). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in older adults aged ≥60 years (OR=1.45, 95 % CI: 1.18–1.78) compared to those <60 years (OR=1.17, 95 % CI: 0.98–1.39), with similar effects in both sexes. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings.
Conclusions
Diabetes significantly increases the risk of incident falls among Chinese middle-aged and older adults, with a 27 % higher risk persisting after comprehensive adjustment. This association appears to be specific to established diabetes rather than prediabetes, suggesting a pathophysiological threshold effect. The findings support the integration of fall prevention strategies into routine diabetes care, particularly for older adults, and have important implications for clinical practice guidelines and public health policy in China's rapidly aging population.}

Using a novel data set of real-world and online weld images, annotated by a domain expert, we evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art MLLMs in assessing weld acceptability across three contexts: RV & Marine, Aeronautical, and Farming. While both models perform better on online images, likely due to prior exposure or memorization, they also perform relatively well on unseen, real-world weld images. Additionally, we introduce WeldPrompt, a prompting strategy that combines Chain-of-Thought generation with in-context learning to mitigate hallucinations and improve reasoning. WeldPrompt improves model recall in certain contexts but exhibits inconsistent performance across others. These results underscore the limitations and potentials of MLLMs in high-stakes technical domains and highlight the importance of fine-tuning, domain-specific data, and more sophisticated prompting strategies to improve model reliability.

abstract = {Background
Colistin is a last-resort antibiotic against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae. Reliable susceptibility testing is critical but challenging due to colistin’s complex pharmacodynamics and testing limitations. This study evaluates the performance of the Colistin Agar Test (CAT) against the gold standard Broth Microdilution (BMD) method.
Methods
Study was conducted after confirming stability of colistin in agar plate. A total of 150 non-duplicate clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae (103 colistin intermediate, 47 resistant) were tested using both BMD and CAT. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of these isolates was performed using VITEK-2. Quality control was ensured using CLSI-recommended strains. Statistical parameters including Categorical Agreement (CA), Essential Agreement (EA), Major Error (ME), Very Major Error (VME), sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and Cohen’s Kappa were calculated using BMD as reference.
Results
MICs ranged from 0.125-16 µg/mL (BMD) and 0.125–8 µg/mL (CAT). CA and EA for CAT were 96 % and 87.3 % respectively. ME and VME were 4.8 % and 2.1 %. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of CAT were 97.9 %, 95.1 %, 90.1 %, and 98.9 % respectively. Cohen’s Kappa showed almost perfect agreement (0.91).
Conclusion
CAT demonstrated high agreement with BMD and showed promise as a screening tool for colistin susceptibility in K. pneumoniae. While BMD remains the gold standard, CAT offers a feasible alternative for routine use, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, resistant results by CAT should be confirmed with BMD to avoid false resistance reporting and potential therapeutic exclusion of colistin.}

Radium-223 (Ra-223) treatment is used to extend the overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with bone metastases. However, the optimal timing for its administration remains ambiguous. Hence, this study aimed to determine the optimal timing for Ra-223 administration.
Materials and methods
We retrospectively included Japanese men with mCRPC with bone metastases who were treated with Ra-223. The primary endpoint was OS from Ra-223 treatment. Secondary endpoints included the maximum reduction in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the incidence of adverse events following Ra-223 treatment. The exploratory endpoint was the association between clinical parameters and OS.
Results
Overall, 100 men with mCRPC with bone metastasis treated with Ra-223 wereenrolled. The median OS from the Ra-223 treatment was 38.6 months. Post Ra-223 treatment, ALP, LDH, and PSA levels decreased in 78.6%, 56.1%, and 44.9% of patients, respectively. Grade ≥3 anemia occurred in three (4.1%) patients. The median OS of patients with ≥10 months from diagnosis to developing mCRPC (52.4 months, P < 0.014), a PSA doubling time ≥3 months (52.4 months, P = 0.035), prior docetaxel (DOC) treatment (108.2 months, P = 0.002), five or less numbers of bone metastasis (97.9 months, P = 0.006), five or more cycles of Ra-223 treatment (46.1 months, P = 0.045), hemoglobin measuring ≥13.1 g/dl (52.4 months, P = 0.003), ALP measuring ≤260 (54.8 months, P = 0.003), or LDH measuring ≤220 (46.1 months, P = 0.002) was significantly longer than that of those who had <10 months from diagnosis to developing mCRPC, a PSA doubling time <3 months, absence of prior DOC treatment, more than five bone metastasis, less than four cycles of Ra-223 treatment, hemoglobin measuring <13.1 g/dl, ALP measuring >260, or LDH measuring >220. Multivariate analysis showed that prior DOC administration prolonged the OS.
Conclusions
Ra-223 treatment is safe and effective for mCRPC.}

The themes have been identified on the basis of ongoing developments in AI, existing regulations and industry discussions. Prior to making any new regulatory recommendations we explore whether novel issues can be solved by existing regulations.

abstract = {The human gut microbiome is a complex microbial ecosystem which has a profound impact on host health and disease. The research focus in this area is rapidly moving from taxonomy to functionality, elucidating the biological role of small molecules produced by the gut microbiome in regulating host metabolism. Among these, microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) play several roles in bacterial communication and microbe–host signaling. Volatilomics, the comprehensive study of volatile metabolites, is emerging as a powerful tool for discovering and investigating these interactions. In this review we examine the current understanding of mVOCs in the gut and highlight how dedicated in vitro and ex vivo volatilomics experiments, alongside in vivo studies, can uncover the biological roles for these emerging small molecules.}

abstract = {Background
The objective of this study was to assess the complication and re-operation rates, evaluate the risk of non-union, and describe the functional outcomes at last follow-up in children and adolescents after lower-limb malignant tumour resection and reconstruction using the induced-membrane technique.
Hypothesis
Weight-bearing resumption 6 weeks after the second stage of the induced-membrane procedure promotes bone healing.
Material and methods
The study included 13 patients (9 with osteosarcoma, 3 with Ewing's sarcomas, and 1 with alveolar sarcoma) managed between 2000 and 2020 by oncological femoral or tibial resection followed, at a distance from adjuvant chemotherapy, by reconstruction using the induced-membrane technique. Non-union was the primary outcome measure and the MusculoSkeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) lower-limb functional score was the secondary outcome measure. Mean follow-up was 6.1 years (range, 2.0–12.7). At last follow-up, mean age was 18.1 years (range, 11.0–26.0) and the mean MSTS score was 66.6% (37.0–93.0%).
Results
After the second reconstruction stage, 8 complications developed in 6 patients (46%). Either a complication or limb-length inequality required 12 re-operations in 8 patients (61.5%). Non-union occurred after reconstruction in 5 (38.5%) patients. Early resumption of 50% weight-bearing 6 weeks after reconstruction was associated with bone healing (p=0.02).
Conclusion
The non-union rate was 38.5%. Partial, 50% weight-bearing with two elbow crutches and an orthosis, if allowed by construct stability, may promote bone healing.

The diffusion depth and distribution of the diffusion source are critical metrics for evaluating the efficiency of the diffusion process. Glow discharge mass spectrometry can sequentially strip layers of the magnet within a limited region to measure the concentration of the diffusion source at various depths. However, the accuracy is compromised by the multiphase nature of the base magnet material and the inhomogeneous distribution of the diffusion source. In contrast, electron probe microanalysis enables direct observation of the diffusion depth and distribution by analyzing diffusion cross-sections of the magnet. Coupled with digital image processing techniques, electron probe microanalysis allows high-throughput analysis of images to calculate concentration across depth intervals, establish depth-concentration relationships, and predict the concentration of heavy rare-earth elements at specific depths. Describing the distribution of diffusion sources presents a significant challenge. In this work, a probabilistic denoising diffusion model is proposed for the first time to quantify the distribution of the diffusion source. EPMA images were segmented into 3,700 distinct positions for model training. The trained model can generate diffusion images with the same distribution of heavy rare-earth elements at any position. By training on microscopic images of various magnets, the model establishes a profound correlation between magnet performance and microstructure, providing practical guidance for optimizing magnets or diffusion sources.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) is frequent, worsens prognosis and increases healthcare resources use and costs. This research aims to quantify the impacts of HF as a concomitant diagnosis with COPD.
Methods
Retrospective, observational study of consecutive patients aged 40 years or older who visited the emergency department (ED) during 2018 for COPD exacerbation. One-year clinical outcomes, resource utilization and costs were compared between those with and without HF, using the Clinical Outcomes, HEalthcare REsource utilizatioN, and relaTed costs (COHERENT) model.
Results
Among 2,384 COPD patients, mean age was 75.7 years, 40.1% women. Of these 35.1% had concomitant diagnosis of HF. Patients with COPD and HF exhibited higher 1-year rates of mortality (31.2 % vs 19.2%, p<0.001), hospitalization (95.6% vs 78.9%, p<0.001), readmission and return to ED. Adjusted for age, sex and comorbidity, HF was an independent predictor of mortality (HR, 1.25; 95%CI, 1.03-1.50; p=0.02). Also, HF coexistence was independently associated with a 42% excess in mean 1-year healthcare cost (ratio of means, 1.42; 95%CI, 1.24-1.63; p<0.001), adjusted for age and comorbidities.
Conclusions
The concomitant diagnosis of HF in patients with COPD exacerbation is associated with increased 1-year risk of all outcomes, increased use of healthcare resources and almost a doubling in total costs. Specific multidisciplinary strategies targeting these patients may be needed to improve their outcomes and reduce costs.}

Recent advancements in multimodal AI have shown the potential to solve such complex tasks. This research uses ChatGPT, a type of multimodal AI, to validate the recognition performance of weather map images and proposes prompt engineering for more accurate recognition. Weather map recognition is a problem that is also featured in the Common University Entrance Test. If weather maps can be recognized, automatic grading and question generation become possible, leading to learning support. Furthermore, it is expected that weather commentary text can be automatically generated from weather maps. Therefore, weather map image recognition is an important task, but it requires not only recognizing time-series changes in local weather data but also recognizing information on large-scale weather patterns such as pressure pattern and making future predictions. In this research, we use ChatGPT4-Vision, a multimodal AI, to validate the recognition performance of weather map images. We investigate whether it can answer questions about weather maps from university entrance exams and generate weather commentary text from weather map images. By conducting multiple experiments with varying tasks and information in the prompts, and evaluating the accuracy of the generated commentaries, we propose and validate improvements in reading performance through prompt engineering.}

abstract = {Background
In 2017, Burgel and colleagues developed an algorithm to identify clinical phenotypes that predict mortality in COPD. Our study aimed to 1) investigate whether the phenotypes can predict acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and 2) validate their ability to predict mortality.
Methods
The Tools Identifying Exacerbations (TIE) cohort study recruited participants with spirometry-verified COPD from primary and secondary care in three Swedish regions. Participants were allocated to phenotypes 1–5 using the previously developed algorithm containing comorbidities (heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and/or diabetes), dyspnoea, age, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and body mass index (BMI). Data on AECOPDs and deaths during the three-year follow-up were collected from medical records and analysed with Cox proportional hazards regressions. Harrel's C-index was used to assess the models' discriminative ability.
Results
Among the 566 participants, 59 % were female, and the mean ± SD FEV1 was 57 ± 18 % of predicted. The hazard ratios (HRs) [95 % CI] for time to AECOPD were 3.04 [1.93–4.79], 2.38 [1.54–3.66], and 3.52 [1.73–7.15] in phenotypes 1, 2, and 4 compared with 5 (C-index = 0.61). When AECOPD history was used to predict future AECOPD the C-index was 0.65. The HRs [95 % CI] for mortality were 8.24 [1.93–35.3], 6.26 [1.40–28.0], and 16.7 [3.25–86.3] in phenotypes 1, 3, and 4 compared to 5 (C-index = 0.68). For AECOPD history, the C-index was 0.55.
Conclusion
Clinical COPD phenotypes based on comorbidities, dyspnoea, age, FEV1, and BMI predict AECOPDs but do not perform better than AECOPD history. However, they perform better than AECOPD history in predicting mortality.}

Rural community patients with acute stroke fhave worse outcomes compared to those in urban communities. This study determined the associations between agency type (rural, suburban, urban), patient care (compliance with American Heart Association [AHA] guidelines), and patient outcomes (discharge disposition).
Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of patients with prehospital impression of suspected stroke and a final diagnosis of an acute stroke or TIA between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022. Prehospital agencies were classified by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) score: urban (RUCA 1), suburban (RUCA 2-3), rural (RUCA 4-10). Descriptive statistics characterized the cohort. Multivariable regression analysis tested the association between agency type and discharge disposition while controlling for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, initial NIHSS, in-hospital intervention, and receiving facility type.
Results
Urban-, suburban-, and rural-based agencies varied in compliance with the AHA recommendations. Rural agencies had the lowest proportion of encounters with full compliance (2.0 %) compared to suburban (7.0 %) and urban agencies (11.0 %) (p < 0.01). Compared to patients transported by urban agencies, patients transported by suburban agencies had almost twice (1.78 times; 95 % CI, 1.19-2.65) the odds of discharge to hospice or death and 0.56 times (95 % CI, 0.38-0.84) the odds of discharge home after controlling for covariates.
Conclusions
Rural EMS agencies had the lowest proportion of full compliance with AHA prehospital stroke guidelines. Acute stroke patients transported by suburban EMS agencies were less likely to be discharged home and more likely to be discharged to death compared to patients transported by urban-based EMS agencies.}

abstract = {Background
Online accessible patient education materials (PEMs) are essential for patient empowerment. However, studies have shown that these materials often exceed the recommended sixth-grade reading level, making them difficult for many patients to understand. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to simplify PEMs into more readable educational content.
Objective
We sought to evaluate whether 3 LLMs (ChatGPT [OpenAI], Gemini [Google], and Claude [Anthropic PBC]) can optimize the readability of PEMs to the recommended reading level without compromising accuracy.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used 60 randomly selected PEMs available online from 3 websites. We prompted LLMs to simplify the reading level of online PEMs. The primary outcome was the readability of the original online PEMs compared with the LLM-simplified versions. Readability scores were calculated using 4 validated indices Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook Index. Accuracy and understandability were also assessed as balancing measures, with understandability measured using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool-Understandability (PEMAT-U).
Results
The original readability scores for the American Heart Association (AHA), American Cancer Society (ACS), and American Stroke Association (ASA) websites were above the recommended sixth-grade level, with mean grade level scores of 10.7,10.0, and 9.6, respectively. After optimization by the LLMs, readability scores significantly improved across all 3 websites when compared with the original text. Compared with the original website, Wilcoxon signed rank test showed ChatGPT improved the readability to 7.6 from 10.1 (P<.001); Gemini, to 6.6 (P<.001); and Claude, to 5.6 (P<.001). Word counts were significantly reduced by all LLMs, with a decrease from a mean range of 410.9-953.9 words to a mean range of 201.9-248.1 words. None of the ChatGPT LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate, while 3.3% of Gemini and Claude LLM-simplified PEMs were inaccurate. Baseline understandability scores, as measured by PEMAT-U, were preserved across all LLM-simplified versions.
Conclusions
This cross-sectional study demonstrates that LLMs have the potential to significantly enhance the readability of online PEMs while maintaining accuracy and understandability, making them more accessible to a broader audience. However, variability in model performance and demonstrated inaccuracies underscore the need for human review of LLM output. Further study is needed to explore advanced LLM techniques and models trained for medical content.}

abstract = {Background
Several studies have highlighted the synergistic effects of immunotherapy and radiotherapy on local and abscopal tumor control. However, data regarding the use of first-line immunochemotherapy (ICT) combined with radiotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are scarce. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line immunochemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (ICRT) and those of ICT alone.
Methods
Patients with advanced NSCLC who received first-line anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy plus chemotherapy at Wuhan Union Hospital and Hunan Cancer Hospital between October 2017 and July 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety associated with treatment were assessed. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Results
A total of 194 patients were included: 92 were treated with ICRT and 102 were treated with ICT. The ORRs of the ICRT and ICT groups were 57.6% and 47.1%, respectively. Patients in the ICRT group had significantly longer PFS (median: 14.9 vs. 11.5 months; P = 0.035) and OS (median: 41.3 vs. 23.1 months; P = 0.047) than those of patients in the ICT group. Patients treated with thoracic radiotherapy, those treated with extrathoracic metastasis radiotherapy, and those treated without radiotherapy had median PFS of 21.5 months, 12.9 months, and 11.5 months (P = 0.031); and the median OS were not reached, 41.3 months, and 23.1 months (P = 0.007), respectively. ICRT and ICT were generally well-tolerated, and the overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups. A total of 2.2% (2/92) of patients experienced grade 3 or grade 4 radiation-related adverse events.
Conclusions
Radiotherapy is safe and manageable when added to first-line anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC.}

The bacterial endotoxin test (BET) using the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test was established as an effective method. However, the application of BET employing Carcinoscorpius or Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (CAL/TAL), derived from Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda and Tachypleus gigas, remained rarely performed. This study aimed to explore the CAL and TAL potential for detecting bacterial endotoxins in milk and groundwater. In this assay, 94 blood samples of horseshoe crabs collected from the Banyuasin Waters of South Sumatra (79 samples of C. rotundicauda and 15 samples of T. gigas) were used. The assay was carried out using the gel-clot method. The results revealed that the CAL and TAL were able to detect small concentrations of endotoxin (up to a concentration of 0.0156 EU/mL) in raw milk, pasteurized milk, well water, and L1 HPV 52 protein based on the gel-clot test. Both CAL and TAL could be a potential substitute for the LAL assay, especially for detecting bacterial biomass in milk and groundwater.

abstract = {Background
With the climbing incidence of type 2 diabetes, the health care system is under pressure to manage patients with this condition properly. Particularly, pharmacological therapy constitutes the most fundamental means of controlling blood glucose levels and preventing the progression of complications. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by factors such as treatment complexity, polypharmacy, and poor patient adherence. As new technologies, artificial intelligence and digital technologies are covering all aspects of the medical and health care field, but their application and evaluation in the domain of diabetes research remain limited.
Objective
This study aims to develop and establish a stand-alone diabetes management service system designed to enhance self-management support for patients, as well as to assess its performance with experienced health care professionals.
Methods
Diabetes Universal Medication Schedule (DUMS) system is grounded in official medicine instructions and evidence-based data to establish medication constraints and drug-drug interaction profiles. Individualized medication schedules and self-management programs were generated based on patient-specific conditions and needs, using an app framework to build patient-side contact pathways. The system’s ability to provide medication guidance and health management was assessed by senior health care professionals using a 5-point Likert scale across 3 groups: outputs generated by the system (DUMS group), outputs refined by pharmacists (intervention group), and outputs generated by ChatGPT-4 (GPT-4 group).
Results
We constructed a cloud-based drug information management system loaded with 475 diabetes treatment–related medications; 684 medication constraints; and 12,351 drug-drug interactions and theoretical supports. The generated personalized medication plan and self-management program included recommended dosing times, disease education, dietary considerations, and lifestyle recommendations to help patients with diabetes achieve correct medication use and active disease management. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the DUMS group outperformed the GPT-4 group in medication schedule accuracy and safety, as well as comprehensiveness and richness of the self-management program (P<.001). The intervention group outperformed the DUMS and GPT-4 groups on all indicator scores.
Conclusions
DUMS’s treatment monitoring service can provide reliable self-management support for patients with diabetes. ChatGPT-4, powered by artificial intelligence, can act as a collaborative assistant to health care professionals in clinical contexts, although its performance still requires further training and optimization.}

abstract = {Background/purpose(s)
Staphylococcus aureus overgrowth contributes to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) through biofilm formation, bacterial invasion, and immune evasion. These factors lead to persistent infections and complications, especially in cases of refractory CRS. This study examines baicalein's effects on bacterial virulence and host responses using Calu-3 cells as an in vitro testing platform.
Methods
Baicalein's effects on S. aureus-induced epithelial damage were evaluated in a Calu-3 cell co-culture model. The analyses included bacterial clumping, biofilm formation, internalization, tight junction integrity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and key signaling pathways.
Results
Baicalein inhibited bacterial clumping, biofilm formation, and internalization by downregulating key virulence genes (fnbpA, fnbpB, clfB, rot, sarA, and icaR). It also suppressed the Agr and LuxS/AI-2 quorum sensing systems, which regulate virulence and biofilm development. In host cells, baicalein reduced S. aureus-induced apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/Akt pathway and attenuated oxidative stress and autophagy. Furthermore, it restored epithelial barrier integrity by preserving ZO-1 localization.
Conclusion
Baicalein demonstrates potential as an alternative therapeutic strategy for reducing CRS recurrence and minimizing prolonged antibiotic use by effectively targeting S. aureus virulence and disrupting bacterial communication. This approach offers a promising solution for managing CRS and reducing reliance on antibiotics.}

keywords = {Pediatric thyroid nodules, Diagnostic criteria},
abstract = {Purpose
Thyroid nodules are uncommon in children and adolescents but carry an increased risk of malignancy when present. The Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) is an adult-validated ultrasound-based risk assessment providing a prediction of malignant potential for thyroid nodules, thereby guiding recommendations for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Minimal data exist regarding the applicability of TI-RADS to predict malignancy in pediatric thyroid nodules. This study aims to analyze the performance of TI-RADS for children and adolescents with thyroid nodules, hypothesizing that applying TI-RADS criteria would improve accuracy and reduce the number of recommended FNAB compared to American Thyroid Association (ATA) size criteria alone.
Methods
A multi-institutional retrospective analysis was conducted including patients ≤21 years with a thyroid nodule by sonographic thyroid imaging between 2015 and 2020. TI-RADS scores were assigned at each institution by a pediatric radiologist trained in thyroid imaging and TI-RADS criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy of TI-RADS scoring were compared to existing ATA size-based recommendation for performing a FNAB. Accounting for relative size differences between adults and children, a novel PED TI-RADS category was developed and tested, recommending FNAB for thyroid nodules with a TI-RADS 3 and ≥ 1.5 cm, TI-RADS 4 and ≥ 1.0 cm, and TI-RADS 5 any feasible size.
Results
291 nodules from 260 patients (median age 14.9 years, 78.8% female) were assessed using TI-RADS. Applying adult TI-RADS criteria resulted in recommendation of FNAB for 35.1% of nodules, in contrast to 76.6% recommended by ATA guidelines (p < 0.0001) (Table). Utilizing the adult TI-RADS score ≥3 as an FNAB indicator resulted in 100% sensitivity and 28.5% specificity, with 0 cases of missed malignant nodules on pathology. When novel PED TI-RADS criteria were applied, 88 patients would have been spared an unnecessary FNAB with improved sensitivity and accuracy over ATA criteria.
Conclusions
The application of adult and PED TI-RADS scoring to thyroid nodules in pediatric patients enhances the accuracy of malignancy prediction compared to current American Thyroid Association size criteria alone. The utilization of PED TI-RADS scoring eliminated unnecessary biopsies in many children while not missing a single thyroid malignancy.
Level of Evidence

Myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) and myositis-associated antibodies (MAAs) are assessed in clinical neurology, serving as a non-invasive tool for the differential diagnosis of autoimmune myopathies. However, the presence of MSAs and MAAs in neurological disorders remains uncertain.
Methods
Retrospective analysis was conducted on 878 serum samples from the neurological laboratory of the University Hospital Tübingen, Germany. The EUROLINE Myositis Profil 3 (IgG) Line Blot was used for antibody evaluation (anti-Mi2, -Ku, -PM-Scl100, -PM-Scl75, -Jo1, -SRP, -PL7, -PL12, -EJ, -OJ, and -Ro52). Samples were categorized into 19 disease groups, with consideration for myositis-linked and non-myositis-linked diseases. Then, the distribution of positive findings and the concurrent presence of more than one MAA/MSA were analyzed.
Results
Among 727 included line blots, 84 could be assigned to myositis-linked diseases (thereof 44 positive for MAA/MSA). MAA and MSA taken together were more frequently positive for the main group of myositis-linked disease (52.4 %) compared to the non-myositis-linked group (14.6 %, overall specificity 85.4 %). However, individual antibodies were specific, ranging above 97.5 %. False positive antibody results can also occur in neurological differential diagnoses such as muscle dystrophy or cramp fasciculation syndrome. Furthermore, the concurrent presence of more than one MAA/MSA does not show a significant association with the presence of a myositis-linked disease for antibody-positive samples (p = 0.136).
Discussion
Testing MSA and MAA simultaneously may not be suitable as a primary screening method for myositis-linked diseases in clinical neurological groups. However, MSAs and MAAs may offer valuable diagnostic support, particularly in cases where myositis is strongly considered.}

abstract = {Background
Managing symptoms of chronic pancreatitis (CP) remains a significant challenge. Korean Red ginseng (KRG), a well-known herbal supplement, has shown potential benefits in various health conditions, prompting its investigation in CP patients.
Methods
We conducted a single-arm, prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effect of KRG on quality of life in CP patients exhibiting mild symptoms, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score of 0 or 1. 40 patients were enrolled and assessed at baseline, as well as at 30, 90, and 180 days. The primary outcome was an improvement in CGI scores, with secondary outcomes including changes in Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency Questionnaire (PEI-Q) scores.
Results
A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, and 39 participants were analyzed. Results showed significant improvements in CGI scores at all examined intervals (days 0–30, 0–90, 0–180; p < 0.05). The PEI-Q score also significantly improved from day 0 to day 180 (p < 0.05). Two adverse events (AEs) probably related to KRG were reported, and all AEs were improved with conservative managements.
Conclusion
KRG supplementation significantly improves quality of life in CP patients with mild symptoms. These findings suggest that KRG may be a beneficial adjunct therapy in this patient population. Further research is needed to explore KRG’s pharmacological mechanisms, its use in combination with other treatments, and its effects in patients with more severe symptoms.

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular and are playing an important role in providing accurate clinical information to both patients and physicians. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4.0, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot LLMs for responding to patient questions regarding refractive surgery.
Methods
The LLMs’ responses to 25 questions about refractive surgery, which are frequently asked by patients, were evaluated by two ophthalmologists using a 5-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 to 5. Furthermore, the DISCERN scale was used to assess the reliability of the language models’ responses, whereas the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level indices were used to evaluate readability.
Results
Significant differences were found among all three LLMs in the Likert scores (p = 0.022). Pairwise comparisons revealed that ChatGPT-4.0′s Likert score was significantly higher than that of Microsoft Copilot, while no significant difference was found when compared to Google Gemini (p = 0.005 and p = 0.087, respectively). In terms of reliability, ChatGPT-4.0 stood out, receiving the highest DISCERN scores among the three LLMs. However, in terms of readability, ChatGPT-4.0 received the lowest score.
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4.0′s responses to inquiries regarding refractive surgery were more intricate for patients compared to other language models; however, the information provided was more dependable and accurate.}

abstract = {Background
Rural individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) experience challenges to anticoagulation adherence and self-management of the condition. We tested an intervention to improve anticoagulation adherence, quality of life, and health care utilization in rural individuals with AF.
Methods
We randomized rural patients with AF receiving anticoagulation to receive a smartphone-based relational agent (for disease education and adherence guidance) and a heart rate and rhythm monitor for 4 months or a smartphone-based health education app. Adherence was determined with 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC), and secondary outcomes of quality of life and health care utilization from interviews and health records.
Results
The trial randomized 270 individuals 1:1 (median [IQR] age 73.1 [67.5–78.6]; 163 [60.4 %] female sex). Over the 4-month intervention, intervention participants used the relational agent a median of 101 (IQR: 72, 110) days. In an intention-to-treat analysis there was no significant difference in 12-month PDC between the intervention and control groups (median [IQR]: intervention 0.97 [0.89–1.00] versus control 0.97 [0.92–1.00]) or in PDC ≥0.80. Intervention participants were more likely to self-report anticoagulation adherence than control at 4 and 8 months (95.7 % vs 88.4 % and 93.0 % vs 78.8 %, respectively) but not at 12 months. There were no significant differences by assigned intervention for the other secondary outcomes.
Conclusions
Randomization to the relational agent intervention was not associated with improved PDC at 12-months but with greater interim self-reported adherence compared to a control. This study demonstrates the successful use of a smartphone-based agent to address adherence among rural individuals with AF.}

Case studies have shown ChatGPT can run clinical simulations at the medical student level. However, no data have assessed ChatGPT’s reliability in meeting desired simulation criteria such as medical accuracy, simulation formatting, and robust feedback mechanisms.
Objective
This study aims to quantify ChatGPT’s ability to consistently follow formatting instructions and create simulations for preclinical medical student learners according to principles of medical simulation and multimedia educational technology.
Methods
Using ChatGPT-4 and a prevalidated starting prompt, the authors ran 360 separate simulations of an acute asthma exacerbation. A total of 180 simulations were given correct answers and 180 simulations were given incorrect answers. ChatGPT was evaluated for its ability to adhere to basic simulation parameters (stepwise progression, free response, interactivity), advanced simulation parameters (autonomous conclusion, delayed feedback, comprehensive feedback), and medical accuracy (vignette, treatment updates, feedback). Significance was determined with χ² analyses using 95% CIs for odds ratios.
Results
In total, 100% (n=360) of simulations met basic simulation parameters and were medically accurate. For advanced parameters, 55% (200/360) of all simulations delayed feedback, while the Correct arm (157/180, 87%) delayed feedback was significantly more than the Incorrect arm (43/180, 24%; P<.001). A total of 79% (285/360) of simulations concluded autonomously, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in autonomous conclusion (146/180, 81% and 139/180, 77%; P=.36). Overall, 78% (282/360) of simulations gave comprehensive feedback, and there was no difference between the Correct and Incorrect arms in comprehensive feedback (137/180, 76% and 145/180, 81%; P=.31). ChatGPT-4 was not significantly more likely to conclude simulations autonomously (P=.34) and provide comprehensive feedback (P=.27) when feedback was delayed compared to when feedback was not delayed.
Conclusions
These simulations have the potential to be a reliable educational tool for simple simulations and can be evaluated by a novel 9-part metric. Per this metric, ChatGPT simulations performed perfectly on medical accuracy and basic simulation parameters. It performed well on comprehensive feedback and autonomous conclusion. Delayed feedback depended on the accuracy of user inputs. A simulation meeting one advanced parameter was not more likely to meet all advanced parameters. Further work must be done to ensure consistent performance across a broader range of simulation scenarios.}

abstract = {Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (TULSA) of the prostate uses ultrasound to thermally coagulate tissue under real-time MRI guidance. Real-time feedback from closed-loop MRI thermometry automatically controls treatment parameters to match tissue response in the prescribed ablation volume. The pivotal study of TULSA (“TACT”, NCT02766543), which included a low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) population, has reached the end of the 5-year follow-up duration. Here we report the safety and efficacy outcomes at 5 years
Methods
The TACT study enrolled 115 patients across 13 sites in 5 countries. Eligibility criteria included stage ≤ T2b, PSA ≤ 15 ng/mL, and Grade Group (GG) 1-2 disease. The protocol prescribed a single whole-gland TULSA treatment sparing the prostatic urethra and urinary sphincter, and repeat TULSA was not allowed. The primary endpoints were PSA reduction and adverse events, both assessed at 1 year. Histologic control on 10-core biopsy, and prostate volume reduction on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) were also assessed at 1 year. Other secondary endpoints, assessed to 5 years, included adverse events, quality of life, PSA, and the rate of salvage treatment.
Results
Baseline (median [IQR]) age and PSA were 65 (59-69) years and 6.3 (4.6-7.9) ng/mL, with ≥GG2 disease in 72/115 men. At 1y, median prostate volume decreased from 37.3 to 2.8 cc (92%); 94/111 (85%) were free of ≥GG2 disease. By 5y, median (IQR) PSA decreased to 0.6 (0.18-1.9) ng/mL (n=68); 25 (21.7%) received salvage treatment (10 prostatectomy, 11 radiotherapy, 3 ADT, 1 surgery+radiation) without unexpected complications. Early predictors of treatment failure by 5 years included 1y PSA (OR=3; CI[1.7,5.4]) and visible lesion on 1y mpMRI (OR=12; CI[4.4,34]) (both p≤0.001). Failure modes include undertreatment due to patient selection or targeting error, and misalignment caused by intraprocedural swelling/motion. By 5 years, 61/66 (92%) recovered pad-free continence; 80/92 (87%) preserved erections sufficient for penetration. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 12 men (10%), with no Grade≥4 event or rectal injury.
Conclusions
Effective disease control is durable to 5 years after a single TULSA procedure, with a favorable safety profile. Favorable preservation of genitourinary quality of life is also durable to 5 years. Treatment failure modes include screening and intraprocedural factors. While the pivotal study represents early experience with TULSA, the risk of failure is mitigated by modern protocols. Such protocols include best practices for screening for intraprostatic calcifications that can lead to undertreatment, refined strategies for device positioning, and thermal dose escalation to address undertreatment that is visible on intraprocedural imaging. Factors from intraprocedural imaging and early clinical follow-up can predict salvage therapy by 5 years.}

abstract = {This study describes a case of Calodium hepaticum (Trichinellida: Capillariidae) infection in an adult rat (Rattus rattus) from the periurban area of the city of La Plata in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The rat was found with neurological signs (ataxia, lethargy, and episodes of unresponsiveness) in the food storage of a goat production facility. The liver was observed with hepatomegaly and diffuse and irregular yellowish-white spots appearing in striae or small nodules on the external surface and inside the liver. Subsequent microscopic and histopathological studies were performed. Eggs were observed by direct microscopy of the impression smear of liver tissue. A multifocal granulomatous tissue reaction with different stages of fibrocellular tissue was observed in the liver parenchyma. The granulomas contained adults and degenerated eggs delimited by an intense infiltrate of mononuclear cells. Macro and microscopic observations and histopathological liver lesions were compatible with C. hepaticum infection. To our knowledge, this is the first confirmation of C. hepaticum infection in R. rattus in Argentina, increasing the host record of this parasite and a new record of distribution in goat production systems in the country.}

A significant challenge in developing and deploying such AI models is ensuring they generalize efficiently across diverse visual domains. This challenge is driven by limited data availability of high quality and the substantial effort required for labeling such datasets. This paper explores the adaptation of a Vision Transformer (ViT), originally trained to identify aesthetic defects in battery modules, for application in moulded plastic parts. By using transfer learning and generative AI techniques, this study evaluates fine-tuning and synthetic data augmentation strategies. The proposed approaches are assessed for their potential to enhance model adaptability and reduce dependency on extensive labelled datasets. A case study involving a battery manufacturing company with real-world data serves as the basis for this evaluation. Our preliminary findings suggest promising directions for enhancing the flexibility and efficacy of AI-driven defect detection systems in diverse manufacturing environments.}

This lack of adaptability makes the deployment of AI/ML solutions in network monitoring a daunting task, as each new scenario requires significant reconfiguration, manual tuning, and retraining efforts, undermining the broader adoption of AI/ML for network traffic analysis. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), pre-trained on vast and diverse time-series datasets, offer a promising alternative in the network monitoring realm by enabling zero-shot and few-shot adaptability across different monitoring scenarios. In this work, we explore the potential of TSFMs for network monitoring by evaluating their performance in a challenging analysis task: estimating video streaming Quality of Experience (QoE) from encrypted network traffic. Our study assesses the zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of state-of-the-art TSFMs, the impact of time-series granularity, and the role of common traffic features in performance. Using real-world video streaming QoE datasets, we show that TSFMs achieve competitive results in a zero-shot setting — plug-and-play approach, and that their performance can be easily and cost-effectively improved through few-shot learning techniques, even when applied on NetFlow-like features with coarse granularity. Beyond the specific video streaming QoE monitoring application, our findings demonstrate the viability and broader applicability of TSFMs to network monitoring tasks, opening the door to more scalable and generalizable network management solutions.}

The increasing presence of traditional or new forms of robots at work demonstrates how the copresence of workers and robots might reframe work and workplaces and consequently arouse new human resource management (HRM) questions regarding how to manage the spatiotemporal change of work in organizations. Based on a spatiotemporal perspective, this conceptual article examines the implication of new spatiotemporal dynamics of work, which are generated by the interaction between workers and traditional or new forms of robots that are driven by advanced digital technologies, for HRM.
Design/methodology/approach
The article begins by carrying out a selective review focusing on the studies that enhanced the comprehension of the digital-driven spatiotemporal dynamics of work. It then presents a spatiotemporal framework from which it examines the implications of digital-driven spatiotemporal work boundaries for HRM. The article ends by underscoring the theoretical and empirical importance of taking more interest in new spatiotemporal forms of work for developing the HRM of the future.
Findings
By developing the notion of workuniverses, which denotes the spatiotemporal boundaries generated by the act of working through the interaction between workers and different forms of robots, this research first develops a theoretical framework that discerns three forms of spatiotemporal dynamics forming workuniverses at different levels and two spatiotemporal arrays for managing the spatiotemporal change of work in organizations. The HRM questions and ethical concerns generated by the formation of workuniverses are then revealed through four focuses: the management ethics in workuniverses, individuals' spatiotemporal well-being, collective spatiotemporal coordination and spatiotemporal change management in workuniverses.
Originality/value
This research provides an original perspective, which is the spatiotemporal perspective, to examine the new spatiotemporal dynamics that form workuniverses and the HRM questions and concerns generated by the increasing interaction between workers and different forms of digital-driven robots.}

abstract = {Purpose
Surveys to assess views about artificial intelligence (AI) of various diagnostic radiology constituencies have revealed interesting combinations of enthusiasm, caution, and implementation priorities. We surveyed academic radiology leaders about their views on AI and how they intend to approach AI implementation in their departments.
Materials and methods
We conducted a web survey of Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments members between October 5 and October 31, 2023, to solicit optimism or pessimism about AI, target use cases, planned implementation, and perceptions of their workforce. P values are provided only for descriptive purposes and have not been adjusted for multiple testing in this exploratory research.
Results
The survey was sent to the 112 Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments members and 43 responded (38%). Chairs were optimistic, with no statistical difference between views of AI in general versus generative AI. Chairs plan to implement AI to improve quality and efficiency (43 of 43, 100%), burnout (41 of 43, 95%), health care costs (22 of 43, 51%), and equity (27 of 43, 63%) and most likely will target the postprocessing (26 of 43, 60%), interpretation workflow (26 of 43, 60%), and image acquisition (18 of 43, 42%) steps in the imaging value chain. Chairs perceived that radiologists (36 of 43, 84%) and technologists (38 of 43, 88%) were not particularly worried about being displaced but saw trainees as slightly less confident (31 of 43, 72%). Free text responses revealed concerns about the cost of AI and emphasized trade-offs that needed to be balanced.
Conclusion
Radiology chairs are optimistic about AI and poised to tackle departmental challenges. Concerns about generative AI and workforce replacement are minimal.}

Based on this analysis, the article argues that humans and AI need to work together to minimize errors, reduce risks, maximize performance, and enhance the attainment of organizational goals. Rather than viewing AI as a tool to reduce headcount, organizations should see it as an opportunity to enhance human work and maximize value for the organization by restructuring roles, workflows, and learning systems around the unique strengths of human employees and AI.

This study investigates how brand-imposed language constraints affect engagement in sponsored influencer content. Drawing on Media Naturalness Theory and the control paradox, we hypothesize that language formality disrupts the authenticity of influencer communication, leading to lower engagement. Using a dataset of 1.4 million Instagram posts, including around 200,000 sponsored postings, our analysis reveals that formal language reduces engagement, while informal language features, specifically higher use of netspeak and emojis, enhance engagement. To further validate these findings, we conducted a controlled experiment examining the effect of language style on engagement and perceived authenticity. These findings suggest that informal language fosters a more genuine connection between influencers and their audiences, increasing interaction in sponsored content. The paper provides practical recommendations for brands, urging them to co-create flexible language strategies with influencers, allowing for more authentic expression and boosting consumer engagement. The current study also uses the latest agentic AI models to replicate similar results through additional experiments, contributing to the theoretical understanding of influencer marketing and the practical strategies for optimizing influencer collaborations.}

Oxidative stress (OS) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ischemia. In this study, the effect of melatonin and N-acetylcysteine on ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative stress injury in the cerebral cortex of male rats was investigated. 30 male Wistar rats were divided into sham, ischemic, NAC, melatonin and NAC + melatonin groups. All groups, except the sham group, underwent MCAO on the left side, and the treatment groups received intraperitoneal injections of either 50 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or 5 mg/kg melatonin or a combination of both 24 and 48 hours later. At 24 and 72 hours after surgery, the animals were examined for sensory and motor activity. The cerebral cortex was dissected after sacrificing the rats, infarct volume estimated and the concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicate that the NAC + melatonin group exhibited elevated sensory-motor activity and a reduced infarct volume rate in comparison to the ischemic group (p≤ 0.05). Compared to the ischemic group, the NAC + melatonin group showed a significant increase in SOD concentration and a significant decrease in MDA (p≤ 0.05). It can therefore be concluded that the simultaneous administration of NAC and melatonin can reduce the cerebral infarction volume, and improve neurological functions by modulating SOD and MDA.}

Cost-effectiveness analyse (CEA) generate extensive data that can support much health economic research. However, manual data collection is time-consuming and prone to errors. Development in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) offers a solution for automating this process. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-based data extraction and assess its feasibility for supporting CEA data collection.
Methods
We evaluated the performance of the custom ChatGPT model (GPT), the Tufts CEA Registry (TCRD), and the researcher-validated data (RVE) in extracting 36 predetermined variables from 34 selected structured articles. Concordance rates between GPT and RVE, TCRD and RVE, and GPT and TCRD were calculated and compared. Paired student’s t tests assessed differences in accuracy, and concordance rates across 36 variables were provided.
Results
The accuracy of GPT (GPT & RVE) was comparable to the accuracy of TCRD (TCRD & RVE) (mean 0.88, SD 0.06 vs mean 0.90, SD 0.06, P = .71). The performance of GPT varied across variables. GPT outperformed TCRD in capturing “Population and Intervention Details” but struggled with complex variables like “Utility.”
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that LLMs, such as GPT, can be a promising tool for automating CEA data extraction, offering comparable accuracy to established registries. However, human supervision and expertise is essential to address challenges in complex variables.}

To explore how changes in planned retirement age, practice setting, and physician productivity may impact the workforce shortage in urology.
Methods
We compared data between the 2015 and 2022 American Urological Association census, a specialty-wide annual survey which collects data on demographics, practice patterns, and procedures from a representative sample of U.S. urologists. Workforce productivity was measured by the self-reported number of hours worked per week and patients seen per week. A novel formula was developed to demonstrate how planned retirement age and productivity impact the workforce’s production capacity.
Results
The total number of practicing urologists increased during the period from 2015 to 2022 (11,990 to 13,976), while the mean age of practicing urologists decreased slightly (55.0 to 54.5years; P < .002). During this period, the mean planned age of retirement for all urologists decreased from 68.9years to 67.7 (P < .001). Urologists in solo practice had a significantly higher planned age of retirement at 71.9years (P < .001) as compared to all other practice models. The number of patients seen per week for all urologists decreased from 78.7 to 72.9 (P < .001). The amount of hours worked per week remained relatively constant between the study periods. The maximum possible number of patients seen by the workforce prior to retirement increased by only 2.4% during the study interval.
Conclusion
Though the U.S. urology workforce is growing and the mean age is decreasing, decreases in planned retirement age and productivity may offset these gains and intensify the physician shortage for U.S. urologists.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objectives
Timely access to current rheumatology guidelines at the point of care is challenging. We aimed to develop and evaluate the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed for adult rheumatology, integrating European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines to provide rheumatologists with timely evidence-based recommendations.
Methods
EULAR and ACR management guidelines were selected by rheumatologists based on their clinical relevance for decision-making and processed. A RAG system was implemented. To evaluate it, 10 questions per guideline were generated using ChatGPT 4.5. Answers to these were produced by ChatGPT-o3-mini with context retrieval (RAG) and without (baseline). Performance was assessed by an Large language model (LLM)-as-a-judge (Gemini 2.0 Flash) using a 5-point Likert scale across 5 dimensions: relevance, factual accuracy, safety, completeness, and conciseness; it also determined preference between the RAG and baseline responses. For validation, 2 rheumatologists independently evaluated a random sample of questions (15%) on the same domains. Statistical significance was established using the Wilcoxon signed-rank and binomial tests.
Results
Seventy-four guidelines were included, yielding 740 evaluation questions. The LLM-as-a-judge evaluation showed the RAG system significantly outperformed the baseline across all criteria (P < .001). Manual evaluation confirmed these findings (P < .001) for accuracy, safety, and completeness. The RAG system was significantly preferred by the LLM-as-a-judge in 92.8% of comparisons and by the human evaluators in 71.2% to 74.8% (P < .001).
Conclusions
Developing a RAG system integrating extensive EULAR/ACR rheumatology guidelines improves answer quality compared to a baseline LLM. This evaluation provides a robust foundation for reliable, artificial intelligence-driven clinical decision support tools designed to enhance evidence-based practice by providing clinicians with rapid, context-aware access to recommendations.}

We performed a retrospective chart review of immediately postpartum patients in the ICU at an academic medical center between January 2018 and January 2024. Information regarding initiation, cessation, communication, and lactation consultant (LC) services were extracted and bivariate tests of association were conducted.
Results
Most immediately postpartum patients in the ICU initiated lactation (85% [87 of 102]), but only 70% (72 of 102) continued until hospital discharge. Documented lactation plans were present before delivery for 60% of patients, and a documented plan to initiate lactation before delivery was associated with increased odds of initiating lactation after delivery (OR, 9.21; 95% CI, 1.96-43.3; P = .005). Although most patients (75%) saw LCs, less than 30% of patients saw LCs within 24 hours of delivery. An association between seeing an LC and continuing lactation until hospital discharge was found (OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 1.77-12.7; P = .002). More than one-half of lactating patients received mechanical ventilation (55%), but nearly 20% of these intubated patients did not undergo milk expression while ventilated.
Interpretation
Most postpartum patients who are critically ill initiate lactation, but not all continue until hospital discharge. Having documented plans to lactate before delivery and seeing LCs were protective of lactation in the ICU, but many patients did not see LCs promptly. Additional gaps in care included lack of documentation and delays in lactation initiation in intubated patients. We hypothesize that these gaps may hinder patients who are critically ill from achieving their personal lactation goals, and steps should be taken to address and mitigate these challenges.}

abstract = {Over 1.3 million people die annually in traffic accidents, and this tragic fact highlights the urgent need to enhance the intelligence of traffic safety and control systems. In modern industrial and technological applications and collaborative edge intelligence, control systems are crucial for ensuring efficiency and safety. However, deficiencies in these systems can lead to significant operational risks. This paper uses edge intelligence to address the challenges of achieving target speeds and improving efficiency in vehicle control, particularly the limitations of traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers in managing nonlinear and time-varying dynamics, such as varying road conditions and vehicle behavior, which often result in substantial discrepancies between desired and actual speeds, as well as inefficiencies due to manual parameter adjustments. The paper uses edge intelligence to propose a novel PID control algorithm that integrates Backpropagation (BP) neural networks to enhance robustness and adaptability. The BP neural network is first trained to capture the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the vehicle. The trained network is then combined with the PID controller to form a hybrid control strategy. The output layer of the neural network directly adjusts the PID parameters (kp, ki, kd), optimizing performance for specific driving scenarios through self-learning and weight adjustments. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our BP neural network-based PID design significantly outperforms traditional methods, with the response time for acceleration from 0 to 1 m/s improved from 0.25 s to just 0.065 s. Furthermore, real-world tests on an intelligent vehicle show its ability to make timely adjustments in response to complex road conditions, ensuring consistent speed maintenance and enhancing overall system performance.}

abstract = {Background
Sex workers face an epidemic of violence around the world. However, violence against sex workers (VASW) is underreported, and sex workers hesitate to report to the police because they are frequently punished; therefore, an alternative for reporting is needed. Sex workers also face stigmatization from health care workers, further discouraging help-seeking behavior or reporting in health care facilities. Sex workers have been recipients of services from nongovernmental organizations, typically related to HIV and sexual transmission of infections, but violence remains underaddressed.
Objective
This study aims to apply human-centered design methods to adapt ReportVASW for use in the Middle East and North Africa and to evaluate the usability of the prototype interface and identify opportunities for improvement.
Methods
Evaluation methods included cognitive walkthrough and System Usability Scale by 9 potential end users, and heuristic evaluation by 2 informatics professionals and 2 service providers.
Results
This study explores ways to improve the trilingual prototype of ReportVASW, with particular attention to ways to improve the data collection tool. Multiple methods identified multiple issues to address. Heuristic analysis revealed 2 serious issues to address, with scores over 2.5 out of 4 in the tool used. The most serious problems identified in heuristic analysis were related to language, particularly the Arabic version. Translation issues were addressed before end user testing. End users were enthusiastic about the idea of a mobile tool to document VASW, provided it led to change. They gave ReportVASW a System Usability Scale of 91.4, above the 68 considered good. Even as end users were enthusiastic, they offered suggestions for improvement.
Conclusions
Many opportunities to improve the interface were identified. Most changes are not overly complex, and the majority involve adapting the language used and improving the translation. Development of the trilingual ReportVASW data collection tool for the Middle East and North Africa region is worth pursuing.}

abstract = {Background
Limited evidence is available comparing the modified transtibial (MTT) and transportal (TP) techniques in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and their impact on returning to sports participation. The objective was to analyze the outcomes after arthroscopic reconstruction of the ACL in recreational athletes with a 2-year postoperative follow-up, comparing the MTT and TP techniques, based on the method used to drill the femoral tunnel.
Hypotesis
The rate of return to sport would be comparable regardless of the surgical technique used.
Material and methods
A retrospective study was conducted with 66 patients who underwent arthroscopic monofascicular ACL reconstruction between September 2016 and March 2020. Patients aged between 16 and 50 years old, recreational athletes at Tegner levels 6 and 7, with a 2-year follow-up were included. Groups were established for comparative analysis (MTT vs TP) based on the method for drilling the femoral tunnel. The main outcome variable was the return to sport at the same level. Secondary variables included patient satisfaction evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and knee function according to the Lysholm scale.
Results
At 2 years of postoperative follow-up, the return to sport rate was 30.3 % in the MTT group and 33.3 % in the TP group (p = 0.791). There were no significant differences between both groups in patient satisfaction (p = 0.664) and knee function (p = 0.113).
Conclusion
Drilling the femoral tunnel with the MTT and TP techniques did not influence the rate of return to sport, patient satisfaction, and knee function in recreational athletes with 2 years of postoperative follow-up.

abstract = {Background
The effective implementation of personalized pharmacogenomics (PGx) requires the integration of released clinical guidelines into decision support systems to facilitate clinical applications. Large language models (LLMs) can be valuable tools for automating information extraction and updates.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of repeated cross-comparisons and an agreement-threshold strategy in 2 advanced LLMs as supportive tools for updating information.
Methods
The study evaluated the performance of 2 LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, in extracting PGx clinical guidelines and comparing their outputs with expert-annotated evaluations. The 2 LLMs classified 385 PGx clinical guidelines, with each recommendation tested 20 times per model. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with manually labeled data. Two prospectively defined strategies were used to identify inconsistent predictions. The first involved repeated cross-comparison, flagging discrepancies between the most frequent classifications from each model. The second used a consistency threshold strategy, which designated predictions appearing in less than 60% of the 40 combined outputs as unstable. Cases flagged by either strategy were subjected to manual review. This study also estimated the overall cost of model use and was conducted between October 1 and November 30, 2024.
Results
GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro yielded reproducibility rates of 97.8% (7534/7700) and 98.9% (7612/7700), respectively, based on the most frequent classification for each query. Compared with expert labels, GPT-4o achieved 93.5% accuracy (Cohen κ=0.90; P<.001) and Gemini-1.5-Pro 92.7% accuracy (Cohen κ=0.89; P<.001). Both models demonstrated high overall performance, with comparable weighted average F1-scores (GPT-4o: 0.929; Gemini: 0.935). The models generated consistent predictions for 341 of 385 guideline items, reducing the need for manual review by 88.6%. Among these agreed-upon cases, only one (0.3%) diverged from expert labels. Applying a predefined agreement-threshold strategy further reduced the number of priority manual review cases to 2.9% (11/385), although the error rate slightly increased to 0.5% (2/374). The inconsistencies identified through these methods prompted the prioritization of manual review to minimize errors and enhance clinical applicability. The total combined cost of using both LLMs was only US $0.76.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that using 2 LLMs can effectively streamline PGx guideline integration into clinical decision support systems while maintaining high performance and minimal cost. Although selective manual review remains necessary, this approach offers a practical and scalable solution for PGx guideline classification in clinical workflows.}

However, the rapid evolution of Agentic AI, including Generative AI (GenAI) agents, has outpaced a cohesive understanding of its applications, challenges, and strategic implications. This narrative review explores the role of Agentic AI in shaping an intelligent future, focusing on its key attributes—autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and learning ability—and its potential to transform organizational performance. We identify a research gap in synthesizing the diverse capabilities of Agentic AI (e.g., multimodal processing, hierarchical architectures, and machine learning outsourcing) and providing actionable strategies for adoption. The paper examines how Agentic AI enables autonomous decision-making, automates processes, and enhances efficiency through tools like LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and AutoGPT. It highlights the transition from assisted ("Copilot") to autonomous ("Autopilot") models and the importance of hierarchical agent structures for system coordination. Key contributions include a framework for organizations to formulate GenAI strategies, addressing business needs, tool selection, human resource training, and risk management. Findings reveal that Agentic AI significantly improves productivity, reduces costs, and drives innovation, though challenges such as privacy, security, and ethical concerns remain. Future research should focus on industry-specific case studies to deepen understanding, explore the ethical and social impacts (e.g., privacy, data security, labor market effects), and investigate the integration of Agentic AI with emerging technologies like quantum computing. This review provides a foundation for researchers and practitioners to leverage Agentic AI effectively while addressing its limitations and opportunities.}

Children and young people (CYP) with cerebral palsy (CP) may have multiple associated co-morbidities, including sleep disorders. Sleep disorders, including sleep disordered breathing, are more prevalent among CYP with CP compared to typically developing children due to several contributory factors. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) collectively represents several different pathologies, namely obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), central sleep apnoea (CSA), and hypoventilation. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to each of these pathologies. Sleep studies (either as polysomnography or cardiorespiratory polygraphy) allow the detection of effort and apnoea, with contemporaneous measurement of oxygen saturations (SpO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (tcpCO2). Together these enable the diagnosis of SDB, and the delineation of OSA, CSA and/or hypoventilation. The multifactorial component of SDB among CYP with CP may require intervention ranging from conservative measures (e.g. nasopharyngeal airway, soft collar), surgical options (e.g. adenotonsillectomy), or the initiation of respiratory support. Respiratory support, delivered as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), has a key role in the management of SDB in children with CP though the journey can often be turbulent with a high failure rate. Nonetheless, CYP with CP are being increasingly commenced on respiratory support, often for reasons others than SDB, for example aiding airway clearance in order to reduce the frequency of lower respiratory tract infections. Open discussions between the parents and healthcare professionals are important in setting shared goals for CYP with CP, guided by the primary aim of improving quality of life.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded as one of the key technological innovations of the 21st century. Within healthcare, much attention has been placed upon the ability of deductive AI systems to analyse large datasets to find patterns that would be unfeasible to program. Generative AI, including generative adversarial networks, are a newer type of machine learning that functions to create fake data after learning the properties of real data. Artificially generated patient data has the potential to revolutionise clinical research and protect patient privacy. Using novel techniques, it is increasingly possible to fully anonymise datasets to the point where no datapoint is traceable to any real individual. This can be used to expand and balance datasets as well as to replace the use of real patient data in certain contexts. This paper focuses upon three key uses of synthetic data: clinical research, data privacy and medical education. We also highlight ethical and practical concerns that require consideration.}

Data from various sensors, such as cameras and thermal detectors, have become very common, but the incorporation of audio data remains largely unexplored. Audio is crucial in process monitoring and root cause analysis, providing early warnings of potential problems such as tool wear or spindle failures. Generating audio signals for different process states could revolutionize how factories predict failures and manage machinery, shifting from reactive to proactive monitoring. This paper proposes the first step in a new method to create audio and seamlessly integrate it into Virtual factories, enabling real-time sound generation that mirrors the sounds produced by different machinery and processes. For this paper, a dataset is created using the audio of a table CNC machine. The data set is formed using a simple Design of Experiments (DOE) with two process conditions and three levels. The model discussed in the paper is a convolutional auto-encoder that leverages the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of audio as input to generate audio. The model was trained for 6 h and can recreate audio that looks very close to the real audio with a mean square error of about 0.2027. Integrating audio with virtual reality (VR) will enhance the immersive experience of virtual factories, making training and process simulations more immersive. By generating real-time machine sounds, virtual reality environments will allow operators to practice identifying mechanical problems based on auditory cues, thus improving situational awareness and decision-making. This multi-sensory approach will bring better learning outcomes, reduce errors, and enhance safety in industrial training, which will enable users to anticipate and respond to potential machinery problems more effectively.}

Approximately half of the participants went to a special needs school, and 83 % rated their overall quality of life as good. We did not find a correlation between mobility and quality of life, whereas more social participation was correlated with higher quality of life. Furthermore, patients with more difficulties in executive functions showed less participation and lower quality of life.

abstract = {Intelligent search engines including pre-trained generative transformers (GPT) have revolutionized the user search experience. Several fields including e-commerce, education, and hospitality are increasingly exploring GPT tools to study user reviews and gain critical insights to improve their service quality. However, massive user-review data and imprecise prompt engineering lead to biased, irrelevant, and impersonal search results. In addition, exposing user data to these search engines may pose privacy issues. Motivated by these factors, we present ChatReview, a ChatGPT-enabled natural language processing (NLP) framework that effectively studies domain-specific user reviews to offer relevant and personalized search results at multiple levels of granularity. The framework accomplishes this task using four phases including data collection, tokenization, query construction, and response generation. The data collection phase involves gathering domain-specific user reviews from public and private repositories. In the tokenization phase, ChatReview applies sentiment analysis to extract keywords and categorize them into various sentiment classes. This process creates a token repository that best describes the user sentiments for a given user-review data. In the query construction phase, the framework uses the token repository and domain knowledge to construct three types of ChatGPT prompts including explicit, implicit, and creative. In the response generation phase, ChatReview pipelines these prompts into ChatGPT to generate search results at varying levels of granularity. We analyze our framework using three real-world domains including education, local restaurants, and hospitality. We assert that our framework simplifies prompt engineering for general users to produce effective results while minimizing the exposure of sensitive user data to search engines. We also present a one-of-a-kind Large Language Model (LLM) peer assessment of the ChatReview framework. Specifically, we employ Google’s Bard to objectively and qualitatively analyze the various ChatReview outputs. Our Bard-based analyses yield over 90% satisfaction, establishing ChatReview as a viable survey analysis tool.}

This study evaluated the accuracy and comprehensibility of responses from three large language models (LLMs)—ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot—when addressing patient queries about myopia. Accurate, understandable information is crucial for effective patient education and management of this common refractive error.
Methods
Sixty questions across six categories (definition, etiology, symptoms and diagnosis, myopia control, correction, and new treatments) were presented to ChatGPT-4, Gemini, and Copilot. Responses were assessed for accuracy by two experienced ophthalmologists using a 3-point Likert scale. Quality and reliability were evaluated using the DISCERN and EQIP scales, while readability was measured with the Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Coleman-Liau Index. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.
Results
ChatGPT-4 provided the most accurate responses in the defsinition, symptoms, and diagnosis categories, with a 75 % overall success rate. Copilot had a similar success rate of 73.3 % but the highest inaccuracy rate (6.7 %). Gemini had a 71.7 % success rate. Copilot scored highest in reliability (DISCERN 76) and readability (Flesch Reading Ease 46.74), followed by ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. No significant differences in accuracy were found among the LLMs across categories.
Conclusions
All three LLMs performed well in providing myopia-related information. Copilot excelled in readability and reliability despite a higher inaccuracy rate. ChatGPT-4 and Copilot outperformed Gemini, likely due to their advanced architectures and training methodologies. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in patient education and the need for ongoing improvements to ensure accurate, comprehensible AI-generated health information.}

abstract = {Language learning is increasingly being extended into digital and online spaces that have been enhanced by simulated reality and augmented with data and artificial intelligence. While this may expand opportunities for language learning, some critics argue that digital spaces may represent a pastiche or a parody of reality. However, while there are genuine issues, such criticisms may often fall back on naïve or essentialist views of authenticity, in particular by narrowing language learning scenarios to real-life or genuine communication. I argue that research undersocialises authenticity by not taking social relations into sufficient consideration, which denies or elides the ways that authenticity is achieved. In this conceptual paper, I offer a relational account of authenticity, where I conceive digital environments within a stratified ontological framework, where authenticity is not inherent in individuals or texts, but instead emerges from complex social contexts. Authenticity, then, does not refer to authenticity of texts or “being oneself”, but authenticity in relation to others. A stratified ontology provides opportunities to extend relations with others, offering what is described as a “submersion into a temporary agency”, where language learners can experiment with the social order in order to achieve authenticity of themselves in the target language. Finally, I present a relational pedagogy based on responsiveness, where feedback is distributed among disparate human and technical actors which facilitate, problematise or endorse authenticity.}

abstract = {Objective
To analyze our experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Design
Retrospective, observational, single center study.
Setting
Third-level hospital in Spain.
Patients
Adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS treated with an ECMO system in our center between March 2020 and March 2023.
Interventions
Retrospective collection of variables during hospital admission and follow-up.
Main Variables of Interest
Demographic variables, clinical history, variables related to ECMO therapy, COVID-19 wave number, in-hospital mortality, adverse events, ICU and hospital length of stay, and functional status at follow-up were collected.
Results
Eighty-one patients were included. Of these, 61 patients (75%) died during hospitalization. Patients who died were older and had more comorbidities. During the second, third, and sixth waves, mortality was higher. In the multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of mortality was age (OR 1.24 95% CI (1.027–1.5, P = 0.025). After discharge, 40% of patients had difficulties returning to normal life due to respiratory failure requiring oxygen and arthropathies.
Conclusion
In-hospital mortality increased during the pandemic. Older age was the only independent predictor of mortality. After discharge, no deaths were recorded during the first 18 months of follow-up, although 40% of surviving patients had respiratory and motor sequelae making it difficult for them to return to a normal life.
Resumen
Objetivo
Analizar nuestra experiencia con la terapia de soporte con membrana de oxigenación extracorpórea (ECMO) para tratar el síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo (SDRA) durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
Diseño
Estudio retrospectivo y observacional de un único centro.
Ámbito
Hospital de tercer nivel en España.
Pacientes
Pacientes adultos con COVID-19 tratados con sistema ECMO por SDRA en nuestro centro entre Marzo 2020 y Marzo 2023.

abstract = {Background
Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a crucial outcome for cancer patients, providing a comprehensive measure of patient well-being beyond traditional clinical endpoints. While HRQoL data are increasingly available from real-world data (RWD), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies, they remain fragmented, limiting their utility for large-scale analysis. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group’s BALANCE project aims to address this by pooling and harmonizing international HRQoL datasets for breast cancer patients.
Materials and methods
This article describes the challenges of pooling international HRQoL datasets, including the process of dataset identification, acquisition, and harmonization within the BALANCE project.
Results
We successfully pooled and harmonized six datasets, representing 6500 patients and over 30 000 observations from diverse RCTs, observational studies, and RWD sources. The resulting database includes 142 variables across demographic, clinical, and HRQoL domains. Challenges included various interpretations of the General Data Protection Regulation across Europe, related to data protection and ownership. Furthermore, inconsistent data collection and resource limitations (e.g. funding or personnel) required iterative negotiations and customized harmonization. This led to the exclusion of 17 datasets containing an estimated number of 20 000-22 500 patients.
Conclusions
The BALANCE project demonstrates the feasibility of pooling international HRQoL data by overcoming key barriers and creating one of the largest HRQoL datasets for breast cancer. It lays the groundwork for upcoming publications focused on developing and validating prediction models. Future research should focus on adopting standardized data models, including secondary use clauses in consent forms, and establishing RWD registries to facilitate data sharing.}
