Introducción y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial (IA) generativa permite preguntar, a través de los cuadros de diálogo, sobre patologías médicas. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar la calidad de la información acerca de las patologías urológicas más comunes en los chatbots ChatGPT de OpenIA, BARD de Google y Copilot de Microsoft.
Material y método
Se realizó un análisis de la información aportada por IA sobre las siguientes patologías y sus tratamientos: cáncer de próstata, cáncer renal, cáncer de vejiga, litiasis urinarias e hipertrofia benigna de próstata (HBP). A través de cuadros de diálogo se formularon preguntas estructuradas en inglés y en español, recopilando las respuestas para analizarlas posteriormente con cuestionarios DISCERN y sobre la idoneidad global de la respuesta. Los tratamientos quirúrgicos se realizaron con cuestionario de consentimiento informado.
Resultados
Las respuestas obtenidas a través de los tres chatbots explicaron la patología, detallaron los factores de riesgo y describieron los tratamientos. La diferencia radica en que BARD y Copilot aportan citas de información externa, algo que ChatGPT no realiza. Las puntuaciones DISCERN más altas, en números absolutos, se obtuvieron en Copilot; sin embargo, en la escala de idoneidad se objetivó que sus respuestas no fueron las más apropiadas. Las mejores puntuaciones de tratamientos quirúrgicos fueron obtenidas por BARD, seguido de ChatGPT y finalmente de Copilot.
Conclusiones
Las respuestas obtenidas de la IA generativa sobre enfermedades urológicas dependieron de la formulación de la pregunta. La información proporcionada presentó sesgos importantes, dependiendo de la patología, del idioma y, sobre todo, del cuadro de diálogo consultado.
Introduction and objective
Generative artificial intelligence makes it possible to ask about medical pathologies in dialog boxes. Our objective was to analyze the quality of information about the most common urological pathologies provided by ChatGPT (OpenIA), BARD (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft).
Methods
We analyzed information on the following pathologies and their treatments as provided by AI: prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, urinary lithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Questions in English and Spanish were posed in dialog boxes; the answers were collected and analyzed with DISCERN questionnaires and the overall appropriateness of the response. Surgical procedures were performed with an informed consent questionnaire.
Results
The responses from the three chatbots explained the pathology, detailed risk factors, and described treatments. The difference is that BARD and Copilot provide external information citations, which ChatGPT does not. The highest DISCERN scores, in absolute numbers, were obtained in Copilot; however, on the appropriacy scale it was noted that their responses were not the most appropriate. The best surgical treatment scores were obtained by BARD, followed by ChatGPT, and finally Copilot.
Conclusions
The answers obtained from generative AI on urological diseases depended on the formulation of the question. The information provided had significant biases, depending on pathology, language, and above all, the dialog box consulted.}

The analysis identifies six fundamental strategic research themes, ranging from automation and predictive analysis to the personalisation of the employee experience. The paper illustrates the growing importance of AI and HRM, evidenced by an exponential increase in publications since 2016, with a significant peak after the COVID-19 pandemic. The conclusions highlight the need for a balanced approach that integrates technological innovation with rigorous ethical principles, particularly in critical areas such as algorithmic transparency, fairness in decision-making and personal data management. The research also provides a valuable roadmap for future research and sustainable organisational practices in the digital age, highlighting the importance of addressing emerging challenges such as technostress and the implications of personalisation in hybrid work environments. In addition to capturing the ways in which AI is transforming traditional HRM processes and the aspects covered by the literature so far, this paper also establishes a frame of reference for understanding and addressing the evolution of talent management in a rapidly changing technological context.}

abstract = {Generative AI with stronger responsiveness and emergent abilities has triggered a global boom and is facing challenges such as data compliance risks during the pretraining process and risks of generating fake information, which has raised concerns among global regulatory authorities. The European Union, United States, United Kingdom, and other countries and regions are gradually establishing risk-based, scenario-based, and outcome-based governance models for generative AI. China recently introduced new regulations for the management of generative AI, which adopt a governance model focusing on generative AI service providers. It suggests that China is continuing the principle of primary responsibility in Internet governance, which encompasses legal responsibility, contractual obligations, and ethical responsibility. However, the governance model based on primary responsibility emphasizes the accountability of generative AI model service providers, with relatively limited regulation on other important entities such as users and large-scale dissemination platforms, which may not be conducive to achieving China's regulatory goals for the AI industry. In comparison, the Meta-Regulation model could be an ideal alternative for China. As a classic theory explaining the public-private relationship, the ‘Meta-Regulation’ aligns with the generative AI governance requirements. Based on the Meta-Regulation theory, the governance of generative AI in China should move towards a direction of emphasizing safety, transparency, collaborative governance, and accountability. In line with this, it is necessary to include users and large-scale dissemination platforms within the regulatory scope and establish overarching governance objectives that ensure the responsible distribution of duties among stakeholders, with regulatory authorities assuming ultimate oversight responsibility and technical coordination. At the level of specific improvement measures, it is possible to integrate the three stages of model development, usage, and content dissemination of generative AI. During the model development stage, generative AI providers have specific transparency obligations. In the usage stage, a self-regulatory system centered around platform autonomy should be constructed. In the content dissemination stage, the proactive notification obligations of the dissemination platforms should be clearly defined. Additionally, the enforcement of technical interoperability requirements is necessary, thereby promoting the orderly development of generative AI applications.}

In recent years, a growing number of scholars have begun to apply AI to the TCM sector, achieving notable progress.This paper focuses on four key domains: intelligent TCM health management, the intelligent TCM clinical diagnosis and treatment, intelligent TCM academic inheritance and innovation and intelligent TCM industry chain. It systematically reviews practical applications of AI in each of these areas. Furthermore, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the existing challenges in integrating AI with TCM, including the underdeveloped standardization system, insufficient foundational data, lack of model transparency and interpretability, and the urgent need for improved ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks. These limitations hinder the deep integration of AI into TCM. Only through a comprehensive understanding and effective resolution of these issues can AI be fully embedded into TCM practices, fostering innovation in the field and contributing Chinese wisdom and solutions to global health initiatives.}

The earliest paradigm (craft production) and the current transformation (regionalized/personalized production) share a fundamental characteristic—high product variety and low product volume. In both cases, co-creation between the customer and the producer is essential. In the co-creation process, high-level product information (i.e., linguistic descriptions of a product) must be translated into machine-readable formats such as CAD models. However, the short design cycle and the lack of necessary tools and expertise in CAD modeling pose significant challenges. This study examines a fundamental issue: how to frame the CAD model creation problem in a way that enables novice users to obtain a desired solution efficiently. Findings indicate that empathetic adaptation provides structured guidelines for iterative prompting, helping novices navigate CAD modeling tasks more effectively. The study thus highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) in addressing highly knowledge-intensive challenges within personalized production.}

abstract = {Background
The persistence of diagnostic errors, despite advances in medical knowledge and diagnostics, highlights the importance of understanding atypical disease presentations and their contribution to mortality and morbidity. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative pre-trained transformers like GPT-4, holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy, but requires further exploration in handling atypical presentations.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT in generating differential diagnoses for atypical presentations of common diseases, with a focus on the model’s reliance on patient history during the diagnostic process.
Methods
We used 25 clinical vignettes from the Journal of Generalist Medicine characterizing atypical manifestations of common diseases. Two general medicine physicians categorized the cases based on atypicality. ChatGPT was then used to generate differential diagnoses based on the clinical information provided. The concordance between AI-generated and final diagnoses was measured, with a focus on the top-ranked disease (top 1) and the top 5 differential diagnoses (top 5).
Results
ChatGPT’s diagnostic accuracy decreased with an increase in atypical presentation. For category 1 (C1) cases, the concordance rates were 17% (n=1) for the top 1 and 67% (n=4) for the top 5. Categories 3 (C3) and 4 (C4) showed a 0% concordance for top 1 and markedly lower rates for the top 5, indicating difficulties in handling highly atypical cases. The χ2 test revealed no significant difference in the top 1 differential diagnosis accuracy between less atypical (C1+C2) and more atypical (C3+C4) groups (χ²1=2.07; n=25; P=.13). However, a significant difference was found in the top 5 analyses, with less atypical cases showing higher accuracy (χ²1=4.01; n=25; P=.048).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 demonstrates potential as an auxiliary tool for diagnosing typical and mildly atypical presentations of common diseases. However, its performance declines with greater atypicality. The study findings underscore the need for AI systems to encompass a broader range of linguistic capabilities, cultural understanding, and diverse clinical scenarios to improve diagnostic utility in real-world settings.}

abstract = {Educational feedback research is shifting from feedback provision to feedback reception, but more theory-based studies on student feedback engagement are still needed for targeted interventions. In higher education, promoting feedback engagement can streamline study trajectories and reduce fail and dropout rates. This study focused on first-year university students (N = 392) receiving feedback on their program-specific validated academic achievement prediction, based on various background/(non-)cognitive variables, along with remediation and competence training recommendations. Using a Theory of Planned Behavior model, we analyzed students' intentional (IFE) and behavioral (BFE) feedback engagement, as well as their feedback self-efficacy (FSE) and received feedback. Results show IFE positively influences BFE, while FSE positively affects IFE. Feedback indicating a higher chance of study success increases FSE. IFE fully mediates the relationship between FSE and BFE, and FSE between students’ received feedback and IFE. We discuss directing educational interventions towards enhancing FSE to promote student feedback engagement.}

After presenting a conceptual distinction between matter, material, and materiality—here defined as a socially constructed, relational phenomenon—the paper examines ongoing and potential shifts in the materiality of buildings driven by the rise of digital design and the adaptation to the challenges of the Anthropocene. Key topics include the movement from form to process in contemporary design, the renewed centrality of materials, the “material turn” in the humanities and social sciences, and the return of ornament. In conclusion, architecture is described as both a medium and a regulator of the human relationship to the material world.}

abstract = {Background
MET gene exon 14 skipping was identified as a potential driver mutation that occurs in approximately 3%-4% of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), typically in the absence of other driver mutations. Capmatinib and tepotinib were the first MET- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MET-TKIs) approved by the FDA and PMDA, specifically for patients with metastatic NSCLC. Several studies have reported acquired resistance after MET-TKI treatment for MET mutation-positive NSCLC. Sequencing of the MET kinase region of resistant cell lines revealed secondary mutations at residues D1228 and Y1230 that were sensitive to type II MET-TKIs, such as cabozantinib. This suggested that sequential administration of other MET-TKIs may overcome the development of secondary mutations after acquired resistance in MET exon 14 mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We designed the single arm phase II study CAPTURE Trial to assess the efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC with activating MET exon 14 alterations who developed acquired resistance to tepotinib or capmatinib, as well as after 2 prior chemotherapy regimens that included platinum and docetaxel. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by independent review committees. The sample size (n = 30) is calculated by assuming a threshold response rate of 5% and an expected response rate of 25%. Recruitment began in August 2024.
Results
This ongoing study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib after acquired resistance to tepotinib or capmatinib.}

Anaesthesia for cases involving quadruplets or higher order pregnancy is poorly described: literature review identified only nine cases detailing the conduct of anaesthesia. We present a case of spontaneous quad-chorionic quad-amniotic pregnancy in a 34-year-old patient with two prior CDs, who underwent elective CD at 30 + 5 weeks’ gestation under combined spinal epidural (CSE) anaesthesia with a reduced-dose intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% 2.0 mL and diamorphine 300 μg. Key clinical considerations include aortocaval compression and spinal hypotension, heightened risks of haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, eclampsia, preterm delivery and perinatal morbidity. Despite pregnancy induced hypertension, surgery proceeded uneventfully, with an operating time of 46 minutes and 350 mL blood loss. Four live neonates (weighing 1300–1345 g) were delivered and admitted to the neonatal unit without major morbidity. No additional intraoperative analgesia or epidural anaesthesia top-up was required, and the patient reported high satisfaction with anaesthetic management. Postoperative recovery was complicated by maternal hypertension, managed with oral therapy, with hospital discharge on the 4th postoperative day. At 10 months post-delivery, the quadruplets continue to meet age-adjusted developmental milestones. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which low dose CSE anaesthesia was provided for a quadruplet or higher-order CD. The case description highlights the challenges associated with high-order multiple gestation pregnancy, and considerations for the anaesthetist in such cases.}

Furthermore, genetic markers have been used to identify genomic regions associated with economically important traits, which can help increase the genetic response through genomic selection. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate genetic parameters and perform a haplotype-based genome wide association study (GWAS) to identify genomic regions associated with indicator traits for endoparasite resistance in Santa Ines sheep. Haplotype GWAS was performed using linkage disequilibrium blocks (haploblocks) defined by the Haploview software. Records from 1725 animals for Famacha© (FAM, N = 5560), packed cell volume (PCV, N = 5135), total plasma protein (TPP, N = 4356), and fecal egg count (FEC, N = 4248) were used for analysis. The pedigree file contained information from 4821 animals; of these, 638 animals were genotyped using the Ovine SNP50 Genotyping BeadChip. Heritability estimates were moderate for FAM (0.26), PCV (0.26), TPP (0.16), and log-transformed FEC (0.19). Genomic regions that explained more than 0.3 % of the total additive genetic variance of the traits were defined as significant. These regions overlapped with quantitative traits loci associated with eosinophil number, fecal egg count, hematocrit, and immunoglobulin levels. In the top regions for the traits evaluated we found genes individually involved in inflammatory response, immunity, macrophage function in host-pathogen interactions, and other biological functions. All indicator traits for resistance to gastrointestinal parasites evaluated in this study exhibited sufficient genetic variability to respond to selection and can be used to improve the health and consequently the production of Santa Ines sheep.}

As ChatGPT is trained on published material, allowing it to find and parse relevant literature about prompted targets, it in theory is an ideal way to make literature reviews more efficient. As more academics use the tool, gauging the accuracy of the information gathered by this automation becomes important. Our research aims to assess the accuracy of literature found by ChatGPT when performing a systematic review. We searched PubMed for recent systematic reviews on chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes and hypertension) published before November 2022. Two researchers extracted aims and inclusion/exclusion criteria from each review. Using these criteria, we prompted ChatGPT to find 10 relevant articles. Researchers then cross-referenced ChatGPT’s results with Google Scholar, PubMed, and Tulane Library’s database. We categorized ChatGPT’s results as fake, real but not in the review, or matched with the review. If ChatGPT provided 10 real articles, we prompted it for another set. We calculated the rates of each outcome. Nine systematic reviews were selected to assess ChatGPT’s ability to conduct literature reviews. In total, ChatGPT found 90 articles after 9 sets of 10 articles each of 90 articles, 58% of articles were real but 38 (42%) of citations were for articles that did not exist. Additionally, of the 90 articles, only 16 (18%) matched articles in the systematic reviews. 38 (42%) were fake, 16 (18%) were real articles that matched the target review, and 36 (40%) were real articles but did not match the reviews. Furthermore, we never achieved 10/10 real articles in a single query. ChatGPT is a tool that can demonstrably make healthcare research tasks more efficient. However, healthcare decision and policy makers cannot yet rely on pure generative AI output without knowing whether humans were involved in the entire research process. And so, there appears to exist an ability ceiling above which the current ChatGPT algorithms cannot reach.}

abstract = {Purpose
Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed.
Findings
The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services.
Research limitations/implications
The study’s implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI’s impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.
Originality/value
This paper provides the latest statistical data on the use of AI technologies in US university libraries. It aims to help librarians understand the overall application situation and best practices. With these insights, librarians can develop corresponding plans to better use AI to serve patrons.}

An ideal decolorization algorithm should be both efficient and robust while preserving color consistency and detail contrast. In this study, we revisit the RTCP (Real-time Contrast-Preserving Decolorization) algorithm and propose three key optimizations: a clustering-guided decolorization approach, a locally adaptive decolorization strategy, and a weight-optimized decolorization method. To enhance solution quality, we implement a constrained particle swarm optimization framework to systematically explore the parameter space. Experimental validation on two standard datasets (Ĉadík and CSDD) demonstrates that our optimized methods handle diverse decolorization scenarios more effectively while maintaining competitive performance against existing approaches. Recognizing the limitations of current evaluation metrics in assessing detail contrast preservation, we introduce the D-C2G-SSIM metric for more accurate quantitative assessment. Comparative results show consistent improvements over the original RTCP algorithm, with the average D-C2G-SSIM score increasing from 0.8331 to 0.8442 on Ĉadík dataset and from 0.8696 to 0.8847 on the CSDD dataset, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.}

abstract = {Permeability is one of the most important properties of porous media, governing fluid flow and transport in subsurface reservoirs. However, accurately calculating permeability through conventional numerical simulations can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with complex pore structures. Therefore, rapid and precise prediction of permeability from digital rock images using deep learning and image-based regression is of particular interest. Yet, the generalizability and strength of deep learning models in computer vision tasks are often limited by low variability of existing datasets and labeling efforts. To mitigate such challenges, in this work, we introduce a new framework for improving permeability prediction with two complementary strategies. First, we expand the dataset by creating synthetic 2D digital rock images based on a diffusion model, which adds further data to the training set. Second, we embrace transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, thus increasing predictive performance in terms of permeability estimation tasks even without the presence of a large number of labeled samples. The framework presented demonstrates greater accuracy and generalization compared to traditional approaches, thus facilitating more reliable permeability prediction in the area of digital rock analysis. The innovation demonstrates potential for the use of generative modeling and transfer learning to drive data-driven solutions in subsurface characterization.}

The proposed workflow was implemented using GD-embedded software, Fusion (Autodesk Inc.), and tested by designing PSIs for one Le Fort I osteotomy case and one genioplasty case. The performance of the GD workflow was assessed through the time required for design and the basic properties of the GD PSIs. The hands-on time for the design was 94 min for the Le Fort I fixation plate and 45 min for the genioplasty plate. The maximum von Mises stress was 227.63 MPa for the Le Fort I fixation plate and 237.31 MPa for the genioplasty fixation plate. The GD-based workflow simplified and accelerated the design of PSIs for orthognathic surgery. Biomechanical analysis indicated the feasibility of generative designed patient-specific implants for clinical practice.}

To ensure a stable competitive and economical production, the steps involved in manual assembly must be optimized. In today’s digital era, Artificial Intelligences (AI) offer innovative approaches and opportunities to streamline processes. In addition to LLM AIs, AI image generators are currently attracting a lot of attention as they generate very realistic and detailed images based on a given description. Images or visualisations of the situation are often used to make work instructions in manual assembly easier to understand. AI image generators can be used to visualise assembly process steps for automatically generated work instructions. In this research, a quantitative measure is proposed that can be used to rate how correctly the actual situation is depicted by highlighting incorrect or false objects and operations and assessing the accuracy of the context. The measure is validated by qualitatively evaluating images created with DALL-E 3 in an user study by both workers and planning experts from industry and comparing them with the quantitative measure. This will enable further research in the field of automated work planning and the comparison of different AI image generation tools for use in assembly planning.}

This study examines the impact of global supply chain pressure on Chinese business and consumer confidence from February 2000 to September 2024. It employs Quantile-on-quantile (QQ) regression, which helps to understand how varying levels of global supply chain pressure influence different levels of Chinese business and consumer confidence, providing insights beyond what can be gauged via a mean-based regression. The main results show the following: Firstly, Chinese business confidence is negatively associated with supply chain pressure across all upper, middle, and lower quantiles, reflecting a homogenous adverse impact irrespective of the levels of both variables. Secondly, Chinese consumer confidence is impacted heterogeneously by the magnitude of supply chain pressure, indicating the relevance of the quantile distribution of both variables to their association. The results remain valid after applying a Wavelet Quantile Correlation approach, indicating their robustness. Our findings offer crucial insights to Chinese policymakers and other stakeholders, suggesting that Chinese businesses do not tolerate pressure in the global supply chain, whereas Chinese consumers tend to switch to local products and services during lapses in the global supply chain.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Guidelines recommend endoscopic detorsion in cases of sigmoid volvulus without ischemia or perforation, but the timing in which this should be performed is unclear.
Methods
Admissions for sigmoid volvulus in which endoscopic detorsion was performed between January 2010 and April 2024 were retrospectively reviewed. The timing was calculated as the time between when the confirmatory radiologic examination and endoscopic detorsion were performed. The timing was compared with various patient outcomes.
Results
One hundred eighteen episodes of sigmoid volvulus from 73 unique adult patients were included (mean age, 69.0 years; 76.3% men). The median time until endoscopic detorsion was 225.5 minutes (IQR, 144.5-478.3) with 81 procedures (68.6%) performed in <6 hours. The timing of detorsion was not associated with the presence of ischemia (P = .289) or a combination of serious outcomes (P = .777). Those who underwent delayed endoscopic detorsion (>6 hours) were more likely to be younger (62.4 vs 67.4, P = .034) and to have had a rectal tube placed (59.5% vs 21.0%, P < .001). Delayed cases were associated with a longer length of admission (5.0 vs 3.0 days, P = .011); however, other outcomes such as the success of endoscopic detorsion, presence of ischemia, readmission rate, and mortality rate showed no difference between the groups. In a multivariate regression analysis, serious outcomes were associated with on-call status (P = .045) but not the timing of detorsion (P = .404).
Conclusions
There does not appear to be a clear correlation between a longer delay until endoscopic detorsion and worse patient outcomes, with only the length of hospitalization affected. This suggests that endoscopic detorsion does not need to always be performed urgently.}

The second experiment required the AI tools to design a headphone holder stand from scratch, further assessing their capabilities in CAD, but also their abilities in product design. The experiments found that these technologies show great potential in the area of engineering design.

Results indicate that LLMs generally use a narrower and more repetitive range of stance and engagement features than human writers, with significant variation also across each LLM. Disciplinary use of stance and engagement is largely in line with human writing except for the philosophy discipline. Implications for teaching academic writing are discussed, particularly regarding identifying potential LLM-related plagiarism and inconsistencies in academic stance and engagement.}

According to this theory, a human can claim authorship when they are guided by artistic imagery thinking and manifest individual creativity throughout the entire creation process from conception to execution. In the HAIC model, the unpredictable nature of the AI black box does not impede the recognition of users’ control, as users possess the capability for artistic imagery thinking to direct the entire creation process. If their contribution meets the originality standard, they qualify as the author of the AIGC. Current prevailing views that evaluate AIGC’s originality on the basis of either the final form of expression or the users’ prompts in the initial stage overlook the dynamic nature of the creative process.}

abstract = {Introduction
The effect of gender on teaching satisfaction in clinical medicine has been mixed. While earlier studies often reported that female physician educators receive lower evaluation scores than their male counterparts, particularly in traditionally male-dominated fields such as surgery, more recent evidence suggests a shift, with female faculty receiving comparable or even higher ratings. We hypothesised that female faculty in Orthopaedic surgery, a predominantly male specialty, would receive lower teaching satisfaction scores due to potential biases arising from the male-dominated nature of the field and societal norms.
Methods
A retrospective review of an electronically administered post-lesson teaching evaluation from students from two undergraduate and one postgraduate medical school in the field of Orthopaedic surgery. Evaluations were based on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 on “overall satisfaction” and “educational relevance”. Free text feedback for the educators were also obtained. The data was collected over a three-year period (Academic Years 2021–2024).
Results
A total of 3358 student evaluations from 653 teaching sessions were identified. Male faculty delivered 602 teaching sessions with 3110 evaluations. Female faculty delivered 51 teaching sessions with 248 evaluations. A total of 44 male surgeons and 4 female surgeons were involved in education. Female faculty received higher mean satisfaction scores (4.87 ± 0.24) compared to males (4.73 ± 0.47) (p = 0.035). Relevance scores were not significantly different (female 4.87 ± 0.27, male 4.79 ± 0.38, p = 0.16). “Clear” and “engaging” were the top two most frequently used adjectives to describe the teaching characteristics for both genders. The third-ranked adjective was “interactive” for males and “helpful”, “encouraging”, and “interactive” for females in a three-way tie.
Conclusions
Female Orthopaedic faculty achieved higher teaching satisfaction scores compared to male counterparts, dispelling possible negative gender stereotypes in both the male-dominated field and within the broader Southeast Asian social context.}

abstract = {This study aims to analyze the integration of the principles of positive psychology (PP) in terms of a multidimensional approach to the well-being of students receiving vocational education. The study involved undergraduate students in the full-time program. They were randomly divided into an Intervention group (n = 123) and a Control group (n = 124). Both groups studied according to the same curriculum. The difference between the groups was that the Intervention group's daily lectures and practical classes integrated the PP principles. This group also participated in additional training on PP. The study assessed the well-being and motivation of the students before and after the intervention for both groups. The researchers confirmed that the integration of PP principles contributes to the well-being of students. There was a strong connection between the variables of positive well-being and motivation (Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation). Gender was the only socio-demographic factor that influenced the well-being of students during the PP interventions. Teachers and educational administrators may adapt the presented approaches to their specific objectives and tasks, taking into account the needs and characteristics of their students.}

abstract = {Generative AI (genAI) tools have involved rapid and broad uptake since their wide release in late 2022, including among teachers. We investigated several factors that play a role in teachers’ motivation and engagement to harness genAI in teaching and learning. We examined contextual factors (in-school support to apply genAI, time pressure, disruptive student behavior) as predictors of motivation (genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing) and, in turn, engagement (i.e., genAI integration in teaching-related work and student learning activities) over the course of one school term. Among 368 Australian primary and secondary school teachers, our findings revealed that genAI support was associated with greater genAI self-efficacy and genAI valuing. Time pressure was also linked with greater genAI valuing, whereas disruptive student behavior was not linked with the genAI motivation or engagement variables. In turn, genAI self-efficacy was linked with greater levels of both types of genAI integration. GenAI valuing was associated with greater genAI integration in teaching-related work only. Our results provide knowledge about factors relevant for supporting genAI and its application among teachers in Australia—and also hold relevance to teachers in other countries.}

abstract = {Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) imaging is a non-invasive quantitative detection technique that locates and quantifies fluorescent molecular probes in biological tissue. However, due to the light scattering effect and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, it is difficult to accurately reconstruct the fluorescence distribution. Traditional iterative reconstruction methods rely on the selection of regularization parameters, and data-driven deep learning methods have insufficient interpretability. In order to improve the imaging quality, fluorescence molecular tomography via score-based generative model (FTSG) is proposed. Prior information about the fluorescence target distribution is extracted via score-based generative model, which is used as a regularization term constraint for an iterative process based on the physical model. FTSG is validated through simulations and experiments using fluorescent targets with different radii and edge-to-edge distances. Compared with traditional methods, FTSG offers better resolution and reconstruction quality. This method can effectively distinguish two fluorescent targets with an edge-to-edge distance of 1 mm.}

abstract = {Background
Through third party applications, patients in the United States have access to their electronic health record (EHR) data from multiple health care providers. However, these applications offer only a predefined organization of these records by type, time stamp, or provider, leaving out meaningful connections between them. This prevents patients from efficiently reviewing, exploring, and making sense of their EHR data based on current or ongoing health issues. The lack of personalized organization and important connections can limit patients’ ability to use their data and make informed health decisions.
Objective
To address these challenges, we created Discovery, an experimental app that enables patients to organize their medical records into collections, analogous to placing pictures in photo albums. These collections are based on the evolving understanding of the patients’ past and ongoing health issues. The app also allows patients to add text notes to collections and their constituent records. By observing how patients used features to select records and assemble them into collections, our goal was to learn about their preferred mechanisms to complete these tasks and the challenges they would face in the wild. We also intended to become more informed about the various ways in which patients could and would like to use collections.
Methods
We conducted a think-aloud evaluation study with 14 participants on synthetic data. In session 1, we obtained feedback on the mechanics for creating and assembling collections and adding notes. In session 2, we focused on reviewing collections, finding data patterns within them, and retaining insights, as well as exploring use cases. We conducted reflexive thematic analysis on the transcribed feedback.
Results
Collections were useful for personal use (quick access to information, reflection on medical history, tracking health, journaling, and learning from past experiences) and clinical visits (preparation and raising physicians’ awareness). Assembling EHR data into reliable collections could be difficult for typical patients due to considerable manual work and lack of medical knowledge. However, automated collection building could alleviate this issue. Furthermore, having EHR data organized in collections may have limited use. However, augmenting them with patient-generated data, which are entered with flexible richness and structure, could add context, elevate meaning, and improve actionability. Finally, collections might produce a misconstrued health picture, but bringing the physician in the loop for verification could increase their clinical validity.
Conclusions
Collections can be a powerful tool for advancing patients’ proactivity, awareness, and self-advocacy, potentially facilitating patient-centered care. However, patients need better support for incorporating their own everyday data and adding meaningful annotations for future reference. Improvements in the comprehensiveness, efficiency, and reliability of the collection assembly process through automation are also necessary.}

In this study, to explore the structural mechanics mechanism, virtual models are performed based on the physical data of the soil and structure, and are compared to the on-site photos of the same scenarios. The basic mechanics is inspected by three Generative AI models in 73 tests to explore the mechanisms by text outputs. The physical-based simplified mechanics models are calculated on the first two supports scenarios to offer some guides and knowledge to the following data mining work. The structural physical mechanics is also numerical simulated to offer some further physical guides. The structure monitoring data of the support axial force and the diaphragm wall deformation in the deep excavation is explored with the time and excavating depths varying, and the relationship of the dual heterogeneous mechanics performance are qualitative discussed by a three-dimension demonstration method. Furthermore, a novel index, the ratio of the force to the deformation, is proposed on the data-driven sight. The relationship is calculated quantitatively on the proposed index in different construction stages, and the probability distribution is inspected. In summary, three physical-based models are performed and investigated to offer physical guides for data-driven dual heterogeneous mechanics mechanism on an underground excavation case in Metro construction, and the qualitative and quantitative exploring are performed based on the three-dimension data demonstrations and on a proposed index. The mechanism exploring methods can be synthetical integrated for the future engineering expert systems in engineering, and for the coming intelligence construction.}

As novel technologies arise or existing ones further develop, it becomes increasingly challenging to balance leveraging these advancements and safeguarding personal data. By relying on firsthand accounts of professionals in the field, the paper identifies how these challenges, which appear to be applicable to data controllers and Data Protection Authorities, are substantially connected with ensuring a sound interpretation of the law through time. The paper examines the leading foresight and anticipation techniques and explores their possible data protection applications by reviewing existing initiatives that attempt to implement foresight in the context of data protection. Section 2 delves into the evolving regulatory landscape, emphasising the need for a foresight-based approach to tackle the complexities arising from data-intensive technologies and the changing European regulatory framework. Section 3 introduces foresight as a discipline, its history and evolution, and leading techniques. Section 4 presents practical examples of foresight in data protection, detailing initiatives by the authors and other actors in the data protection space. In conclusion, the paper underscores the initial consensus on the benefits of anticipatory approaches in addressing current data protection challenges. Anticipation techniques, as a flexible concept, can be tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders, fostering a collaborative and practical approach to data protection. However, a gap in consolidated methodologies persists, necessitating further research to design and implement practical foresight approaches.}

A new operator is introduced that weights these comments to calculate preference relations. Furthermore, modification of the relationships is allowed if the experts so wish. Moreover, another operator is incorporated that adjusts the weight of each expert according to his or her active participation in the discussion, assigning more weight to those who contribute more comments. Finally, this innovative method promotes coherence and equal participation in group decision-making by employing an innovative sentiment analysis detection system.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) is used increasingly in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). However, the true role, utility, advantages, and limitations of AI tools in POCUS have been poorly understood.
Aim
to conduct a scoping review on the current literature of AI in POCUS to identify (1) how AI is being applied in POCUS, and (2) how AI in POCUS could be utilized in clinical settings.
Methods
The review followed the JBI scoping review methodology. A search strategy was conducted in Medline, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and AI POCUS manufacturer websites. Selection criteria, evidence screening, and selection were performed in Covidence. Data extraction and analysis were performed on Microsoft Excel by the primary investigator and confirmed by the secondary investigators.
Results
Thirty-three papers were included. AI POCUS on the cardiopulmonary region was the most prominent in the literature. AI was most frequently used to automatically measure biometry using POCUS images. AI POCUS was most used in acute settings. However, novel applications in non-acute and low-resource settings were also explored. AI had the potential to increase POCUS accessibility and usability, expedited care and management, and had a reasonably high diagnostic accuracy in limited applications such as measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Inferior Vena Cava Collapsibility Index, Left-Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral and identifying B-lines of the lung. However, AI could not interpret poor images, underperformed compared to standard-of-care diagnostic methods, and was less effective in patients with specific disease states, such as severe illnesses that limit POCUS image acquisition.
Conclusion
This review uncovered the applications of AI in POCUS and the advantages and limitations of AI POCUS in different clinical settings. Future research in the field must first establish the diagnostic accuracy of AI POCUS tools and explore their clinical utility through clinical trials.}

abstract = {Background
Patients find technology tools to be more approachable for seeking sensitive health-related information, such as reproductive health information. The inventive conversational ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT (OpenAI Inc), offers a potential means for patients to effectively locate answers to their health-related questions digitally.
Objective
A pilot study was conducted to compare the novel ChatGPT with the existing Google Search technology for their ability to offer accurate, effective, and current information regarding proceeding action after missing a dose of oral contraceptive pill.
Methods
A sequence of 11 questions, mimicking a patient inquiring about the action to take after missing a dose of an oral contraceptive pill, were input into ChatGPT as a cascade, given the conversational ability of ChatGPT. The questions were input into 4 different ChatGPT accounts, with the account holders being of various demographics, to evaluate potential differences and biases in the responses given to different account holders. The leading question, “what should I do if I missed a day of my oral contraception birth control?” alone was then input into Google Search, given its nonconversational nature. The results from the ChatGPT questions and the Google Search results for the leading question were evaluated on their readability, accuracy, and effective delivery of information.
Results
The ChatGPT results were determined to be at an overall higher-grade reading level, with a longer reading duration, less accurate, less current, and with a less effective delivery of information. In contrast, the Google Search resulting answer box and snippets were at a lower-grade reading level, shorter reading duration, more current, able to reference the origin of the information (transparent), and provided the information in various formats in addition to text.
Conclusions
ChatGPT has room for improvement in accuracy, transparency, recency, and reliability before it can equitably be implemented into health care information delivery and provide the potential benefits it poses. However, AI may be used as a tool for providers to educate their patients in preferred, creative, and efficient ways, such as using AI to generate accessible short educational videos from health care provider-vetted information. Larger studies representing a diverse group of users are needed.}

The paper further extends with a detailed literature review regarding the various applications of generative AI in talent management: talent identification, recruitment, training, and performance appraisal. It also considers many benefits related to implementing GAI for talent management, such as improvisation of work efficiency, personalization of employee experiences, and data-driven decision-making. In this regard, the review indicates some of the complex challenges like ethical issues, biases in algorithmic decision-making, privacy concerns, and the need to upskill HR professionals that come as a result of implementing GAI. It does so by showing current opportunities opened up for organizations that adopt GAI to optimize their talent management processes, increase employee engagement, and boost retention rates in a fast-changing digital landscape.}

abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis, characterized by non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, is a multisystem disease with an unpredictable disease spectrum. An estimated 5% of sarcoidosis patients have clinically evident cardiac involvement while 25% may have asymptomatic silent disease leading to challenging diagnosis.
Objectives:
We aim to study the clinical characteristics in a cohort of cardiac sarcoidosis patients to identify patterns of cardiac involvement and clinical correlations.
Methods:
We conducted a single center retrospective study of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis at Mayo Clinic Florida. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB). Inclusion criteria was patients older than 18 years of age, with diagnosis of sarcoid myocarditis/cardiac sarcoidosis/sarcoid heart muscle disease specified ICD-10 code D86.85 with established visits using specified CPT codes between 02/25/2018 till 08/24/2023. A list of 99 patients was generated and 76 patients met above criteria. Subsequently data from each patient was collected that included baseline demographics and disease characteristics.
Results:
Table 1 provides patient demographics. 44 (57.9%) patients were male and 32 (42.1 %) were female with 59 (77.6%) Caucasian and 14 (18.4%) African American. There were 7 deaths (9.2% mortality) with 1 from cardiogenic shock, 1 cardiopulmonary arrest and 1 attributed to side effects of immunosuppressive therapy. 13 (17.1%) patients had a positive exposure history to chemicals and toxins. Only 6 (17.6%) patients had an abnormal angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level. Non-necrotizing granulomas noted on pathology in 19 (25.0%) patients and 54 (71.1%) had negative biopsy. Tissue sampled included lung 15 (19.7%), lymph node 19 (25.0%) and cardiac 10 (13.2%). 49 (64.5%) patients had cardiomyopathy with dilated being the most common and heart failure reduced ejection fraction (EF) the predominant type (N=28[41.8%]). 27 (35.5%) patients had abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular (AV) blocks the most frequent rhythm abnormalities. Cardiac MRI was performed in 60 cases and 55 (91.7%) had late gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (PET) was performed in 47 cases and was positive in 42 (89.4%) cases. 69 (90.8%) patients achieved remission while relapsing disease was an unfortunate occurrence in 36 (47.4%) cases [Figure 1].
Conclusion:
Development of a standardized diagnostic algorithm and classification criteria for cardiac sarcoidosis is imperative. Our cohort recorded a high mortality and relapse rate and surveillance for cardiac involvement must be undertaken in all patients with sarcoidosis. Certain occupational exposures were identified and prompts raising awareness for environmental safety. Figure 1Relapse probability over time (months)
