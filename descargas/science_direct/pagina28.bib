abstract = {The proposed paper presents a methodology for mapping electronic manufacturing control processes within a Knowledge Management (KM) framework, aligning with human-centric and transdisciplinary approaches. Specifically, the paper explores a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) process for tuning production machinery, facilitating quality management and predictive maintenance through an AI-driven model. The PID circuit model is designed using the LTspice tool, while the entire production workflow is structured according to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. The model incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize machine control, establishing an advanced Digital Twin (DT) model that enables interactive human-system collaboration. The work further describes Knowledge Base (KB) data sources that support KM within Industry 5.0 environments, emphasizing AI-enhanced, user-centered control systems. Finally, the paper discusses new managerial roles and skill sets necessary for overseeing these integrated, human-centric KM systems in next-generation industrial applications.}

Current treatment options, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted drugs, have limitations, such as significant side effects, drug resistance, and high cost. To overcome these challenges, extensive studies have explored the anticancer potential of various drugs such as clotrimazole (CLZ), which has shown promising anticancer effects. CLZ was first developed as an antifungal agent. Recently significant anticancer effects have been observed making it a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. Compared with other azole-based antifungals, CLZ has shown distinct therapeutic effects on cancer cells via several pathways. Its ability to disrupt glycolysis by inhibiting phosphofructokinase (PFK) and hexokinase (HK) distinguishes it from other azoles. Furthermore, CLZ obstructs calcium homeostasis and critical survival pathways, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-p65, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, inhibiting tumor growth, inducing apoptosis, and attenuating metastasis. This review explores the potential of repurposing CLZ in cancer and its well-established safety profile and cost-effectiveness to highlight current treatment gaps. It briefly examines in vitro and in vivo assessments to understand the mechanisms and effects of CLZ on various cancer types. Furthermore, novel strategies such as nanoformulations and combination therapies with existing chemotherapeutic drugs have been highlighted to improve therapeutic outcomes. Preclinical studies have provided promising evidence for the efficacy of CLZ in different cancers, showing tumor regression and improved responses to conventional chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Given its evident preclinical results and diverse mechanisms of action, CLZ may be considered an antineoplastic agent. Further clinical research is required to fully elucidate its anticancer potential, potentially positing it as a valuable addition to currently available cancer treatments.}

Statement of problem
Different instruments have been used to measure the marginal gaps of crowns in vitro. However, a comprehensive systematic review is lacking.
Purpose
The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing literature on the instruments used for the in vitro marginal gap measurement of ceramic single crowns before cementation and to determine whether the crown material and method of fabrication influenced the marginal gap.
Material and methods
The search was conducted in 2024 across the EBSCO Host, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and predefined eligibility criteria. Eligible articles were screened to evaluate 6 instruments for measuring crown marginal gaps: direct view microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, impression replica, cross-sectioning, microcomputed tomography, and 3-dimensional (3D) superimposition. The normality of the data was assessed by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the differences in mean marginal gap were statistically evaluated using the Welch ANOVA (α=.05).
Results
Ninety-two articles were included, with 77 documenting single measurement instruments and 15 using a combination of 2 or more measurement instruments. Direct view microscopy was the most used instrument and appeared in 31 (40%) of the studies. No significant differences in mean marginal gap (F=2.09, P=.077) were found across the 6 measurement instruments. Across all studies, excluding those using 3D superimposition, the mean ±standard deviation number of marginal gap measurements per crown was 34.3 ±50.6. Among the 77 studies using a single measurement instrument, 64 used computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) technology to fabricate the crowns. CAD-CAM crowns had a mean ±standard deviation marginal gap of 78.9 ±28.6 µm (n=64) compared with 71.6 ±29.5 µm (n=13) for crowns manufactured using conventional methods. Zirconia and lithium disilicate were the most researched materials. Zirconia crowns recorded a mean ±standard deviation marginal gap of 69.4 ±34.2 µm for 972 crowns, which was significantly different (P=.045) from lithium disilicate with a mean ±standard deviation marginal gap of 92.2 ±42.5 µm for 602 crowns.
Conclusions
Direct view microscopy was the most used marginal gap measurement instrument for ceramic single crowns before cementation, and CAD-CAM was the most used crown fabrication method. No significant differences in mean marginal gap were found among the 6 marginal gap measurement instruments.}

The cross-sectional survey included validated measures of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, stress, environmental stressors, resource loss, and demographics. The results indicated significantly higher levels of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress in residents of high-vulnerability areas compared to moderate or low-vulnerability regions. Resource loss served as a mediating variable between environmental stressors and mental health outcomes. Furthermore, demographic analyses showed that older adults and women reported higher levels of psychological distress.

Further the antimicrobial resistance profile of E. coli and Vibrio species isolated from these samples were also tested. A very high number (more than three thousand gene copies per gram of plastic litter) of Escherichia coli, and Vibrio spp. were detected in the plastic litter. Vibrio spp. in the plastic litter were identified as V. harveyi, V. neocaledonicus, V. japonicus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. campbelli. More than sixty percentage of E. coli and Vibrio spp. isolated from all samples except the E. coli isolated from fishing gear of Kavaratti had multiple antibiotic resistance index of more than 0.25. Most of the bacteria were resistant towards ampicillin, erythromycin, and moxifloxacin, while least resistance was observed against gatifloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, norfloxacin and trimethoprim. These results indicate that plastic litter may act as a conduit for the attachment and transport of multiple antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing severe setbacks to the global efforts on attaining sustainable development goals 3 (health), 6 (clean water) and 14 (life under water). Therefore, strict implementation of plastic waste management rules, awareness campaigns for cleaning beaches and citizen science initiatives to monitor and remove plastics are proposed for protecting the beaches from the deleterious effects of mismanaged plastics.}

This meta-analysis quantitatively synthesized data from 12 functional neuroimaging studies, including 390 TLE patients and 356 healthy controls (age range: 8.1–70 years; 57.2 % female), to identify language-related brain alterations in TLE. Compared to healthy controls, TLE patients exhibited hypoactivity within the left frontal language regions, including Broca’s area, precentral gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus, suggesting language impairment across syntactic, semantic, and articulatory processes. In parallel, hyperactivity in right-hemisphere regions was observed, reflecting compensatory neuroplastic adaptations to left-hemisphere language dysfunction. This reorganization may partially preserve language function but also indicate language processing inefficiencies. Moderator analyses revealed that in TLE, language comprehension compared with vocabulary elicited occipital hyperactivity and inferior frontal hypoactivity, reflecting posterior compensation and reduced frontal control. Left-sided TLE, compared to right-sided TLE, was more associated with hypoactivity in Broca’s area, reflecting the heightened vulnerability of the language-dominant frontotemporal regions. Greater hyperactivity in the right superior temporal gyrus with longer TLE duration may imply sustained compensatory engagement, whereas diminished hyperactivity in the right hippocampal gyrus with TLE duration may indicate a decline in compensatory capacity due to epileptic disruption. Furthermore, the more severity of language impairment correlated with (1) hypoactivity in Broca’s area, suggesting its role as a neural marker of language dysfunction, and (2) hyperactivity in the left insula, representing neural inefficiency or maladaptive neuroplastic reorganization. Collectively, these findings emphasize the complex interactions between epileptic pathology, compensatory reorganization, and progressive neuroplastic adaptation in shaping language outcomes in TLE.}

abstract = {Background
The burden caused by the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems continues to be an important issue for health care organizations, especially given human resource shortages in health care systems globally. As physicians report spending 2 hours documenting for every hour of patient care, there has been strong interest from many organizations to understand and address the root causes of physician burnout due to EHR burden.
Objective
This study focuses on evaluating physician burnout related to EHR usage and the impact of a physician engagement strategy at a Canadian mental health organization 5 years after implementation.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess the perceived impact of the physician engagement strategy on burnout associated with EHR use. Physicians were invited to participate in a web-based survey that included the Mini-Z Burnout questionnaire, along with questions about their perceptions of the EHR and the effectiveness of the initiatives within the physician engagement strategy. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the quantitative data, while thematic analysis was used for the qualitative data.
Results
Of the 254 physicians invited, 128 completed the survey, resulting in a 50% response rate. Among the respondents, 26% (33/128) met the criteria for burnout according to the Mini-Z questionnaire, with 61% (20/33) of these attributing their burnout to EHR use. About 52% of participants indicated that the EHR improves communication (67/128) and 38% agreed that the EHR enables high-quality care (49/128). Regarding the physician engagement strategy initiatives, 39% (50/128) agreed that communication through the strategy is efficient, and 75% (96/128) felt more proficient in using the EHR. However, additional areas for improvement within the EHR were identified, including (1) medication reconciliation and prescription processes; (2) chart navigation and information retrieval; (3) longitudinal medication history; and (4) technology infrastructure challenges.
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential impact of EHRs on physician burnout and the effectiveness of a unique physician engagement strategy in fostering positive perceptions and improving EHR usability among physicians. By evaluating this initiative in a real-world setting, the study contributes to the broader literature on strategies aimed at enhancing physician experience following large-scale EHR implementation. However, the findings indicate a continued need for system-level improvements to maximize the value and usage of EHRs. The physician engagement strategy demonstrates the potential to enhance physicians’ EHR experience. Future efforts should prioritize system-level advancements to increase the EHR’s impact on quality of care and develop standardized approaches for engaging physicians on a broader Canadian scale.}

Next, mouse dams were fed bonito broth during gestation or lactation and licking of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10% corn oil in their adult pups was evaluated in acute tests. Compared to the control group, there were significant decreases in licks for some corn oil concentrations in the gestation and lactation groups. Finally, corn oil licking was tested in pups fed bonito broth after weaning. No significant effect was detected.

The inclusion of fluorescence, UV–vis absorption, molecular docking, and dynamics simulation techniques employed to broadly investigate the combination of APR with BSA at typical physiological conditions. The thermodynamic results revealed that enthalpy (ΔH0) and entropy (ΔS0) changes were computed as +11.14 kJ mol−1 and +97.56 J mol−1 K−1, respectively, which represented the binding is principally entropy-driven and the hydrophobic forces acting a significant role in the reaction. Analysis of synchronous and 3-D fluorescence signals revealed microenvironmental variations close to BSA’s Trp and Tyr residues upon APR addition.

Despite efforts to control the disease, the emergence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB strains presents a significant challenge to conventional treatment approaches. Addressing this challenge requires the development of novel anti-TB drug molecules. This study employed de novo drug design approaches to explore new EthR ligands and ethionamide boosters targeting the crucial enzyme InhA involved in mycolic acid synthesis in Mtb. Leveraging REINVENT4, a modern open-source generative AI framework, the study utilized various optimization algorithms such as transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and curriculum learning to design small molecules with desired properties. Specifically, focus was placed on molecule optimization using the Mol2Mol option, which offers multinomial sampling with beam search. The study's findings highlight the identification of six promising compounds exhibiting enhanced activity and improved physicochemical properties through structure-based drug design and optimization efforts. These compounds offer potential candidates for further preclinical and clinical development as novel therapeutics for TB treatment, providing new avenues for combating drug-resistant TB strains and improving patient outcomes.}

This study has investigated how drivers from the general population are willing to share their driving with persons with disabilities. In order to obtain a clearer image, three groups of disability types were considered: persons with physical disabilities, hearing impairments, and visual impairments. The research was performed on 1,064 valid drivers (42.9% females) in Serbia. The most attractive category of persons with disabilities with whom drivers were willing to share their ride was persons with hearing impairments. We identified simplicity and altruism as key factors that influenced drivers’ intentions to share rides with persons with disabilities. Better results for persons with hearing impairments could be expected if the focus were on employed females. Highly educated drivers in urban areas could serve as a promising focus group for measures aimed at persons with visual impairments. Finally, we proposed specific measures to support decision-makers in implementing ridesharing solutions for persons with disabilities.}

One potentially helpful resource is audio content, which provides a flexible and accessible supplement to traditional educational materials. While audio content, such as podcasts, is widely popular, its effect on academic achievement remains underexplored. This pre-registered randomized controlled trial investigated the impact of AI-assisted audio-learning modules on academic achievement, with a particular focus on the mediating roles of motivation and reading engagement. Results showed that the audio-learning modules increased student motivation and reading engagement. Importantly, audio-learning driven increases in motivation and reading engagement boosted academic achievement. Furthermore, students with greater ADHD symptom severity particularly benefited from the audio-learning modules, as they played a crucial role in determining course success.

abstract = {Objectives
Diagnosis and management of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bloodstream infections are often based on positive blood culture results. This retrospective cohort study aimed to develop a classification model using data-driven characterisation to optimise the management of intensive care patients with blood cultures.
Setting, methodology/design
An unsupervised clustering model was developed based on the clinical characteristics of patients with blood cultures in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database (n = 2451). It was tested using the data from the MIMIC-III database (n = 2047).
Main outcome measures
The prognosis, blood culture outcomes, antimicrobial interventions, and trajectories of infection indicators were compared between clusters.
Results
Four clusters were identified using machine learning-based k-means clustering based on data obtained 48 h before the first blood culture sampling. Cluster γ was associated with the highest 28-day mortality rate, followed by clusters α, δ, and β. Cluster γ had a higher fungal isolation rate than cluster β (P < 0.05). Cluster δ was associated with a higher isolation rate of Gram-negative organisms and fungi (P < 0.05). Patients in clusters γ and δ underwent more femoral site vein catheter placements than those in cluster β (P < 0.001, all). Patients with a duration of antibiotics treatment of 4, 6, and 7 days in clusters α, δ, and γ, respectively, had the lowest 28-day mortality rate.
Conclusions
Machine learning identified four clusters of intensive care patients with blood cultures, which yielded different prognoses, blood culture outcomes, and optimal duration of antibiotic treatment. Such data-driven blood culture classifications suggest further investigation should be undertaken to optimise treatment and improve care.
Implications for clinical practice
Intensive care unit-acquired bloodstream infections are heterogeneous. Meaningful classifications associated with outcomes should be described. Using machine learning and cluster analysis could help in understanding heterogeneity. Data-driven blood culture classification could identify distinct physiological states and prognoses before deciding on blood culture sampling, optimise treatment, and improve care.}

Existing safety analysis approaches often focus on the design phase from a process lifecycle perspective. This work therefore also proposes a multi-perspective approach to safety analysis. The approach combines the hierarchy of controls perspective with the automation pyramid, and the digital twin concepts. This approach is applied and discussed in a case study of a retrofitted heat recovery system in an ammonia refrigeration plant.}

However, acquiring data from battery packs is difficult, and experimental data collection requires substantial time and energy. Thus, the challenge of efficiently and accurately obtaining battery pack data is a pressing issue in the development of Battery Management Systems (BMS). This paper presents a simulation method for battery packs based on real cell cloning, demonstrating the effectiveness of using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate cell data reflecting actual charging states. This approach addresses the challenge of temporal data generation for battery packs through image-generating adversarial techniques. Initially, we employ the Pix2Pix GAN to generate battery pack data, followed by fitting the data of cells within the pack using a first-order Gaussian function. The results indicate that our model achieves a sampling point generation error of less than 1 V for the battery pack and less than 5 mV for cells. This advancement can significantly aid researchers in acquiring more effective battery pack data for developing various algorithms and software for BMS functionality testing in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environments.}

abstract = {Lipophilic compounds have a variety of positive effects on human physiological functions and exhibit good effects in the prevention and treatment of clinical diseases. This has led to significant interest in the technical applications of synthetic biology for the production of lipophilic compounds. However, the strict selective permeability of the cell membrane and the hydrophobic nature of lipophilic compounds pose significant challenges to their production. During fermentation, lipophilic compounds tend to accumulate within cell membrane compartments rather than being secreted extracellularly. The toxic effects of excessive lipophilic compound accumulation can threaten cell viability, while the limited space within the cell membrane restricts further increases in production yield. Consequently, to achieve efficient production of lipophilic compounds, research is increasingly focused on constructing robust and multifunctional microbial cell factories. Utilizing membrane engineering techniques to construct highly flexible cell membranes is considered an effective strategy to break through the upper limit of lipophilic compound production. Currently, there are two main approaches to cell membrane modification: constructing artificial storage compartments for lipophilic compounds and engineering the cell membrane structure to facilitate product outflow. This review summarizes recent cell membrane engineering strategies applied in microbial cell factories for the production of liposoluble compounds, discussing the challenges and future prospects. These strategies enhance membrane flexibility and effectively promote the production of liposoluble compounds.}

abstract = {Objective
Health care providers and recipients have been using artificial intelligence and its subfields, such as natural language processing and machine learning technologies, in the form of search engines to obtain medical information for some time now. Although a search engine returns a ranked list of webpages in response to a query and allows the user to obtain information from those links directly, ChatGPT has elevated the interface between humans with artificial intelligence by attempting to provide relevant information in a human-like textual conversation. This technology is being adopted rapidly and has enormous potential to impact various aspects of health care, including patient education, research, scientific writing, pre-visit/post-visit queries, documentation assistance, and more. The objective of this study is to assess whether chatbots could assist with answering patient questions and electronic health record inbox management.
Methods
We devised two questionnaires: (1) administrative and non-complex medical questions (based on actual inbox questions); and (2) complex medical questions on the topic of chronic venous disease. We graded the performance of publicly available chatbots regarding their potential to assist with electronic health record inbox management. The study was graded by an internist and a vascular medicine specialist independently.
Results
On administrative and non-complex medical questions, ChatGPT 4.0 performed better than ChatGPT 3.5. ChatGPT 4.0 received a grade of 1 on all the questions: 20 of 20 (100%). ChatGPT 3.5 received a grade of 1 on 14 of 20 questions (70%), grade 2 on 4 of 16 questions (20%), grade 3 on 0 questions (0%), and grade 4 on 2/20 questions (10%). On complex medical questions, ChatGPT 4.0 performed the best. ChatGPT 4.0 received a grade of 1 on 15 of 20 questions (75%), grade 2 on 2 of 20 questions (10%), grade 3 on 2 of 20 questions (10%), and grade 4 on 1 of 20 questions (5%). ChatGPT 3.5 received a grade of 1 on 9 of 20 questions (45%), grade 2 on 4 of 20 questions (20%), grade 3 on 4 of 20 questions (20%), and grade 4 on 3 of 20 questions (15%). Clinical Camel received a grade of 1 on 0 of 20 questions (0%), grade 2 on 5 of 20 questions (25%), grade 3 on 5 of 20 questions (25%), and grade 4 on 10 of 20 questions (50%).
Conclusions
Based on our interactions with ChatGPT regarding the topic of chronic venous disease, it is plausible that in the future, this technology may be used to assist with electronic health record inbox management and offload medical staff. However, for this technology to receive regulatory approval to be used for that purpose, it will require extensive supervised training by subject experts, have guardrails to prevent “hallucinations” and maintain confidentiality, and prove that it can perform at a level comparable to (if not better than) humans.}

However, the current CPP rational design process is limited, as it requires several rounds of peptide synthesis, prediction and wet-lab validation, which is expensive, time-consuming and requires extensive knowledge in peptide chemistry. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising alternative which can augment the design process, for example by determining physiochemical characteristics, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, disorder and flexibility, as well as predicting in vivo behaviour such as toxicity and peptidase degradation. Other more recent tools utilise supervised machine learning (ML) to predict the penetrative ability of an amino acid sequence. The use of AI in the CPP design process has the potential to reduce development costs and increase the chances of success with respect to delivery. This review provides a survey of in silico tools and AI platforms which can be utilised in the design process, and the key features that should be taken into consideration when designing next generation CPPs.}

To alleviate these issues, we propose the RegionDiffusion, a novel layout-to-image model that uses an attention block called Region Self-Attention to divide the self-attention operation among visual tokens into several independent regions based on the bounding box of the layout to generate objects accurately in the given locations. Then, we design a pipeline utilizing a series of preprocessing and postprocessing steps to improve the quality of the generated data and then train detectors. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RegionDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art models in layout-to-image generation and our pipeline significantly improves the performance of object detectors in both general domains and specific domains.}

The focused kV x-ray approach was proposed to achieve a restricted target size that is difficult for existing devices. The treatment planning of focused X-ray irradiation requires the dose kernel libraries to produce dose maps. However, the Monte Carlo approach for dose kernel library generation is time- and space-consuming. To optimize spatiotemporal efficiency, we propose a machine learning approach based on 3D implicit neural functions to model focused kV X-ray dose kernels for small animal brain radiation. Based on the rat head phantom model, we define a library spanning a parameter space with proper range and resolution to cover the rat brain size and structure variation. We use the TOPAS-based Monte Carlo simulation for data preparation. Each dose kernel can be characterized by a depth parameter triplet. Implicit neural functions are trained to map spatial coordinates with a depth parameter triplet to their corresponding dose values. We find the periodic activation function of hidden neural layers and coordinate embedding of coordinates are important for accurate modeling. Experimental results show that we compress the training library from 17 GB to only 2.27 MB with high accuracy, and it is also shown to predict dose kernels in the testing dose kernels with an acceleration rate of 50,000 times, which is crucial to study the choice of optimal lens. This work is the first attempt to develop machine-learning techniques for modeling dose kernel libraries for small animal brain radiation.}

Recently, LLMs have become commercialized, allowing the average person to access these incredibly powerful tools. Early adopters focused on LLM use in performing logical tasks, including—but not limited to—generating titles, identifying key words, summarizing text, initial editing of scientific work, improving statistical protocols, and performing statistical analysis. More recently, LLMs have been expanded to clinical practice and academia to perform higher cognitive and creative tasks. LLMs provide personalized assistance in learning, facilitate the management of electronic medical records, and offer valuable insights into clinical decision making in cardiology. They enhance patient education by explaining intricate medical conditions in lay terms, have a vast library of knowledge to help clinicians expedite administrative tasks, provide useful feedback regarding content of scientific writing, and assist in the peer-review process. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not without limitations. They are susceptible to generating incorrect or plagiarized content, face challenges in handling tasks without detailed prompts, and lack originality. These limitations underscore the importance of human oversight in using LLMs in medical science and clinical practice. As LLMs continue to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial in maximizing their potential benefits while mitigating risks. This review explores the functions, opportunities, and constraints of LLMs, with a focus on their impact on cardiology, illustrating both the transformative power and the boundaries of current technology in medicine.
Résumé
Les grands modèles de langage (LLM; large language models) représentent une forme unique d'apprentissage automatique qui facilite la saisie de textes non structurés et/ou d'informations numériques en vue d'une interprétation et d'une prédiction significatives. Récemment, les LLM ont été commercialisés, permettant au commun des mortels d'accéder à ces outils incroyablement puissants. Les premiers utilisateurs se sont concentrés sur l'utilisation des LLM pour effectuer des tâches logiques, y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, la génération de titres, l'identification de mots-clés, le résumé de textes, l'édition initiale de travaux scientifiques, l'amélioration de protocoles statistiques et l'exécution d'analyses statistiques. Plus récemment, les LLM ont été étendus à la pratique clinique et au monde universitaire pour effectuer des tâches cognitives et créatives de haut niveau. Les LLM fournissent une aide personnalisée à l'apprentissage, facilitent la gestion des dossiers médicaux électroniques et offrent des informations précieuses pour la prise de décision clinique en cardiologie. Ils améliorent l'éducation des patients en expliquant des conditions médicales complexes avec des termes simples, disposent d'une vaste bibliothèque de connaissances pour aider les cliniciens à accélérer les tâches administratives, fournissent un retour d'information utile sur le contenu des écrits scientifiques et participent au processus de révision par les pairs. Malgré leurs capacités impressionnantes, les LLM ne sont pas sans limitations. Ils sont susceptibles de générer des contenus incorrects ou plagiés, sont confrontés à des difficultés pour effectuer des tâches sans instructions détaillées et manquent d'originalité. Ces limitations soulignent l'importance de la surveillance humaine dans l'utilisation des LLM en science médicale et dans la pratique clinique. À mesure que les LLM continuent d'évoluer, il sera essentiel de relever ces défis pour maximiser leurs avantages potentiels tout en atténuant les risques. Cette étude explore les fonctions, les opportunités et les contraintes des LLM, en mettant l'accent sur leur impact en cardiologie, illustrant à la fois le pouvoir de transformation et les limites de la technologie actuelle en médecine.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-derived cancer models (PDCMs) have become essential tools in cancer research and preclinical studies. Consequently, the number of publications on PDCMs has increased significantly over the past decade. Advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for extracting knowledge from scientific literature at scale.
Objective
This study aims to investigate LLM-based systems, focusing specifically on prompting techniques for the automated extraction of PDCM-related entities from scientific texts.
Methods
We explore 2 LLM-prompting approaches. The classic method, direct prompting, involves manually designing a prompt. Our direct prompt consists of an instruction, entity-type definitions, gold examples, and a query. In addition, we experiment with a novel and underexplored prompting strategy—soft prompting. Unlike direct prompting, soft prompts are trainable continuous vectors that learn from provided data. We evaluate both prompting approaches across state-of-the-art proprietary and open LLMs.
Results
We manually annotated 100 abstracts of PDCM-relevant papers, focusing on PDCM papers with data deposited in the CancerModels.Org platform. The resulting gold annotations span 15 entity types for a total 3313 entity mentions, which we split across training (2089 entities), development (542 entities) and held-out, eye-off test (682 entities) sets. Evaluation includes the standard metrics of precision or positive predictive value, recall or sensitivity, and F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) in 2 settings: an exact match setting, where spans of gold and predicted annotations have to match exactly, and an overlapping match setting, where the spans of gold and predicted annotations have to overlap. GPT4-o with direct prompting achieved F1-scores of 50.48 and 71.36 for exact and overlapping match settings, respectively. In both evaluation settings, LLaMA3 soft prompting improved performance over direct prompting (F1-score from 7.06 to 46.68 in the exact match setting; and 12.0 to 71.80 in the overlapping evaluation setting). Results with LLaMA3 soft prompting are slightly higher than GPT4-o direct prompting in the overlapping match evaluation setting.
Conclusions
We investigated LLM-prompting techniques for the automatic extraction of PDCM-relevant entities from scientific texts, comparing the traditional direct prompting approach with the emerging soft prompting method. In our experiments, GPT4-o demonstrated strong performance with direct prompting, maintaining competitive results. Meanwhile, soft prompting significantly enhanced the performance of smaller open LLMs. Our findings suggest that training soft prompts on smaller open models can achieve performance levels comparable to those of proprietary very large language models.}

In what follows, I offer a broader reflection on technology that aims to contextualize the novelty and singularity attributed to AI within the history of technological developments. My ultimate goal is to relativize the novelty of AI, seeking to alleviate the moral anxieties it currently elicits and encouraging a more normal, optimistic view of it. The first step in understanding AI is indeed to realize that its novelty is only relative, and that AI has many ancestors that, upon closer examination, turn out to be closely related.}

The findings reveal strong predictive performance of regression models for active material loading, with support vector machine emerging as the top performer. Multiclassification models exhibit satisfactory precision, particularly in categorizing ideal electrode samples. Analysis of principal component and correlation circles highlight viscosity and wet thickness as critical variables for mixing and coating, respectively.

However, the connection between electrolyzers and renewable energy systems requires DC-DC converters with high step-down ratios and low current ripple.

In order to handle this technical point, a novel non-isolated DC-DC converter for hydrogen production is proposed in this paper. It has the advantages of a higher step-down ratio and low voltage stress. Aside from that, the proposal is able to achieve a negligible output current ripple without the additional active power devices or transformers. Finally, the topology is connected to an electrolyzer in the experiment to verify the effectiveness of the topology.}

The purpose of this column is to inform librarians and other information professionals about prompt engineering (PE) and to challenge them to consider how it relates to the work that they are doing and consider if it might enhance their current ability to serve users.
Design/methodology/approach
PE is a new job category in the fields of technology and artificial intelligence. Prompt engineers use various approaches to elicit the best possible outputs from large language module technologies such as ChatGPT. This column examines the various elements present in effective prompts and how the skills, knowledge and abilities relate to the work that librarians already do, where there are disruptions and how the field of library and information science may approach studying the emergence and effectiveness of PE in resolving information needs.
Findings
While PE shares many of the goals, procedures and skillsets that librarians already know and use, it is a disruption in information-seeking processes. It is a highly complex undertaking that requires a mix of knowledge, skills and abilities. If done well, PE will allow information seekers to achieve a whole new level of results both in terms of the information retrieved and the content that is produced based on that information.
Originality/value
Librarians are currently generally not considered to be prime candidates for PE positions. However, this column introduces the idea that many librarians already have the knowledge, skills, abilities and aptitude to do PE. This may be as prompt engineers or by integrating PE into their existing professional practice.}

Generally, CS are the main waste by-products of cocoa production, and their utilization is limited. The coating materials were mainly compounded using melamine (a blowing agent), ammonium polyphosphate (a dehydrating agent), and the same doses of PER, CS or their mixtures (PER/CS). They were primarily investigated using a gas flame-heated furnace (according to a cellulosic fire curve), TGA, and DSC techniques. The CS addition markedly affected charring processes of ICs during the fire test and improved intumescence effectiveness and thermal insulation time parameters (from 15.9 to 23.6 a.u. and from 28.2 to 30.9 min, respectively). Moreover, the natural additive increased compression strength of charred ICs on a steel substrate (from 1.48 to 1.88 kPa). The best performance properties were noted for IC with the PER/CS mixture containing 10 wt% of the organic component – in this case all the tested features were improved.}

Three-component passive seismic data were collected over 30 days at 135 stations spaced approximately 25 km with sample rate of 2 ms and a natural frequency of 5 Hz. Cross-correlation functions of ambient noise were calculated between station pairs to determine dispersion curves at a period bandwidth of 3 to 9 s, from which a shear-wave velocity model was constructed to a depth of 20 km. In the top 5 km, low shear-wave velocity < 3400 m/s correlates with low electrical resistivity <100 Ohm.m from a broadband MT inversion of 134 co-located sites, primarily due to fluid-porosity of sediments. In the depth range 5–20 km there are two notable features. Firstly, across the southern part of the Curnamona Province shear-wave velocity increases by >200 m/s from west to east, over ∼200 km, correlated with a trend in Bouguer gravity that increases from −200 μm/s2 to +200 μm/s2. Secondly, there is weaker correlation in dip and spatial extent between a zone of low resistivity <10 Ohm.m and low shear-wave velocity < 3600 m/s. Higher density crust in the eastern margin of the Curnamona Province may be due to Paleoproterozoic-aged mafic crust that was originally subducted and then upthrust to shallower depths during the Olarian Orogeny from 1620 to 1580 Ma. Reduced shear-wave velocity coincident with low-resistivity in the crust may be related to grain-boundary graphitic Paleoproterozoic sediments that would be ductile with slightly lower shear-modulus and be electrically conductive.}

In this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise, and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23 %. This represents a notable improvement, surpassing the accuracy of some of the state-of-the-art software-based methods for automated microstructure extraction, including neural network with convex hull and approximate contour (UNet + CHAC) (89 %), richer convolutional features (RCF) (91 %), and richer convolutional features with generative adversarial network (RCF + GAN) (93 %).}

abstract = {Background
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) accounts for 70–80% of all ovarian cancer-related deaths. Multiple studies have suggested that the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) serves as the cell of origin of HGSOC. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and its loss is sufficient to induce numerous tumorigenic changes in FTE, including increased migration, formation of multicellular tumor spheroids (MTSs), and ovarian colonization. In murine oviductal epithelial (MOE) cells (the equivalent of human FTE) loss of PTEN results in the upregulation of transcripts associated with the extracellular matrix, with a specific focus on the elevation of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2). Although LOXL2 is known to drive transformation and invasion in solid tumors and is associated with a poor prognosis in ovarian cancer, its specific role in the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer originating from FTE remains unclear. Therefore, we aim to investigate whether LOXL2 mediates tumorigenesis from the fallopian tube epithelium.
Methods
In this study, we utilized clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CAS9) technology to delete LOXL2 in PTEN-deficient MOE cells to understand its role in mediating the oncogenic effects of PTEN loss. In addition, CRISPR-CAS9 was used to delete LOXL2 in OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cells. We monitored the changes in tumorigenic properties, such as migration, invasion, and growth of three-dimensional (3D) spheroids, to assess whether the loss of LOXL2 resulted in any changes.
Results
We found that a reduction in LOXL2 expression did not significantly change the migration or invasive capabilities of PTEN-depleted MOE or human ovarian cancer cells. However, we found that a reduction in LOXL2 expression resulted in a significant reduction in 3D MTS formation and survival in both lines.
Conclusions
These results reveal for the first time that PTEN loss in FTE cells increases LOXL2 expression through downregulation of Pax2, and LOXL2 deletion blocks 3D spheroid formation.}

abstract = {Background
Nursing education increasingly emphasizes academic writing and communication, critical for delivering quality patient care and professional advancement. Rapidly emerging artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot are transforming educational methodologies, and a focus is being placed on embedding AI literacy to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. These technologies have the potential to reshape nursing education in a technology-driven health-care landscape.
Aim
This study investigated the effectiveness of AI literacy and the application of ChatGPT and Copilot in academic nursing report writing. It assessed the level of AI literacy of nursing students, examined the integration of basic AI concepts into a curriculum, and analyzed the impact of these tools compared with traditional teaching methods.
Methods
The study adopted a sample of 203 senior nursing students from Southern Taiwan to compare an AI-enhanced teaching approach using ChatGPT and Copilot with conventional methods. The curriculum, centered on the “Writing Case Reports and Seminars” course, employed the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate model and incorporated scaffolding techniques to synergistically integrate clinical skills with academic learning. AI literacy was measured using the Meta AI Literacy Scale (MAILS). Summative assessments, adhering to the Taiwan Nursing Association standards, focused on individual and group case report evaluations.
Findings
Following an 18-week AI intervention, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in all dimensions of the MAILS. A ChatGPT usage of 100 % was found, with a notable enhancement discovered in the “Nursing Plan” section of case reports. Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group.
Conclusions
The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education.}

Here, a data augmentation method based on the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (GP) and Content Constraint Penalty (CP) terms, a generative deep-learning model via the adversarial training of a generator and a discriminator, was established, in which the GP and CP terms ensure training stability and the physical rationality of the generated samples. The results indicate that the generated samples improve the performance of the oxynitride glass composition-property models trained with the XGBoost algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization capability. Furthermore, the augmented models outperform the general glass prediction model, GlassNet, over 101 experimental samples not included in the training datasets. Based on SHAP's single feature analysis and feature interaction analysis, the interpretability study further sheds light on the contributions of elements and the interactive effects of element pairs on the properties of oxynitride glasses. These achievements not only provide reliable models for the composition-property studies of oxynitride glasses but also offer a novel strategy for developing high-performance data-driven models under data scarcity scenarios.}

These challenges include human–robot collaboration safety, the complexity of non-standard mobile collaborative task solutions, and the deployment timeliness of heterogeneous robots and mechanical structures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a general and robust “cloud–edge-terminal-network-intelligence” multi-robot mobile collaboration system. This framework achieves efficient customised solutions by standardising and simplifying robot hardware and software integration. The solution focuses on three key issues: modular design, cloud–edge architecture in advanced manufacturing, and rapid deployment of heterogeneous multi-robots. The paper discusses robot safety and collaborative control issues and provides corresponding technical solutions.}

abstract = {Question-asking, an underexplored aspect of creativity, is integral to creative problem-solving and information-seeking. Previous research reveals that lower creativity correlates with asking simpler, closed questions, while higher creativity correlates with complex, open-ended inquiries. The present study explores the relation between question asking complexity and problem-solving tasks involving open- and close-ended thinking and how these abilities generalize and compare to AI. In Study 1, participants (N = 89) completed the alternative questions task (AQT), a close-ended riddles task (Stumpers), and the alternate uses task (AUT), a creativity measure. Our results show AQT question complexity wasn't correlated with stumpers performance, although it correlated with AUT originality (r = .3). In Study 2, participants (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, and open-ended creative problem-solving (CPS) task. CPS responses were evaluated for originality and quality. A positive correlation was observed between CPS quality and AQT complexity (r = .29) and originality (r = .34). In study 3, AI agents (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, stumpers, and CPS tasks. Like humans, AI's AQT originality and complexity were related with open, but not closed problem-solving. AI questions were also significantly more creative and complex, it solved more stumpers and gave higher quality CPS solutions. Surprisingly, human and AI CPS originality didn't differ. We find significant links between question complexity and open—but not closed-ended—problem-solving in humans, which generalize to AI. Our results highlight the significance of complex and creative question-asking in everyday life and as an integral part of our problem-solving toolkit.}

In the GNDRE model, not only are the observation equations and/or system equations functionally nonlinear, but also random effects may appear in any part of the problem. This situation can be seen when one has to fuse the data from different sensors, including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial Navigation System (INS) and vision sensors. In other words, here we consider not only the random noise in the observation vector, but also the random errors that may appear in all parts of the functional model. These scattered noises can be, for example, due to ground vision data. The GEKF algorithm is developed based on condition equations. It helps us to obtain the predicted residuals directly. Also, a rigorous posterior dispersion (variance–covariance) matrix of the unknown parameters is obtained. Therefore, considering all possible random noises and a rigorous approach including a proper linearization of functional model and prediction of posterior dispersion are the two main characteristics of the proposed algorithm. The results of the integration navigation for a GNSS/Vision/INS system approve the efficiency of the proposed approach. In particular, the new GEKF is implemented in the integrated navigation of two low-cost tightly coupled GNSS/Vision/INS systems in which random effects can play an important role, particularly, in some cases there is lack of reliable data.}

But the psychological mechanisms underlying this tendency remain unclear. Prior research has relied entirely on self-reports that are vulnerable to bias. This leaves open the question as to whether negative reactions are a reflection of motivated reasoning – a controlled, cognitive process in which people justify their scepticism about AI's creative capacity – or whether they stem from deeper, embodied feelings of threat to human creative uniqueness manifested physiologically. We address this question across two lab-in-field studies, measuring participants' self-reported and physiological responses to the same piece of music framed either as having AI or human origins. Study 1 (N = 50) revealed that individuals in the AI condition appreciated music less, reported less intense emotions, and experienced decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity as compared to those in the human condition. Study 2 (N = 372) showed that these effects were more pronounced among individuals who more strongly endorsed the belief that creativity is uniquely human, and that this could largely be explained by the perceived threat posed by AI. Together, these findings suggest that unfavourable responses to AI-generated music are not driven solely by controlled cognitive justifications but also by automatic, embodied threat reactions in response to creative AI. They suggest that strategies addressing perceived threats posed by AI may be key to fostering more harmonious human-AI collaboration and acceptance.}

Each laser-cut layer must preserve global connectivity and minimize fine branching to maintain structural integrity. Traditionally reliant on artisanal trial-and-error, MWCA design has been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Our method is driven by a key observation: during connectivity analysis, the region of an upper layer can be treated as part of the lower layers. Leveraging this insight, we develop an iterative greedy algorithm to jointly determine the color assignment and geometric shape of each layer. To facilitate processing, we perform an image pre-processing step that reduces the input to a limited color palette. Additionally, a post-processing step is incorporated to enhance the structural integrity of the final output. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practical viability of our approach through 18 examples, including 3 fabrication results.}

This membrane design stands out for its unique structure, consisting of a thin dense layer at its core and two graded porous substrates that adhere symmetrically to this middle layer. In comparison to previously reported PLNCG hollow fiber membranes, the GPSS membrane offers superior oxygen permeation flux, exceeding that of the hollow fiber membrane by more than four times. When using air as the feed gas and even when introducing CO2 into the feed gas or sweep gas, the membrane maintains a consistent oxygen permeation flux of 4.41 mL min−1 cm−2 (STP). This work demonstrates that by paying close attention to membrane structure, the oxygen permeation flux of flat membranes can surpass that of hollow fiber membranes. Given its exceptional oxygen separation performance, the PLNCG-GPSS membrane holds great potential for practical applications such as high-purity oxygen production, pure hydrogen production, oxygen-involved catalytical reactions, and CO2 capture and storage.}

The microscopic porosity in the hierarchical porous lattice implant plays a crucial role in transporting nutrients and promoting tissue regeneration. However, it is difficult to fabricate microscopic pores smaller than 200 μm by powder bed fusion (PBF) processes due to the limitations of the laser spot size. In this study, the preparation of a hierarchical porous lattice implant with microscopic porosity is proposed by coupling structure design with the high scanning speed - short hatch spacing (HSSH) process formation. The structure-versus-process relationship is used to control the size and distribution of the microscopic pores, which meets the requirements of modulus and high biocompatibility. This proposed process breaks the inherent law where the higher the porosity, the higher the modulus of the lattice for the same lattice type. The modulus and porosity of the hierarchical porous implants could be flexibly tuned over a wide range (0.1–1.8 GPa and 63–84 %, respectively). The microscopic porosity is mainly distributed near the contour of the core rod, and the macroscopic porosity and microscopic porosity are approximately 73.70 % and 8.22 %, respectively. The problem of large errors in fitting the hierarchical porous lattice modulus calculation model according to the Gibson-Ashby equation has been solved. The mechanism of microscopic porosity formation was also analyzed. Furthermore, this method has the advantage of universal applicability, providing a feasible way for the development and application of porous materials.}

abstract = {Introduction
Recent reviews suggest that PRP injections can improve pain and function more effectively than other treatments; however, consensus on the optimal number of injections is lacking. We aimed to determine the optimal administration frequency and number of PRP injections for management of osteoarthritis (OA) symptoms, to examine long-term effects and structural improvements with PRP, and to determine correlations between clinical outcomes and imaging findings.
Methods
This longitudinal study included 167 patients with knee OA, categorized using the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading system. Participants received up to six PRP injections and were followed-up for 24 months. Pain levels were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS); functional recovery was measured using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). To determine whether PRP can induce sustained structural improvements, we used the MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) to monitor changes in bone-marrow lesions (BMLs). Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance to identify significant changes in pain and functional outcomes.
Results
VAS and KOOS scores significantly improved after PRP treatment. Patients with KL grades 1 and 2 exhibited maximum pain relief after the fourth injection; those with KL grades 3 and 4 showed optimal results after the fifth injection. Improvements were maintained or enhanced at the 24-month follow-up. The effect size increased as the number of treatments progressed, and especially after the fourth treatment, with a Cohen's d values of −1.22, −1.28, and −0.99 (p < 0.0001).
Conclusions
PRP injections administered at specific intervals can significantly reduce pain and improve function in patients with OA, with the required frequency depending on disease severity. These findings support the customization of PRP-treatment protocols based on individual patient profiles to maximize therapeutic benefits.

abstract = {Background
The success of eHealth relies on interorganizational collaboration (IOC) throughout the development, evaluation, and implementation phases of eHealth deployment. This IOC is complex, as it involves a diversity of organizations from different sectors, such as technological, academic, health care, and governmental organizations, collaborating to deploy eHealth. Between these organizations, organizational boundaries, defined as the demarcation of an organization from its environment, arise. When these boundaries are perceived as aligned and enable complementarity, IOC is facilitated. By contrast, misalignment of organizational boundaries can hinder IOC. A dialogical learning mechanism, defined as a learning process that occurs when boundaries hinder IOC, can support learning how to navigate such boundaries. However, it is difficult to determine whether and when organizational boundaries facilitate or hinder IOC, and which dialogical learning mechanisms can be used to address these challenges during eHealth deployment. Previous literature presents the barriers and facilitators of IOC during eHealth deployment only for subsets of organizations or specific phases, leaving their generic versus phase specific applicability uncharted.
Objective
This scoping review aims to identify whether, and under what circumstances, organizational boundaries facilitate or hinder IOC during the development, evaluation, and implementation of eHealth.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using searches in the PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were empirical studies written in English or Dutch and contained findings on factors influencing IOC during the development, evaluation, or implementation phases of eHealth deployment. The search yielded 11,867 articles, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. Open and axial coding of the extracted findings was performed to identify organizational boundaries and dialogical learning mechanisms that hindered or facilitated IOC during eHealth deployment.
Results
In each phase, different organizational boundaries either hindered or facilitated IOC. The dialogical learning mechanism identification was crucial for enhancing IOC and was supported by training or by establishing IOC from previous relationships. Additionally, the learning mechanism coordination improved IOC and depended on the involvement of boundary spanners (ie, individuals who span organizational boundaries) and the use of boundary objects (ie, objects which help bridge different social worlds). Furthermore, the mechanism reflection, fostered through open and frequent communication, facilitated IOC. The dialogical learning mechanism transformation did not influence IOC during any phase of eHealth deployment.
Conclusions
IOC in eHealth deployment is a dynamic process that depends on the dialogical learning mechanisms identification, coordination, and reflection to navigate organizational boundaries. This review is the first to present organizational boundaries and dialogical learning mechanisms that influence IOC across the different phases of eHealth deployment. However, further research that explicitly considers these phases is needed to deepen the understanding of IOC in eHealth deployment.}

The use of large language models (LLMs) as writing assistance for medical professionals is a promising approach to reduce the time required for documentation, but there may be practical, ethical, and legal challenges in many jurisdictions complicating the use of the most powerful commercial LLM solutions.
Objective
In this study, we assessed the feasibility of using nonproprietary LLMs of the GPT variety as writing assistance for medical professionals in an on-premise setting with restricted compute resources, generating German medical text.
Methods
We trained four 7-billion–parameter models with 3 different architectures for our task and evaluated their performance using a powerful commercial LLM, namely Anthropic’s Claude-v2, as a rater. Based on this, we selected the best-performing model and evaluated its practical usability with 2 independent human raters on real-world data.
Results
In the automated evaluation with Claude-v2, BLOOM-CLP-German, a model trained from scratch on the German text, achieved the best results. In the manual evaluation by human experts, 95 (93.1%) of the 102 reports generated by that model were evaluated as usable as is or with only minor changes by both human raters.
Conclusions
The results show that even with restricted compute resources, it is possible to generate medical texts that are suitable for documentation in routine clinical practice. However, the target language should be considered in the model selection when processing non-English text.}

Designing new therapeutics requires careful consideration of immune responses, particularly the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) reaction to intra-cellular proteins. In this study, we introduce CAPE-Beam, a novel decoding strategy for the established ProteinMPNN protein design model. Our approach minimizes CTL immunogenicity risk by limiting designs to only consist of kmers that are either predicted not to be presented to CTLs or are subject to central tolerance that prevents CTLs from attacking self-peptides. We compare CAPE-Beam to the standard way of sampling from ProteinMPNN and the state of the art (SOTA) technique CAPE-MPNN. We find that our novel decoding strategy can produce structurally similar proteins while incorporating more human like kmers. This significantly lowers CTL immunogenicity risk in precision medicine, and represents a key step towards reducing this risk in protein therapeutics targeting a wider patient population.

In particular, Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs), which integrate LLMs to simulate human behavior, have attracted increasing public attention due to their potential to model complex interactions in a wide range of artificial environments. This paper briefly reviews the disruptive role LLMs are playing in fields such as network science, evolutionary game theory, social dynamics, and epidemic modeling. We assess recent advancements, including the use of LLMs for predicting social behavior, enhancing cooperation in game theory, and modeling disease propagation. The findings demonstrate that LLMs can reproduce human-like behaviors, such as fairness, cooperation, and social norm adherence, while also introducing unique advantages such as cost efficiency, scalability, and ethical simplification. However, the results reveal inconsistencies in their behavior tied to prompt sensitivity, hallucinations and even the model characteristics, pointing to challenges in controlling these AI-driven agents. Despite their potential, the effective integration of LLMs into decision-making processes —whether in government, societal, or individual contexts— requires addressing biases, prompt design challenges, and understanding the dynamics of human-machine interactions. Future research must refine these models, standardize methodologies, and explore the emergence of new cooperative behaviors as LLMs increasingly interact with humans and each other, potentially transforming how decisions are made across various systems.}

abstract = {In the steel manufacturing industry, it is crucial to automatically recognize semi-finished product numbers to avoid mix-ups and ensure that each product is processed according to its specific material properties. The advancement of deep learning has significantly improved the recognition of steel product numbers, particularly those printed by machines with consistent thickness and spacing, resulting in high recognition accuracy. Conversely, handwritten numbers by workers are often challenging to recognize due to varying thickness, spacing, being too thin, partially erased, or overwritten with scribbles. This inconsistency causes low recognition accuracy of steel product number recognition models for fonts with insufficient training data or fonts not seen during training. The models must be updated periodically whenever a new font is used and remain vulnerable to new fonts until sufficient data is accumulated and updated. In this paper, we propose a Font Changer that converts various fonts into a representative font to address these issues. Font Changer is designed to learn the trajectory from a Gaussian distribution to the data distribution of images generated in a representative font with clean background. Font Changer, composed of a conditional image encoder and a diffusion model, extracts location, size, and number information from the original image containing the steel product number. The extracted information is then used as a condition for the diffusion model, allowing it to generate the closest sample within the data distribution. Images processed by the Font Changer exhibit uniformity, ensuring the consistency of steel product number images. Experiments demonstrate that the Font Changer enhances number recognition by removing background noise and converting even messy and damaged images into a consistent representative font. Our proposed method advances the steel manufacturing industry by standardizing fonts in work environments with diverse handwritten fonts.}

Objective
Investigating the effect of semi-occluded vocal tract training with a free-end tube on acoustic characteristics and glottal performance in dysphonic adults.
Study Design
A systematic review.
Methods
This systematic review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and was guided by the population, intervention, comparison, results and study design framework. Adults with dysphonia were included, while studies with psychiatric, cognitive, or cancer-related conditions were excluded. The intervention involved semi-occluded vocal tract training (SVOT) with a free-end straw, and outcomes included acoustic parameters (eg, jitter, shimmer, HNR, CPP, and F0) and contact quotient. A comprehensive search across multiple databases identified studies, and two independent reviewers screened and assessed them for inclusion. Bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB-2 tool, with results visualized via Robvis.
Results
This section outlines the inclusion of three studies with 127 participants from an initial pool of 5752 records. The studies varied in their methodologies, with one utilizing electroglottography evaluation and two employing acoustic assessments, while all reported different durations of vocal training. The Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool indicated a high risk of bias across the studies, primarily due to missing outcome data and randomization issues.
Conclusions
This systematic review highlights the beneficial effects of SVOT using a free-end tube in improving acoustic characteristics and glottal performance in dysphonic adults. The technique enhances vocal fold coordination, reduces tension, and promotes efficient phonation. Further research is recommended to explore its long-term effects and efficacy across various dysphonia subtypes.}

abstract = {The computational identification of nucleic acid-binding proteins (NABP) is of great significance for understanding the mechanisms of these biological activities and drug discovery. Although a bunch of sequence-based methods have been proposed to predict NABP and achieved promising performance, the structure information is often overlooked. On the other hand, the power of popular protein language models (pLM) has seldom been harnessed for predicting NABPs. In this study, we propose a novel framework called GraphNABP, to predict NABP by integrating sequence and predicted 3D structure information. Specifically, sequence embeddings and protein molecular graphs were first obtained from ProtT5 protein language model and predicted 3D structures, respectively. Then, graph attention (GAT) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks were used to enhance feature representations. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to predict NABPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to integrate AlphaFold and protein language models for the prediction of NABPs. The performances on multiple independent test sets indicate that GraphNABP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of pLM embeddings and structural information for NABP prediction.

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Significant secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR) is associated with poor prognosis, but its heterogeneity makes predicting patient outcomes challenging. Our objective was to identify STR prognostic phenogroups.
Methods
We analyzed 758 patients with moderate-to-severe STR: 558 (74±14 years, 55% women) in the derivation cohort and 200 (73±12 years, 60% women) in the external validation cohort. The primary endpoint was a composite of heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality.
Results
We identified 3 phenogroups. The low-risk phenogroup (2-year event-free survival 80%, 95%CI, 74%-87%) had moderate STR, preserved right ventricular (RV) size and function, and a moderately dilated but normally functioning right atrium. The intermediate-risk phenogroup (HR, 2.20; 95%CI, 1.44-3.37; P<.001) included older patients with severe STR, and a mildly dilated but uncoupled RV. The high-risk phenogroup (HR, 4.67; 95%CI, 3.20-6.82; P<.001) included younger patients with massive-to-torrential tricuspid regurgitation, as well as severely dilated and dysfunctional RV and right atrium. Multivariable analysis confirmed the clustering as independently associated with the composite endpoint (HR, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.13-1.70; P=.002). A supervised machine learning model, developed to assist clinicians in assigning patients to the 3 phenogroups, demonstrated excellent performance both in the derivation cohort (accuracy=0.91, precision=0.91, recall=0.91, and F1 score=0.91) and in the validation cohort (accuracy=0.80, precision=0.78, recall=0.78, and F1 score=0.77).
Conclusions
The unsupervised cluster analysis identified 3 risk phenogroups, which could assist clinicians in developing more personalized treatment and follow-up strategies for STR patients.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La insuficiencia tricuspídea secundaria (ITS) significativa se asocia a un mal pronóstico, pero su heterogeneidad dificulta la predicción de los resultados de los pacientes. Nuestro objetivo fue identificar fenogrupos pronósticos de ITS.
Métodos
Se analizó a 758 pacientes con ITS moderada a grave: 558 (74±14 años, 55% mujeres) en la cohorte de derivación y 200 (73±12 años, 60% mujeres) en la cohorte de validación externa. El criterio de valoración principal fue una combinación de hospitalización por insuficiencia cardiaca y mortalidad por todas las causas.
Resultados
Se identificaron 3 fenogrupos. El fenogrupo de bajo riesgo (supervivencia libre de acontecimientos a 2 años 80%, IC95%, 74-87%) tenía ITS moderada, tamaño y función del ventrículo derecho (VD) conservados, y aurícula derecha moderadamente dilatada, pero con funcionamiento normal. El fenogrupo de riesgo intermedio (HR=2,20; IC95%, 1,44-3,37; p<0,001) incluyó a pacientes mayores con ITS grave y VD levemente dilatado pero desacoplado. El fenogrupo de riesgo alto (HR=4,67; IC95%, 3,20-6,82; p<0,001) incluyó a pacientes más jóvenes con insuficiencia tricuspídea masiva a torrencial, y el VD y la aurícula derecha gravemente dilatados y disfuncionales. El análisis multivariable confirmó que la agrupación se asoció de forma independiente con el criterio de valoración compuesto (HR=1,40; IC95%, 1,13-1,70; p=0,002). Un modelo de aprendizaje automático supervisado, desarrollado para ayudar a los médicos a asignar pacientes a los 3 fenogrupos, demostró un excelente desempeño tanto en la derivación (exactitud=0,91, precisión=0,91, recuerdo=0,91 y puntuación F1=0,91) como en la cohorte de validación (exactitud=0,80, precisión=0,78, recuerdo=0,78 y puntuación F1=0,77).
Conclusiones
El análisis de conglomerados no supervisado identificó 3 fenogrupos de riesgo, que podrían ayudar a los médicos a desarrollar estrategias de seguimiento y tratamiento más personalizadas para los pacientes con ITS.}

abstract = {Purpose
Digital clothes (DCs) are an emerging product category whose commercial success will heavily depend on consumers’ perception of their economic and symbolic value. However, existing studies have overlooked the empirical assessment of consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for such products. As a result, the factors underlying consumers’ motivation to pay for them are still a matter of debate.
Design/methodology/approach
We ran three quantitative studies, including one involving participants in a real consumption context that assessed: (1) whether the perceived uniqueness of DCs increases consumers’ WTP for these products and (2) whether this effect depends on consumers’ sensation-seeking tendency (SST) and the instrumental need for touch (NFT).
Findings
We found that the higher the perceived uniqueness of DCs, the higher the consumers’ WTP for them. This effect was stronger for consumers who exhibited high SST and NFT.
Practical implications
DC developers and retailers should consider uniqueness as a key driver of DC consumption. They should target sensation seekers with high instrumental NFT who perceive DCs as unique products.
Originality/value
This research extends the understanding of the determinants of DC consumption by developing a framework that simultaneously accounts for the effects determined by a distinctive feature of these products (i.e. their uniqueness) as well as consumers’ personal characteristics.}

This study draws on an exploratory qualitative approach involving 24 international marketing professionals (with 3–30 years of experience) from Africa, Europe, the United States, and the Gulf region. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, using purposive sampling, and continued until theoretical saturation was achieved. Data analysis is based on a thematic content analysis method. Our analysis reveals three paradoxical perceptions (favorable, unfavorable, ambivalent) and identifies a novel five-category benefit taxonomy (technological, organizational, psychological, economic, communicational) alongside six barrier categories, challenging the linear adoption models prevalent in existing literature. The results show that professionals perceive AI primarily as a complementary tool that improves their individual performance while fundamentally transforming their profession. Theoretically, this study extends TAM by incorporating professional resistance and paradoxical adoption patterns, highlighting the limitations of linear acceptance models when applied to AI adoption within creative professional contexts. The study identifies the marketing experts’ perspectives on the future of their profession, the areas with high potential for AI impact, as well as the skills needed to remain relevant in the face of increasing integration of this technology. Practically, our findings provide a framework for managing AI adoption resistance in emerging markets and guidelines for organizations navigating the AI transformation paradox. Managerial implications are formulated to guide marketing professionals in the investment and use of AI, integrating it consistently into their daily practice.}

After describing our artifact selection, we offer relevant data and conclude with understanding and implications.
Findings
We argue that although online educator communities, particularly those on Reddit, offer opportunities for broad dialogical exchange for English educators, these can be marked by a push and pull between the expansion of the dialogical space and a tendency to rein it back in through reinforcing traditional power dynamics.

It emphasizes the collaborative cooperation between humans, machines and intelligent systems, and places humans at the core of the industrial production process, aiming to create a more flexible, personalized and sustainable production paradigm. Large language model, as an advanced natural language processing technology, has received attention from researchers related to Industry 5.0 due to its ease of use and powerful language processing capability. LLM is considered to be one of the key enabling technologies to drive the development of Industry 5.0 and has great application potential. After a rigorous review of existing approaches, we find there is few existing survey papers that focuses on how LLM will drive the development of Industry 5.0 applications. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the application of LLM in the field of Industry 5.0.

abstract = {Background
Synthetic dyes in industrial wastewater pose significant threats to the environment, aquatic ecosystems, and human health. Rhodamine B (RhB) is one such dye that is extensively used in the varied industries, highlighting its economic importance but also its prevalence as a pollutant. RhB has proven carcinogenic and mutagenic effects on living communities and induces numerous other ecological problems. It is therefore crucial to develop a practical and affordable technique to remove this dye from industrial wastewater. Advancements in technology have facilitated the development of photocatalysis, as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly method that indeed must be explored for the degradation of RhB.
Methods
This study introduces the synthesis of Al2O3/BiOBr composite via a facile approach. The as-synthesized composite was systematically characterized by using various structural and morphological analytical techniques. The as synthesized Al2O3/BiOBr composite was then evaluated in terms of its efficacy as photocatalyst in degrading RhB under direct sunlight.
Significant findings
The composite achieves a peak degradation efficiency of 99.6 % under direct sunlight within 160 min at optimal conditions i.e. pH 9, initial dye solution concentration of 0.010 g L−1, and a catalyst dose of 0.035 g L−1. Its recyclability was also demonstrated for five cycles. The findings position the Al2O3/BiOBr composite as a promising and effective photocatalyst, showcasing superior performance under direct sunlight irradiation. The high performance of the Al2O3/BiOBr composite was attributed to the synergism between the Al2O3 and BiOBr. The analysis revealed that Al2O3/BiOBr composite enhanced light absorption, and charge (electrons–holes) separation. The reactive radical test revealed that the ●OH, and ●O2– reactive oxygen species were dominant. The Z-scheme heterojunction mechanism for photocatalytic degradation was also deduced. Al2O3/BiOBr composite is shown to be an effective and sustainable photocatalyst and may be used for other photocatalytic-based energy and environmental applications.}

This study investigates the impact of gelator selection on the structure and three-dimensional (3D) printing performance of bigels. Formulations included a lipid-based low molecular weight gelator, glycerin monostearate (GMS), or a non-lipidic polymeric gelator, ethylcellulose (EC), in combination with thermally reversible hydrocolloids, sodium alginate (SA) or low acyl gellan gum (GG). The textural, rheological, thermal, and microstructural properties of bigels were evaluated to determine their suitability as 3D-printed adipose tissue analogs. Results demonstrated that GMS bigels formed a bicontinuous structure with higher viscosity, yield stress, and mechanical strength, whereas EC-based bigels exhibited a W/O structure with lower rigidity. GMS bigels effectively replicate the thermal softening of adipose tissue, closely mimicking its behavior under varying temperature conditions. Additionally, GMS bigels with smaller particle sizes demonstrated enhanced long-term structural stability. SA exhibited better printing performance than GG by enhancing self-supporting ability and shape retention after extrusion. GMS-SA resulted in the most structurally stable and printable bigels, characterized by smooth surfaces, strong appearance, and excellent extrusion fidelity. In contrast, EC-based bigels, while printable, demonstrated inferior mechanical properties and weaker structural integrity. These findings highlight the critical role of gelator selection in defining the functional properties of bigels, particularly in optimizing their performance as 3D-printable adipose tissue analogs. This study provides new insights into the formulation of plant-based fat analogs, contributing to the advancement of sustainable meat alternatives.}

Canada’s 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s findings concerning child welfare highlighted impacts resulting in Indigenous people’s dispossession, trauma, separation, and relational upheavals through forced removals and lasting harm to children, families and communities. Canadian Provincial government legislation over child welfare authority dominates and these outcomes continue today through child apprehensions. In 2020 the Canadian Federal Government enacted Bill C-92 respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families; a legal framework intended to reduce the gross over-representation of Indigenous children in care. It affirms the inherent jurisdictional authority of Indigenous communities over their child and family matters. In 2024 following some Provincial Governments’ legal challenges, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously confirmed C-92 is constitutional in its entirety. This article chronicles the efforts of a team of Indigenous Dene, provincially-delegated workers with extensive experience working within provincial child and family legislative frameworks. Within 15-months 47 children taken by Alberta Children’s Services from their rural community were returned and re-connected to their families, kin and culture. Culturally-based practices such as inclusion of ceremonial practices, using circle processes to conduct meetings and problem solve and respecting the traditional authority of matriarchs within the Indigenous Dene kinship system were key strategies in resisting and challenging the status quo of provincial child welfare authorities. These actions can encourage other communities to transform current child welfare approaches by restoring and reclaiming their own laws and traditional practices which offer alternative, humane and culturally-connected ways to protect children, support healing and rebuild communities.}

Based on the perspective of corporate governance costs, we discuss the influence and function mechanism of artificial intelligence on corporate tax avoidance. The results show that artificial intelligence can promote tax avoidance for enterprises by increasing high-skilled labor cost and intelligent input cost. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that artificial intelligence exerts a more influence on corporate tax avoidance in circumstances where tax regulatory intensity is diminished, and the tax burden is escalated. This study enriches the research on the development of enterprise intelligence in the new era, opens the "black box" between artificial intelligence and tax avoidance, and provides evidence for the logic between them.}

abstract = {Objectives
Cervical lymphadenopathy can indicate various benign or malignant conditions. While ultrasound-guided core biopsy is commonly used for diagnosis, its effectiveness can vary. Our study aimed to determine factors that affect the diagnostic yield of this procedure, potentially guiding appropriate patient referrals toward either more invasive diagnostic procedures, such as open biopsy, or less intensive approaches like ongoing follow up.
Methods
A retrospective study was conducted evaluating ultrasound-guided core biopsies performed for cervical lymphadenopathy at a single institution. Imaging features and technical details were documented. Two radiologists collected data from formal procedure reports and recorded sonographic images. Data were then correlated with histopathologic reports.
Results
The study included 136 patients with final diagnoses of lymphoproliferative disease (95 patients, 69.8%), reactive lymphadenopathy (24 cases, 17.6%) and carcinoma (17 patients, 12.5%). Twenty-four of the initial biopsies were nondiagnostic (17.6%), requiring diagnosis through surgery, follow-up, or repeated biopsy. Of the 24 nondiagnostic biopsies, 17 were eventually identified as reactive lymph nodes, and 7 harbored lymphoproliferative disease. All carcinoma cases were detected on the initial biopsy. Larger lymph node size correlated with higher diagnostic yield (p<0.01). No correlation was found with needle gauge (p=0.13), proximity to large vessels (p=0.68), or overshoot potential (p=0.26).
Conclusion
Our study results showed that smaller lymph node size and presence of a fatty hilum are correlated with reduced diagnostic yield. Patients with unfavorable characteristics should be considered for imaging surveillance, fine needle aspiration (FNA) or an open biopsy.}

We presented participants with pairs of visual clutters and recorded their electroencephalography during an emotion judgement task. In an upright flanker condition where both the central target face and flanker faces were upright faces, participants were less likely to report seeing the target face, and their P300 was weakened, compared to a scrambled flanker condition where scrambled face images were used as flankers. Additionally, at ∼ 120 ms post-stimulus, a posterior negativity was found for the upright compared to scrambled flanker condition, however only for fearful face targets. We concluded that early neural responses seem to be affected by the perceptual characteristics of both target and flanker stimuli whereas later-stage neural activity is associated with post-perceptual evaluation of the stimuli in this visual crowding paradigm.}

This task is particularly challenging due to the lack of 3D datasets for Chinese paintings and the limited research on their 3D reconstruction. As a result, direct access to multiple views is precluded. We propose a novel method for the 3D reconstruction of Traditional Chinese Painting Elements, termed TCPE-3D, which has three components of the process. The first component is a multi-view synthesis module named One To Six (OTX) - Multi-View Generating (MVG) Module. This module creates six fixed-view images through a series of preprocessing steps. These images are used to generate the Local Light Field Fusion (LLFF) dataset within the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) synthesis module. This process leads to the creation of detailed mesh structures in the final Mesh Generation module. Comparison with several state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods shows that our framework achieves better visualization results and higher technical specifications. Additionally, it solves the Janus problem encountered by other algorithms for Chinese painting data. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/LPDLG/3DTCP-Dataset.}

To improve SMP-based emulsions, we used food-grade amino acids as co-surfactants. Lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan lowered the water-oil interfacial tension. Tryptophan was the most effective, providing sufficient electrostatic repulsion to stabilize emulsion droplets by adsorbing onto the oil surface and becoming protonated at pH 3. However, tryptophan was counterproductive to stabilize SMP-based emulsions between pH 4 and 5. A minimum concentration (0.4 w/v%) of tryptophan prevented droplet coalescence and creaming. Incorporating tryptophan with SMP before emulsification resulted in larger droplets compared to post-emulsification addition. Tryptophan-costabilized emulsions induced flocculation with κ-carrageenan via electrostatic adsorption but showed higher compatibility with polysaccharides with weaker charges. Tryptophan enhanced oxidative stability of unsaturated lipids creating a cationic shield to repel transition metals in the aqueous phase and stabilizing cleavage of lipid hydroperoxides.}

Polarization is common in politics and public opinion. It is believed to be shaped by media as well as ideologies, and often incited by misinformation. However, little is known about the microscopic dynamics behind polarization and the resulting social tensions. By coupling opinion formation with the strategy selection in different social dilemmas, we reveal how success at an individual level transforms to global consensus or lack thereof. When defection carries with it the fear of punishment in the absence of greed, as in the stag-hunt game, opinion fragmentation is the smallest. Conversely, if defection promises a higher payoff and also evokes greed, like in the prisoner’s dilemma and snowdrift game, consensus is more difficult to attain. Our research thus challenges the top-down narrative of social tensions, showing they might originate from fundamental principles at individual level, like the desire to prevail in pairwise evolutionary comparisons.}

As a result, we identified three dispositional frames (running for training, health and recreation, and sociality) and three technological frames (technology as verificator, motivator, and safeguard), the combinations of which highlight the often multifaceted, layered, and situational relationship people have with recreational running and technology use.}

abstract = {Background
Research culture is strongly influenced by academic incentives and pressures such as the imperative to publish in academic journals, and can influence the nature and quality of the evidence we produce.
Objective
The purpose of this rapid scoping review is to capture the breadth of differential pressures and contributors to current research culture, drawing together content from empirical research specific to the health and biomedical sciences.
Study Design and Setting
PubMed and Web of Science were searched for empirical studies of influences and impacts on health and biomedical research culture, published between January 2012 and April 2024. Data charting extracted the key findings and relationships in research culture from included papers such as workforce composition; equitable access to research; academic journal trends, incentives, and reproducibility; erroneous research; questionable research practices; biases vested interests; and misconduct. A diverse author network was consulted to ensure content validity of the proposed framework of i) inclusivity, ii) transparency, iii) rigor, and iv) objectivity.
Results
A growing field of studies examining research culture exists ranging from the inclusivity of the scientific workforce, the transparency of the data generated, the rigor of the methods used and the objectivity of the researchers involved. Figurative diagrams are presented to storyboard the links between research culture content and findings.
Conclusion
The wide range of research culture influences in the recent literature indicates the need for coordinated and sustained research culture conversations. Core principles in effective research environments should include inclusive collaboration and diverse research workforces, rigorous methodological approaches, transparency, data sharing, and reflection on scientific objectivity.}

abstract = {Background
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) infection or exposure associated with soft tissue deficiency represents a challenging scenario for the reconstructive surgeon. The aim of the study is to determine the most successful reconstructive option for infected or exposed TKA comparing local muscle flaps (LMF), local fasciocutaneous flaps (LFF), and free muscle flaps (FMF).
Methods
A systematic review and single-arm network meta-analysis (PRISMA) was conducted to compare outcomes of complicated TKA requiring soft tissue coverage with either LMF, LFF and FMF. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023388731). PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were queried. MINORS criteria were employed for bias assessment. Outcomes included infection recurrence, TKA failure, above-knee amputation, and arthrodesis.
Results
A total of 30 studies and 555 flaps were included. Pooled prevalence was 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11–0.26) for infection recurrence, 0.18 (95% CI: 0.11–0.28) for arthroplasty failure, 0.10 (95% CI: 0.08–0.13) for above-knee amputation and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.08–0.13) for arthrodesis. Local fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated the lowest risk of infection recurrence (LFF = 0.04 ± 0.037, LMF = 0.27 ± 0.043, FMF = 0.26 ± 0.092), arthroplasty failure (LFF = 0.11 ± 0.068, LMF = 0.28 ± 0.045, FMF = 0.22 ± 0.094) and knee arthrodesis (LFF = 0.03 ± 0.027, LMF = 0.14 ± 0.03, FMF = 0.08 ± 0.06) after flap coverage of infected TKA. Free muscle flaps were associated with the lowest risk of above knee amputation (FMF = 0.08 ± 0.07, LFF = 0.10 ± 0.07, LMF = 0.11 ± 0.03). The mean MINORS score was 11.1 (95% CI: 11–12) with major weakness being the lack of prospective enrollment of the patients.
Conclusion
Based on the available literature, when appropriate, LFF appear to be the best reconstructive choice for soft tissue reconstruction in complicated TKA.}

abstract = {Objectives
To translate, cross-culturally adapt and study the psychometric properties of the Wisconsin Running Injury and Recovery Index (UWRI) in Italian runners with running-related injuries (RRI).
Design
clinometric study.
Setting
5 private outpatient physical therapy clinics.
Participants
144 subjects with RRI.
Main outcome measures
UWRI translation was performed following international guidelines. Structural validity (confirmatory factor analysis [CFA]), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha [α]), test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), measurement error (minimal detectable change [MDC]), and construct validity (hypothesis testing).
Results
UWRI translation was performed without issues. CFA showed a two-factor structure (i.e., running progression and symptom surveillance subscale) (comparative fit index = 0.988; Tucker–Lewis index = 0.977; root mean square error of approximation = 0.049; standardized root mean square residual = 0.042). Each subscale presented high internal consistency (α = 0.92 and 0.75 for the running progression and symptom surveillance subscales, respectively), excellent and good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.99 and 0.89 for the running progression and symptom surveillance subscales, respectively), and acceptable measurement error (MDC = 0.33 and 2.3 points for the running progression and symptom surveillance subscales, respectively). Construct validity was moderate for both subscales as 50.0 % (2/4) of a-priori hypotheses were satisfied.
Conclusion
The validation process revealed acceptable psychometric properties of the UWRI Italian version, which can be used for research and clinical purposes.}

abstract = {Deepfakes bring critical ethical issues about consent, authenticity, and the manipulation of digital content. Identifying Deepfake videos is one step towards fighting their malicious uses. While the previous works introduced accurate methods for Deepfake detection, the stability of the proposed methods is rarely discussed. The problem statement of this paper is to build a stable model for Deepfake detection. The results of the model should be reproducible. In other words, if other researchers repeat the same experiments, the results should not differ. The proposed technique combines multiple spatiotemporal textures and deep learning-based features. An enhanced 3D Convolutional Neural Network, which contains a spatiotemporal attention layer, is utilized in a Siamese architecture. Various analyses are carried out on the control parameters, feature importance, and reproducibility of results. Our technique is tested on four datasets: Celeb-DF, FaceForensics++, DeepfakeTIMIT, and FaceShifter. The results demonstrate that a Siamese architecture can improve the accuracy of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks by 7.9 % and reduce the standard deviation of accuracy to 0.016, which indicates reproducible results. Furthermore, adding texture features enhances accuracy by up to 91.96 %. The final model can achieve an Area Under Curve (AUC) up to 97.51 % and 95.44 % in same-dataset and cross-dataset scenarios, respectively. The main contributions of this work are the enhancement of model stability and the assurance of result repeatability, ensuring consistent results with high accuracy.}

However, despite representing unprecedented progress, emerging data also indicate that the full promise of psychiatric genetics—including understanding pathophysiology and improving personalized care—will not be fully realized by targeting traditional dichotomous diagnostic categories. The current article provides reflections on themes that emerged from a 2021 National Institute of Mental Health–sponsored conference convened to address strategies for the evolving field of psychiatric genetics. As anticipated by the National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria framework, multilevel investigations of dimensional and transdiagnostic phenotypes, particularly when integrated with biobanks and big data, will be critical to advancing knowledge. The path forward will also require more diverse representation in source studies. Additionally, progress will be catalyzed by a range of converging approaches, including capitalizing on computational methods, pursuing biological insights, working within a developmental framework, and engaging health care systems and patient communities.}

abstract = {Purpose
To assess the ability of ChatGPT-4, an automated Chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, to answer common patient questions concerning the Latarjet procedure for patients with anterior shoulder instability and compare this performance with Google Search Engine.
Methods
Using previously validated methods, a Google search was first performed using the query “Latarjet.” Subsequently, the top 10 frequently asked questions (FAQs) and associated sources were extracted. ChatGPT-4 was then prompted to provide the top 10 FAQs and answers concerning the procedure. This process was repeated to identify additional FAQs requiring discrete-numeric answers to allow for a comparison between ChatGPT-4 and Google. Discrete, numeric answers were subsequently assessed for accuracy on the basis of the clinical judgment of 2 fellowship-trained sports medicine surgeons who were blinded to search platform.
Results
Mean (± standard deviation) accuracy to numeric-based answers was 2.9 ± 0.9 for ChatGPT-4 versus 2.5 ± 1.4 for Google (P = .65). ChatGPT-4 derived information for answers only from academic sources, which was significantly different from Google Search Engine (P = .003), which used only 30% academic sources and websites from individual surgeons (50%) and larger medical practices (20%). For general FAQs, 40% of FAQs were found to be identical when comparing ChatGPT-4 and Google Search Engine. In terms of sources used to answer these questions, ChatGPT-4 again used 100% academic resources, whereas Google Search Engine used 60% academic resources, 20% surgeon personal websites, and 20% medical practices (P = .087).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 demonstrated the ability to provide accurate and reliable information about the Latarjet procedure in response to patient queries, using multiple academic sources in all cases. This was in contrast to Google Search Engine, which more frequently used single-surgeon and large medical practice websites. Despite differences in the resources accessed to perform information retrieval tasks, the clinical relevance and accuracy of information provided did not significantly differ between ChatGPT-4 and Google Search Engine.
Clinical Relevance
Commercially available large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT-4, can perform diverse information retrieval tasks on-demand. An important medical information retrieval application for LLMs consists of the ability to provide comprehensive, relevant, and accurate information for various use cases such as investigation about a recently diagnosed medical condition or procedure. Understanding the performance and abilities of LLMs for use cases has important implications for deployment within health care settings.}
