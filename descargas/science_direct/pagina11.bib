abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have become integral part in advancing next generation wireless communication systems by enabling sophisticated data modeling and feature extraction for enhanced network performance. In the realm of open radio access networks (O-RAN), characterized by their disaggregated architecture and heterogeneous components from multiple vendors, the deployment of generative models offers significant advantages for network management such as traffic analysis, traffic forecasting and anomaly detection. However, the complex and dynamic nature of O-RAN introduces challenges that necessitate not only accurate detection mechanisms but also reduced complexity, scalability, and most importantly interpretability to facilitate effective network management. In this study, we introduce the XAInomaly framework, an explainable and interpretable Semi-supervised (SS) Deep Contractive Autoencoder (DeepCAE) design for anomaly detection in O-RAN. Our approach leverages the generative modeling capabilities of our SS-DeepCAE model to learn compressed, robust representations of normal network behavior, which captures essential features, enabling the identification of deviations indicative of anomalies. To address the black-box nature of deep learning models, we propose reactive Explainable AI (XAI) technique called fastshap-C, which is providing transparency into the model’s decision-making process and highlighting the features contributing to anomaly detection.}

To understand their emotional expressions in facing different shopping experience scenarios, this paper presents a sentiment analysis method that combines the e-commerce review keyword-generated image with a hybrid machine learning-based model, in which the Word2Vec-TextRank is used to extract keywords that act as the inputs for generating the related images by generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Subsequently, a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM) model is applied for sentiment classification of those keyword-generated images. For method validation, the data randomly comprised of 5000 reviews from Amazon have been analyzed. With superior keyword extraction capability, the proposed method achieves impressive results on sentiment classification with a remarkable accuracy of up to 97.13%. Such performance demonstrates its advantages by using the text-to-image approach, providing a unique perspective for sentiment analysis in the e-commerce review data compared to the existing works. Thus, the proposed method enhances the reliability and insights of customer feedback surveys, which would also establish a novel direction in similar cases, such as social media monitoring and market trend research.}

This approach has achieved impressive results and has contributed significantly to the progress of AI, particularly in the sphere of supervised deep learning. It has also simplified the design of machine learning systems as the learning process is highly automated. However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for big data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages. In this work, we present a thorough review of approaches for automating data processing tasks in deep learning pipelines, including automated data preprocessing – e.g., data cleaning, labeling, missing data imputation, and categorical data encoding – as well as data augmentation (including synthetic data generation using generative AI methods) and feature engineering – specifically, automated feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection. In addition to automating specific data processing tasks, we discuss the use of AutoML methods and tools to simultaneously optimize all stages of the machine learning pipeline.}

A more balanced approach to the technology is needed. Instances of apparently positive results need calm analysis, firstly to distinguish mirages from genuine contributions; secondly, to identify ways to effectively exploit the new capabilities; and thirdly, to formulate guidance for the avoidance and mitigation of negative consequences. This article's first contribution is to ground the evaluation of GenAI's pathway, applications, impacts, implications and risks in a sufficiently deep appreciation of the technology's nature and key features. A wide range of sources is drawn on, in order to present descriptions of the processes involved in text-based GenAI. From those processes, 20 key characteristics are abstracted that together give rise to the promise and the threats GenAI embodies. The effects of GenAI derive not from the technological features alone, but also from the patterns within which it is put to use. By mapping usage patterns across to domains of application, the phenomenon's impacts and implications can be more reliably delineated. The analysis provides a platform whereby the article's final contribution can be made. Previously-formulated principles for the responsible application of AI of all kinds are applied in the particular context of GenAI.}

ChatGPT has demonstrated the capability of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)-powered chatbots when deployed to answer crisis-related questions in a timely and cost-efficient manner, thus replacing humans in crisis communication. However, public reactions to such messages remain unknown. To address this problem, this study recruited participants (N1 = 399, N2 = 189, and N3 = 121) and conducted two online vignette experiments and a qualitative survey. The results suggest that, when organizations fail to handle crisis-related requests, stakeholders exhibit higher satisfaction and lower responsibility attribution to chatbots providing instructing (vs. adjusting) information, as they are perceived to be more competent. However, when organizations satisfy requests, chatbots that provide adjusting (vs. instructing information) lead to higher satisfaction and lower responsibility attribution due to higher perceived competence. The second experiment involving a public emergency crisis scenario reveals that, regardless of the information provided (instructing or adjusting), stakeholders exhibit greater satisfaction and positive attitudes toward high-competence (vs. low-competence) chatbots. The qualitative study further confirms the experimental findings and offers insights to improve crisis chatbots. These findings contribute to the literature by extending situational crisis communication theory to nonhuman touchpoints and providing a deeper understanding of using chatbots in crisis communication through the lens of machine heuristics. The study also offers practical guidance for organizations to strategically integrate chatbots and human agents in crisis management based on context.}

abstract = {Background
The release of ChatGPT for general use in 2023 by OpenAI has significantly expanded the possible applications of generative artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector, particularly in terms of information retrieval by patients, medical and nursing students, and healthcare personnel.
Objective
To compare the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0 to clinical nurses on answering questions about tracheostomy care, as well as to determine whether using different prompts to pre-define the scope of the ChatGPT affects the accuracy of their responses.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
The data collected from the ChatGPT was collected using the ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0 using access provided by the University of Hong Kong. The data from the clinical nurses working in mainland China was collected using the Qualtrics survey program.
Participants
No participants were needed for collecting the ChatGPT responses. A total of 272 clinical nurses, with 98.5 % of them working in tertiary care hospitals in mainland China, were recruited using a snowball sampling approach.
Method
We used 43 tracheostomy care-related questions in a multiple-choice format to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and clinical nurses. ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 were both queried three times with the same questions by different prompts: no prompt, patient-friendly prompt, and act-as-nurse prompt. All responses were independently graded by two qualified otorhinolaryngology nurses on a 3-point accuracy scale (correct, partially correct, and incorrect). The Chi-squared test and Fisher exact test with post-hoc Bonferroni adjustment were used to assess the differences in performance between the three groups, as well as the differences in accuracy between different prompts.
Results
ChatGPT-4.0 showed significantly higher accuracy, with 64.3 % of responses rated as ‘correct’, compared to 60.5 % in ChatGPT-3.5 and 36.7 % in clinical nurses (X 2 = 74.192, p < .001). Except for the ‘care for the tracheostomy stoma and surrounding skin’ domain (X2 = 6.227, p = .156), scores from ChatGPT-3.5 and -4.0 were significantly better than nurses’ on domains related to airway humidification, cuff management, tracheostomy tube care, suction techniques, and management of complications. Overall, ChatGPT-4.0 consistently performed well in all domains, achieving over 50 % accuracy in each domain. Alterations to the prompt had no impact on the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 or -4.0.
Conclusion
ChatGPT may serve as a complementary medical information tool for patients and physicians to improve knowledge in tracheostomy care.
Tweetable abstract
ChatGPT-4.0 can answer tracheostomy care questions better than most clinical nurses. There is no reason nurses should not be using it.}

Reinforcement learning (RL) enables a decision maker (agent) to observe, learn, and select optimal actions within a dynamic environment over time. The combination of these two artificial intelligence approaches, referred to as GAN-RL, presents a powerful synergy that leverages their strengths while addressing their respective limitations. This paper provides the first comprehensive review that systematically examines GAN-RL, offering an in-depth analysis of its theoretical foundations, key methodologies, and diverse applications. Specifically, we categorize GAN-RL approaches based on five primary objectives: (a) generating comprehensive synthetic datasets for training; (b) minimizing the discrepancies between value (or cumulative reward) distributions, where the cumulative reward is defined as the total sum of rewards an agent accumulates over the course of its interactions with the environment; (c) predicting the next scenario; (d) predicting the gradient of the generator in discrete tasks; and (e) learning from demonstrations. Our analysis highlights how GAN-RL enhances system performance, including improvements in cumulative reward, convergence rate, and prediction accuracy. By identifying open challenges and future research directions, this review fills a critical gap in the literature and serves as a valuable resource for researchers exploring the intersection of GANs and RL.}

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have shown promising potential in supporting medical education and clinical decision-making, given their vast knowledge base and natural language processing capabilities. As a general purpose AI system, ChatGPT can complete a wide range of tasks, including differential diagnosis without additional training. However, the specific application of ChatGPT in learning and applying a series of specialized, context-specific tasks mimicking the workflow of a human assessor, such as administering a standardized assessment questionnaire, followed by inputting assessment results in a standardized form, and interpretating assessment results strictly following credible, published scoring criteria, have not been thoroughly studied.
Objective
This exploratory study aims to evaluate and optimize ChatGPT’s capabilities in administering and interpreting the Sour Seven Questionnaire, an informant-based delirium assessment tool. Specifically, the objectives were to train ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 to understand and correctly apply the Sour Seven Questionnaire to clinical vignettes using prompt engineering, assess the performance of these AI models in identifying and scoring delirium symptoms against scores from human experts, and refine and enhance the models’ interpretation and reporting accuracy through iterative prompt optimization.
Methods
We used prompt engineering to train ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 models on the Sour Seven Questionnaire, a tool for assessing delirium through caregiver input. Prompt engineering is a methodology used to enhance the AI’s processing of inputs by meticulously structuring the prompts to improve accuracy and consistency in outputs. In this study, prompt engineering involved creating specific, structured commands that guided the AI models in understanding and applying the assessment tool’s criteria accurately to clinical vignettes. This approach also included designing prompts to explicitly instruct the AI on how to format its responses, ensuring they were consistent with clinical documentation standards.
Results
Both ChatGPT models demonstrated promising proficiency in applying the Sour Seven Questionnaire to the vignettes, despite initial inconsistencies and errors. Performance notably improved through iterative prompt engineering, enhancing the models’ capacity to detect delirium symptoms and assign scores. Prompt optimizations included adjusting the scoring methodology to accept only definitive “Yes” or “No” responses, revising the evaluation prompt to mandate responses in a tabular format, and guiding the models to adhere to the 2 recommended actions specified in the Sour Seven Questionnaire.
Conclusions
Our findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential utility of AI models such as ChatGPT in administering standardized clinical assessment tools. The results highlight the significance of context-specific training and prompt engineering in harnessing the full potential of these AI models for health care applications. Despite the encouraging results, broader generalizability and further validation in real-world settings warrant additional research.}

We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA.

abstract = {Mass individualization is calling for a more sustainable manufacturing paradigm which can address the paradoxes of diversity, complexity, and affordability. Social Manufacturing (SM) represents a democratized servitization trend trying to reshape the traditional production relationship between consumers and manufacturers. To achieve the SM visions, new operational mechanisms for SM should be constructed to overcome the challenges of information sharing, accuracy, efficiency, security, sovereignty, etc. The survey found that task assignment (TA) is one of the foundational mechanisms for the implementation of regular autonomous manufacturing systems, as well as the role of TA is further amplified for distributed collaborative environments. Therefore, inspired by the relevant research of management science, Platform-based Task Assignment (PBTA) is proposed to distinguish and conceptualize this different research topic. In SM platforms, the diverse capacities and resources can be shared, so that knowing "who can do” and “select whom to do" is more important than knowing "how to do". Furthermore, the studies on TA for SM present a difference from the previous studies on TA in manufacturing. From a perspective of supply-demand mapping, PBTA illustrates the foundational operational mechanism for SM attracting many researchers’ attention from different fields. Meanwhile, research on PBTA is also required for the platform practices in the era of digital, shared, and platform economy. Given the academic importance and practical value, this survey carefully selects 250 valuable research articles relevant to PBTA for SM. A novel workflow model and knowledge framework, namely PBTA4SM, is proposed to identify and organize the critical issues and challenges. This study shows the state-of-the-art research advancement of PBTA including task design considerations, modelling methods, typical engineering problems, algorithms, decision patterns, key activities, and governance mechanisms. Finally, we complete this holistic survey by highlighting eight potential directions for future research in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) era.}

A salient question in these debates pertains to perceptions of the extent to which creators contribute to the co-produced output. As the current research establishes, the answer to this question depends on the evaluation target. Nine studies (seven preregistered, total N = 4498) document that people evaluate their own contributions to co-produced outputs with ChatGPT as higher than those of others. This systematic self–other difference stems from differential inferences regarding types of GenAI usage behavior: People think that they predominantly use GenAI for inspiration, but others use it to outsource work. These self–other differences in turn have direct ramifications for GenAI acceptability perceptions, such that usage is considered more acceptable for the self than for others. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for science, education, and marketing.}

abstract = {Building energy performance forecasting (BEPF) is an active area of research with the potential to improve the efficiency of building energy management systems, support global sustainability goals, and mitigate climate change impacts. This systematic review examines three main prediction methods: model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid-driven, each with different principles, basics, advantages, disadvantages, practical applications, challenges, and limitations in addressing the complexities of building energy performance. The review focuses on key influencing factors, including building features, climatic conditions, and occupant behavior, while identifying critical research gaps in current methodologies. Through a bibliometric analysis of 95 relevant publications from 2019 to 2024, this review provides a quantitative overview of research progress and emerging trends. Findings indicate that although BEPF techniques have evolved rapidly, most studies continue to overlook the variability and complexity of occupant behavior, a factor with significantly affects forecast accuracy. To address this, we propose a modular AI-integrated forecasting framework that leverages the strengths of existing approaches, integrates real-time IoT data, and incorporate advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). A decision-making framework is also introduced to guide method selection based on specific building characteristics, data availability, desired accuracy, and operational goals, offering practical guidance for engineering and policy applications. Additionally, future research should extend beyond individual building dynamics to include a wider range of community-level determinants, such as policy frameworks, economic factors, and social determinants of health considerations (SDOH), aiming for a more comprehensive understanding of building energy consumption patterns. This review not only synthesizes current knowledge but also lays the foundation for future innovations in BEPF. We advocate for moving towards an AI-enhanced, adaptive forecasting model that can integrate different driven methods, capture the variability and unpredictability of occupant behavior, and improve the accuracy and reliability of energy forecasts.}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming much of software development, yet its application in software architecture is still in its infancy.
Aim:
Systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and challenges of GenAI in software architecture.
Method:
Multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, reported challenges, and extracting themes via open coding.
Results:
This review identifies a significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to the initial stages of the Software Architecture Life Cycle (SALC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the main targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks.
Conclusions:
GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but there are several challenges on its way towards greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to overcome the gap between theoretical possibility and practical use.

Results showed that video-based self-learning with TALPer support yielded the highest learning gains. In the remedial setting, students receiving TALPer support also demonstrated significantly better performance. Both approaches were particularly effective for low-achieving students. Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA) further revealed that high-achieving students engaged in more complex interaction patterns with TALPers, sustaining feedback cycles, whereas low-achieving students exhibited simpler interaction patterns. These findings provide empirical support for implementing AI-augmented learning systems in mathematics education and suggest that structured AI support can promote differentiated instruction and student engagement to help bridge achievement gaps.}

abstract = {Background
Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) has exhibited great potential in the treatment of food allergy. However, there is no global consensus on best practices of OIT. Parents of allergic children often struggle with concerns regarding OIT methodology, safety, and lack of accessible educational resources. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot from OpenAI recognized for its ability to formulate human-like conversations. Although applications of artificial intelligence in medical settings continue to be explored, the effectiveness of ChatGPT as an educational resource remains unknown for OIT.
Objective
To assess the accuracy of ChatGPT as a self-guided educational resource for parents with children undergoing OIT.
Methods
A total of 14 common questions from parents regarding OIT were entered into ChatGPT version 3.5 and answers were copied verbatim. These responses were then categorized into basic, advanced, or medical, and evaluated by Allergy-Immunology health care practitioners from North America and the United Kingdom using a 10-point Likert scale. Response readability, understandability, and reproducibility were assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade level scores, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, and natural language processing tools, respectively.
Results
The average median rankings by the practitioners per category were 8.6, 8.4, and 7.8 for basic, advanced, and medical, respectively. ChatGPT responses exhibited low readability scores, corresponding with a high-grade reading level. Understandability was between 73% to 84%, with scores decreased owing to response complexity. When assessing reproducibility, ChatGPT responses achieved rates between 83% and 93%.
Conclusion
Our results revealed that ChatGPT provides intelligible and comprehensive responses to patient questions. Health care practitioners polled were generally positive but identified important limitations.}

In the face of the emergence of constantly evolving forgery techniques, we need a detection model with strong generalization and high robustness to deal with them. In this work, we propose a Robust and Unified Spoofing Audio Detection (RUSAD) scheme, which is capable of dealing with multiple attacks such as logic attacks, replay attacks and adversarial attacks. We propose an innovative scheme from the perspectives of upstream feature extraction and downstream spoofing classification: the self-supervised upstream learning model based on the Conformer network extracts speech representations, establishes probabilistic spectrum-augmentation events to improve model robustness against adversarial attacks, and formulate multiple decoding tasks for classification and regression; downstream classification of audio spoofing based on inference of the SE-ResNeXt network, supplemented by self-attention pooling and the OC-Softmax angular loss function in order to improve classification performance. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on both the ASVspoof2021 and ADD2023 datasets. The results show that the scheme has improved performance, generalization, and robustness in comparison to the baseline system as well as to most forensic countermeasures, which are capable of achieving the goal of dealing with multiple attacks.}

In light of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored whether integrating AI chatbots into positive psychology interventions could enhance their efficacy compared to traditional self-administered approaches. Study 1 examined the efficacy of a gratitude intervention delivered through Snapchat's My AI, while Study 2 evaluated a self-affirmation intervention integrated with a customized ChatGPT. Both studies employed within-subject experimental designs. Contrary to our hypotheses, the integration of AI did not yield incremental improvements in gratitude outcomes (Study 1), or self-view outcomes (Study 2) compared to existing non-AI interventions. However, exploratory analyses revealed that the AI-integrated self-affirmation intervention significantly enhanced life satisfaction and medium-arousal positive affect, suggesting potential benefits for selected well-being outcomes. These findings indicate that while AI integration in brief, self-administered positive psychology interventions may enhance certain outcomes, its suitability varies across intervention types.

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models, has rapidly developed. The LLaMA series are popular and recently updated from LLaMA2 to LLaMA3. However, the impacts of the update on diagnostic performance have not been well documented.
Objective
We conducted a comparative evaluation of the diagnostic performance in differential diagnosis lists generated by LLaMA3 and LLaMA2 for case reports.
Methods
We analyzed case reports published in the American Journal of Case Reports from 2022 to 2023. After excluding nondiagnostic and pediatric cases, we input the remaining cases into LLaMA3 and LLaMA2 using the same prompt and the same adjustable parameters. Diagnostic performance was defined by whether the differential diagnosis lists included the final diagnosis. Multiple physicians independently evaluated whether the final diagnosis was included in the top 10 differentials generated by LLaMA3 and LLaMA2.
Results
In our comparative evaluation of the diagnostic performance between LLaMA3 and LLaMA2, we analyzed differential diagnosis lists for 392 case reports. The final diagnosis was included in the top 10 differentials generated by LLaMA3 in 79.6% (312/392) of the cases, compared to 49.7% (195/392) for LLaMA2, indicating a statistically significant improvement (P<.001). Additionally, LLaMA3 showed higher performance in including the final diagnosis in the top 5 differentials, observed in 63% (247/392) of cases, compared to LLaMA2’s 38% (149/392, P<.001). Furthermore, the top diagnosis was accurately identified by LLaMA3 in 33.9% (133/392) of cases, significantly higher than the 22.7% (89/392) achieved by LLaMA2 (P<.001). The analysis across various medical specialties revealed variations in diagnostic performance with LLaMA3 consistently outperforming LLaMA2.
Conclusions
The results reveal that the LLaMA3 model significantly outperforms LLaMA2 per diagnostic performance, with a higher percentage of case reports having the final diagnosis listed within the top 10, top 5, and as the top diagnosis. Overall diagnostic performance improved almost 1.5 times from LLaMA2 to LLaMA3. These findings support the rapid development and continuous refinement of generative AI systems to enhance diagnostic processes in medicine. However, these findings should be carefully interpreted for clinical application, as generative AI, including the LLaMA series, has not been approved for medical applications such as AI-enhanced diagnostics.}

Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models’ prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT’s analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former.

Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, including surveys and interviews, this research explored students’ experiences and perceptions of GenAI tools, including Grammarly and Quillbot. The findings revealed that two-thirds of the students (66.7%) regularly used these tools, which they found particularly helpful for improving grammar, writing, vocabulary, and reading skills. Interview insights indicated that the students appreciated the personalised feedback and creative support provided by GenAI tools, although they also acknowledged risks such as irrelevant feedback and potential overreliance.

abstract = {The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), powered by Transformer networks, has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, computer vision, and graphics. However, the application of Transformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing boundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep learning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models pose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric definitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete data Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous geometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed) into Bézier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without discretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method that organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens suitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological characteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer’s attention mechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of boundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature recognition tasks.}

Recognizing the inequalities that circumscribe the use of these technologies, this paper proposes materiality, indexicality, and ideology as key constructs that help develop an understanding of critical digital literacies relevant to GenAI-mediated L2 writing and digital multimodal composing. These constructs draw attention to how platform designs and other material processes, together with learner access to resources, can steer learners toward particular interactions and discourses.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) can understand natural language and generate corresponding text, images, and even videos based on prompts, which holds great potential in medical scenarios. Orthopedics is a significant branch of medicine, and orthopedic diseases contribute to a significant socioeconomic burden, which could be alleviated by the application of LLMs. Several pioneers in orthopedics have conducted research on LLMs across various subspecialties to explore their performance in addressing different issues. However, there are currently few reviews and summaries of these studies, and a systematic summary of existing research is absent.
Objective
The objective of this review was to comprehensively summarize research findings on the application of LLMs in the field of orthopedics and explore the potential opportunities and challenges.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 1, 2014, to February 22, 2024, with the language limited to English. The terms, which included variants of “large language model,” “generative artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” and “orthopaedics,” were divided into 2 categories: large language model and orthopedics. After completing the search, the study selection process was conducted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials and CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) guidance. Data extraction and synthesis were conducted after the quality assessment.
Results
A total of 68 studies were selected. The application of LLMs in orthopedics involved the fields of clinical practice, education, research, and management. Of these 68 studies, 47 (69%) focused on clinical practice, 12 (18%) addressed orthopedic education, 8 (12%) were related to scientific research, and 1 (1%) pertained to the field of management. Of the 68 studies, only 8 (12%) recruited patients, and only 1 (1%) was a high-quality randomized controlled trial. ChatGPT was the most commonly mentioned LLM tool. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition, measurement, and evaluation of the LLMs’ performance across the different studies. For diagnostic tasks alone, the accuracy ranged from 55% to 93%. When performing disease classification tasks, ChatGPT with GPT-4’s accuracy ranged from 2% to 100%. With regard to answering questions in orthopedic examinations, the scores ranged from 45% to 73.6% due to differences in models and test selections.
Conclusions
LLMs cannot replace orthopedic professionals in the short term. However, using LLMs as copilots could be a potential approach to effectively enhance work efficiency at present. More high-quality clinical trials are needed in the future, aiming to identify optimal applications of LLMs and advance orthopedics toward higher efficiency and precision.}

Current research reveals robust defensive approaches; however, there remains a significant gap in the application of Generative AI to develop advanced attack scenarios capable of bypassing existing defense mechanisms. Our work attempts to fill this gap and spreads awareness regarding a potential exposure of Neural Network (NN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) against AI-enhanced attacks. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on Input Perturbation, Data Poisoning, or Spoofing, we propose a novel offensive strategy called Attack Obfuscation. This strategy leverages Conditional GANs (CGANs) to conceal genuine attacks by injecting synthetic traffic designed to deceive NN-based IDS. The experimental investigation validates the proposed approach against three distinct datasets and different typologies of attacks, managing to successfully deceive the IDS.}

Analysis of pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, which encompassed a mix of open and closed items to gather participants’ knowledge and perceptions of utilising GenAI tools, as well as the follow-up interviews, revealed that the intervention was effective in stretching all aspects of pre-service teachers’ P-GenAI-C. While there was greater evidence of improvement in participants’ pedagogical competence and critical awareness of GenAI tools deployment, there was less evidence of development in other aspects, such as teachers’ capacity to guide their students to use GenAI tools effectively and responsibly. This discrepancy might be attributed to the lack of such content in the course intervention. Implications for incorporating elements of P-GenAI-C into teacher preparation courses and programmes are discussed.}

The insights resulting from the discussion made are materialized in a general mathematical model that leverages the discrete capacitated facility location. This lays the ground for embedding logistics decisions like distribution, inventory, procurement, and production. Different mechanisms for hedging against uncertainty are then analyzed, which ultimately lead to show how a facility location model can be set at the core of supply chain risk analytics. Environmental and social concerns aligned with the triple bottom line concept are also covered. In particular, the role of facility location in reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain design is analyzed.

These techniques, although powerful, require a high computational cost, which limits their use in real-time applications, embedded devices, and environmental monitoring systems, where computational resources are often limited. Therefore, this work presents an approach based on compact latent diffusion, where the denoising model uses attention channels and residual block operations. In addition, we evaluated different training loss functions, which help the model perform cloud removal across various land cover types. Considering a resource-constrained approach, we investigated different experimental configurations using Pareto Front to optimize the most promising experiments.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs), a natural language processing technology based on deep learning, are currently in the spotlight. These models closely mimic natural language comprehension and generation. Their evolution has undergone several waves of innovation similar to convolutional neural networks. The transformer architecture advancement in generative artificial intelligence marks a monumental leap beyond early-stage pattern recognition via supervised learning. With the expansion of parameters and training data (terabytes), LLMs unveil remarkable human interactivity, encompassing capabilities such as memory retention and comprehension. These advances make LLMs particularly well-suited for roles in healthcare communication between medical practitioners and patients. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the trajectory of LLMs and their potential implications for clinicians and patients. For clinicians, LLMs can be used for automated medical documentation, and given better inputs and extensive validation, LLMs may be able to autonomously diagnose and treat in the future. For patient care, LLMs can be used for triage suggestions, summarization of medical documents, explanation of a patient’s condition, and customizing patient education materials tailored to their comprehension level. The limitations of LLMs and possible solutions for real-world use are also presented. Given the rapid advancements in this area, this review attempts to briefly cover many roles that LLMs may play in the ophthalmic space, with a focus on improving the quality of healthcare delivery.}

abstract = {Background:
In EULAR 2020, the results of our ongoing project Reumasutra were presented. The aims were to (i) understand the complexities and the difficulties of sexuality in people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), (ii) offer a solution to the problems previously identified, and (iii) (un)validate the proposed solution using feedback of people with RMDs [1]. However, we were forced to pause the last phase of the project due to diverse challenges been the most influential the development of generative artificial intelligence and its potential use for creating deepfakes. This technology brought with it ethical challenges. Therefore, we wanted to be sure how we could best protect the dignity of the individuals who trusted us by participating in the explicit audiovisual shorts, which involved recreating adapted sexual positions for people with RMDs. While considering the best options available, we decided that the topic of sexuality and sex in RMDs was too important to be put on hold for an extended period. Therefore, we chose to expand Reumasutra by creating a documentary for people of all ages, aimed at making the taboo topic of sexuality and sex in RMDs visible and accessible to the general population.
Objectives:
To create a documentary for the general population on sexuality and sex in RMDs in order to raise awareness of this taboo topic.
Methods:
For this work, our ontological and epistemological assumptions stand by the constructivist/interpretivist paradigm which establishes that there are multiple subjective realities, each of which is socially constructed by and between individuals. The creation of the documentary was approached using qualitative research methodology and methods. Narrative interviews were used as the method of data collection. Interviews were moderated by the same researcher which was assisted by an audiovisual team in charge of recording the interviews and subsequent audiovisual editing of the final piece. A total of 10 interviews (eight with women), conducted in Catalan, Spanish, and English, took place in February 2024 in Barcelona, Spain. Seven of the interviews were with individuals with RMDs (such as axial spondylarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and pulmonary sarcoidosis, among others), and the remaining interviews were with health professionals or patient advocates. It is important to note that some of the individuals interviewed held more than one role, being both people with RMDs and healthcare professionals or patient advocates. After data collection, a qualitative content analysis was performed.
Results:
Our main result is the documentary (approximate duration of 50 minutes) in which four main topics were generated and could be appreciated in more depth. Although sexuality and sex were the primary focus of our work, the narrative interviews revealed important issues that we were previously unaware of, which may also be invisible to the general population. The four main topics are: (i) structural violence and microaggressions against women, (ii) lack of education on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within the medical community, (iii) the formation of a new identity after diagnosis, and (iv) women's bodies as factories for producing life.
Conclusion:
There is an invisibility of women in medicine. Just as sexuality and sex in RMDs are not a local problem but a global one, we believe this invisibility is also a global issue. Sociocultural variables and dynamics (e.g., religious practices) play a role in the magnitude of this issue across different countries. Structural violence and various types of aggression were identified in the experiences of the women who participated, which was not the case for the men interviewed. DEI education is needed in medical training to counterbalance this violence. New meaning in the lives of the participants was found through collective activities that created bonds with different communities. However, there is a reproductive reductionism in rheumatology when the topic of sexuality and sex is addressed with women. Our results serve as an invitation for everyone involved in the diagnosis and treatment of RMDs to reflect on our practices, their origins, and ask ourselves: Are there better ways?

abstract = {Introduction and objective
Generative artificial intelligence makes it possible to ask about medical pathologies in dialog boxes. Our objective was to analyze the quality of information about the most common urological pathologies provided by ChatGPT (OpenIA), BARD (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft).
Methods
We analyzed information on the following pathologies and their treatments as provided by AI: prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, urinary lithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Questions in English and Spanish were posed in dialog boxes; the answers were collected and analyzed with DISCERN questionnaires and the overall appropriateness of the response. Surgical procedures were performed with an informed consent questionnaire.
Results
The responses from the three chatbots explained the pathology, detailed risk factors, and described treatments. The difference is that BARD and Copilot provide external information citations, which ChatGPT does not. The highest DISCERN scores, in absolute numbers, were obtained in Copilot; however, on the appropriacy scale it was noted that their responses were not the most appropriate. The best surgical treatment scores were obtained by BARD, followed by ChatGPT, and finally Copilot.
Conclusions
The answers obtained from generative AI on urological diseases depended on the formulation of the question. The information provided had significant biases, depending on pathology, language, and above all, the dialog box consulted.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial (IA) generativa permite preguntar, a través de los cuadros de diálogo, sobre patologías médicas. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar la calidad de la información acerca de las patologías urológicas más comunes en los chatbots ChatGPT de OpenIA, BARD de Google y Copilot de Microsoft.
Material y método
Se realizó un análisis de la información aportada por IA sobre las siguientes patologías y sus tratamientos: cáncer de próstata, cáncer renal, cáncer de vejiga, litiasis urinarias e hipertrofia benigna de próstata (HBP). A través de cuadros de diálogo se formularon preguntas estructuradas en inglés y en español, recopilando las respuestas para analizarlas posteriormente con cuestionarios DISCERN y sobre la idoneidad global de la respuesta. Los tratamientos quirúrgicos se realizaron con cuestionario de consentimiento informado.
Resultados
Las respuestas obtenidas a través de los tres chatbots explicaron la patología, detallaron los factores de riesgo y describieron los tratamientos. La diferencia radica en que BARD y Copilot aportan citas de información externa, algo que ChatGPT no realiza. Las puntuaciones DISCERN más altas, en números absolutos, se obtuvieron en Copilot; sin embargo, en la escala de idoneidad se objetivó que sus respuestas no fueron las más apropiadas. Las mejores puntuaciones de tratamientos quirúrgicos fueron obtenidas por BARD, seguido de ChatGPT y finalmente de Copilot.
Conclusiones
Las respuestas obtenidas de la IA generativa sobre enfermedades urológicas dependieron de la formulación de la pregunta. La información proporcionada presentó sesgos importantes, dependiendo de la patología, del idioma y, sobre todo, del cuadro de diálogo consultado.}

Feature engineering was used to represent shear wall and beam layouts as graph data enhanced through data augmentation to improve GNN model generalization. The GraphSAGE algorithm analyzed the graph to simultaneously generate the shear wall and beam layouts followed by postprocessing for extraction and optimization based on encoded design rules. A case study validated the method, showing that intersections over union for GNN-generated layouts were 14.9 % and 35.6 % higher than those from the conventional approach. This method offers a reference for the coupled design of multiple structural attributes.}

Motivated by advances in generative artificial intelligence techniques, a data-driven diffusion generative approach using implicit surface representation for energy-absorbing metamaterial design is proposed. This approach utilizes the diffusion model to learn the conditional distribution of metamaterial based on specified mechanical properties, converting target properties into potential metamaterial topologies. Additionally, level set-based implicit surface representation ensures that the generated metamaterials have high-quality geometric shapes and clear boundary definitions, enhancing design flexibility while requiring fewer design variables. Numerical simulations and experimental results consistently verify that the proposed approach enables rapid and accurate design of metamaterials tailored to target mechanical performance. This method offers an innovative and efficient solution for the accelerated design of energy-absorbing metamaterials, providing a new perspective and approach to address complex engineering design challenges.}

abstract = {Background
Digital mental health tools, designed to augment traditional mental health treatments, are becoming increasingly important due to a wide range of barriers to accessing mental health care, including a growing shortage of clinicians. Most existing tools use rule-based algorithms, often leading to interactions that feel unnatural compared with human therapists. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution for the development of more natural, engaging digital tools. In this paper, we detail the development of Socrates 2.0, which was designed to engage users in Socratic dialogue surrounding unrealistic or unhelpful beliefs, a core technique in cognitive behavioral therapies. The multiagent LLM-based tool features an artificial intelligence (AI) therapist, Socrates, which receives automated feedback from an AI supervisor and an AI rater. The combination of multiple agents appeared to help address common LLM issues such as looping, and it improved the overall dialogue experience. Initial user feedback from individuals with lived experiences of mental health problems as well as cognitive behavioral therapists has been positive. Moreover, tests in approximately 500 scenarios showed that Socrates 2.0 engaged in harmful responses in under 1% of cases, with the AI supervisor promptly correcting the dialogue each time. However, formal feasibility studies with potential end users are needed.
Objective
This mixed methods study examines the feasibility of Socrates 2.0.
Methods
On the basis of the initial data, we devised a formal feasibility study of Socrates 2.0 to gather qualitative and quantitative data about users’ and clinicians’ experience of interacting with the tool. Using a mixed method approach, the goal is to gather feasibility and acceptability data from 100 users and 50 clinicians to inform the eventual implementation of generative AI tools, such as Socrates 2.0, in mental health treatment. We designed this study to better understand how users and clinicians interact with the tool, including the frequency, length, and time of interactions, users’ satisfaction with the tool overall, quality of each dialogue and individual responses, as well as ways in which the tool should be improved before it is used in efficacy trials. Descriptive and inferential analyses will be performed on data from validated usability measures. Thematic analysis will be performed on the qualitative data.
Results
Recruitment will begin in February 2024 and is expected to conclude by February 2025. As of September 25, 2024, overall, 55 participants have been recruited.
Conclusions
The development of Socrates 2.0 and the outlined feasibility study are important first steps in applying generative AI to mental health treatment delivery and lay the foundation for formal feasibility studies.

To this end, we propose the Edge Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (EdgeAIGC) framework, which can effectively solve the problems brought by cloud computing by implementing in-situ processing of services close to the data source through edge computing. However, AIGC models usually have a large parameter scale and complex computing requirements, which poses a huge challenge to the storage and computing resources of edge devices. This paper focuses on the edge intelligence model caching and resource allocation problems in the EdgeAIGC framework, aiming to improve the cache hit rate and resource utilization of edge devices for models by optimizing the model caching strategy and resource allocation scheme, and realize in-situ AIGC service processing. With the optimization objectives of minimizing service request response time and execution cost in resource-constrained environments, we employ the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm for optimization. Experimental results show that, compared with other methods, our model caching and resource allocation strategies can effectively improve the cache hit rate by at least 41.06% and reduce the response cost.}

The need for evidence-based studies and a standardized approach to scientific medicine aligns well with these applications. AI can leave a lasting impact on the Chinese medicine (CM) landscape by increasing expectations and presenting new challenges. The analogy between the CM-specific diagnostic methods and syndrome differentiation, which is holistic, pattern-oriented, patient-centered, and clinical data analysis, is significant at multiple levels. These qualities pose challenges for AI usage in CM, which heavily relies on structured data and pattern recognition. Despite these adversities, AI can still be used in CM through data standardization, prediction formulation, and treatment planning, provided that the integration of this tool considers the primary principles of CM and adheres to ethical and regulatory considerations. This review examines the dichotomous approach to health and medicine in the contexts of AI and CM, highlighting the evolving potential, inherent limitations, and ethical and regulatory issues associated with the application of AI to CM.

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence is becoming a part of daily life and the medical field. Generative artificial intelligence models, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, are experiencing a surge in popularity due to their enhanced performance and reliability. However, the application of these models in specialized domains, such as occupational medicine, remains largely unexplored.
Objective
This study aims to assess the potential suitability of a generative large language model, such as ChatGPT, as a support tool for medical research and even clinical decisions in occupational medicine in Germany.
Methods
In this randomized controlled study, the usability of ChatGPT for medical research and clinical decision-making was investigated using a web application developed for this purpose. Eligibility criteria were being a physician or medical student. Participants (N=56) were asked to work on 3 cases of occupational lung diseases and answer case-related questions. They were allocated via coin weighted for proportions of physicians in each group into 2 groups. One group researched the cases using an integrated chat application similar to ChatGPT based on the latest GPT-4-Turbo model, while the other used their usual research methods, such as Google, Amboss, or DocCheck. The primary outcome was case performance based on correct answers, while secondary outcomes included changes in specific question accuracy and self-assessed occupational medicine expertise before and after case processing. Group assignment was not traditionally blinded, as the chat window indicated membership; participants only knew the study examined web-based research, not group specifics.
Results
Participants of the ChatGPT group (n=27) showed better performance in specific research, for example, for potentially hazardous substances or activities (eg, case 1: ChatGPT group 2.5 hazardous substances that cause pleural changes versus 1.8 in a group with own research; P=.01; Cohen r=–0.38), and led to an increase in self-assessment with regard to specialist knowledge (from 3.9 to 3.4 in the ChatGPT group vs from 3.5 to 3.4 in the own research group; German school grades between 1=very good and 6=unsatisfactory; P=.047). However, clinical decisions, for example, whether an occupational disease report should be filed, were more often made correctly as a result of the participant’s own research (n=29; eg, case 1: Should an occupational disease report be filed? Yes for 7 participants in the ChatGPT group vs 14 in their own research group; P=.007; odds ratio 6.00, 95% CI 1.54‐23.36).
Conclusions
ChatGPT can be a useful tool for targeted medical research, even for rather specific questions in occupational medicine regarding occupational diseases. However, clinical decisions should currently only be supported and not made by the large language model. Future systems should be critically assessed, even if the initial results are promising.

abstract = {Background
The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, has added complexity and richness to the virtual environment by increasing the presence of AI-generated content (AIGC). Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.
Objective
This study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.
Methods
The study conducted a 2×2×2 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.
Results
As of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.
Conclusions
This study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users’ perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation. This highlights the need for more nuanced strategies for AIGC labels, necessitating further research.}

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, is increasingly utilized to facilitate decision-making processes in various aspects of our lives, including travel activities. Despite its growing adoption in the travel service industry, a research gap focusing on the innovation characteristics of ChatGPT, customer adoption, and word-of-mouth (WOM) remains. By utilizing stringent methodologies through variable- and case-based approaches, this study explores the influence of ChatGPT innovation characteristics and customer adoption factors in inducing WOM. The formal set-theoretic approach further explores the intersections between the empirical model, theory, and outcome (WOM). The results provide novel insights into customer WOM for generative AI, examining whether innovation attributes, such as relative benefits, complexity and compatibility, and/or states of customer adoption factors -- particularly in terms of cognitive, affective, and behavioral response individually or in combination -- contribute to WOM, thereby leading to theoretical and practical implications in the hospitality and tourism industry.}

This study examines the accuracy and methodological implications of using LLMs to classify open-ended responses from learners. We surveyed 143 Japanese university students studying English as a foreign language (EFL) about their essay-writing process. Two human evaluators independently classified the students’ responses based on self-regulated learning processes: planning, monitoring, and evaluation. At the same time, several LLMs performed the same classification task, and their results were compared with those of the human evaluators using Cohen’s kappa coefficient. We established κ ≥ 0.8 as the threshold for strong agreement based on rigorous methodological standards. Our findings revealed that even the best-performing model (DeepSeek-V3) achieved only moderate agreement (κ = 0.68), while other models demonstrated fair-to-moderate agreement (κ = 0.37–0.61). Surprisingly, open-source models outperformed several commercial counterparts. These results highlight the necessity of expert oversight when integrating GenAI as a support tool in qualitative data analysis. The paper concludes by discussing the methodological implications for using LLMs in qualitative research and proposing specific prompt engineering strategies to enhance their reliability in applied linguistics.}

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the feasibility, usability, and efficacy of innovative generative pretrained transformer chatbot in improving self-care in hypertensive patients in a resource-limited setting.
Patients and Methods
A single-arm nonblinded clinical trial was deployed in a busy cardiology clinic in a low-resource setting. Artificial intelligence–enabled chatbot (Healthy Heart Assistant) was activated in smartphones of 50 adults on treatment for hypertension. Participants were trained on how to use the Healthy Heart Assistant including setting medication and appointment reminders. Baseline questionnaires were administered at enrollment and 30 days later to explore acceptability, feasibility and usability of the bot. We used chatbot usability questionnaire and self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire to assess bot usability and patients’ satisfaction, respectively. The study began on April 5, 2024, through July 15, 2024.
Results
Of 200 hypertensive clinic attendees, 70 (35%) had internet-enabled bot-compatible cell phones, of which 50 hypertensive patients were recruited to participate in the study. Among 50 participants, 2 (4%) were lost to follow-up; 19 (39.6%) were women; and 40 (83.3%) had attained tertiary level of education. Mean time of training to use bot was 5.7 minutes, with 35 (70.8%) of participants being able to use the bot within 5 minutes. The median frequency of chats for participants within the timeframe was an average of 1.5 chats/day. Chatbot usability questionnaire score was 69.5%, whereas self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire score was 90%.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study shows that generative artificial intelligence can be applied with reasonable success in hypertension self-care in low-resource settings and has potential for being effective.}

Throughout seven-week's instruction, quantitative data were collected with pre- and post-questionnaires of writing self-efficacy and critical thinking ability. The results revealed no statistical difference in terms of both critical thinking ability and writing self-efficacy even with greater increase among the experimental group than that of the control peers.

The research contributes valuable empirical evidence of incorporating generative AI chatbots into L2 writing by extending the Cognitive Load Theory and Social Cognitive Theory. It also underscores the need to leveraging AI chatbots as tools for cognitive transformation rather than mere procedural assistance, and relevant training programs are essential to optimize the educational benefits of AI tools and cultivate digital literacy among vocational college learners.}

Here, a transdisciplinary group of code scientists attempts to capture the big picture of code research across their fields of interest. In this cross-sectional overview commonalities emerge that may pave the way towards a unified theory of life-based-on-codes. Codes underly cellular processes, perception, cognition, and communication. From ecosystems to human language, codes influence how individuals behave in groups, memorize, learn, and take part in cultural practices. Emotions like aggression, fear, anger, frustration, are important motivators of behaviour modulating mutual communication and sculpting individual experience. The inheritance of experience in form of innate release mechanisms, stereotyped behaviour, or archetypes may have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots that rely on codes and impact our conscious decision making. Unconsciously, even our dreams draw on codes. In the future, conflation of different coding systems, e.g., from synthetic biology and generative artificial intelligence, will merge biological codes with machine logic and computer language to promote next-level transhumanism. Codes emerge as a currency converter between systems of life and between different scientific disciplines.}

However, limited attention has been paid to understanding how GenAI brands can sustain their business in this highly dynamic and fiercely competitive GenAI market. To fill this gap, the present study investigated the role of brand anthropomorphism attributes in influencing brand respect and brand heroes. A sample of 315 consumers of GenAI applications was recruited from two countries: the United States of America (n = 167) and the United Kingdom (n = 148). Psychometric properties were validated via confirmatory factor analysis, and hypotheses were tested using PLS-SEM with SmartPLS 4.0. In addition, the present study conducted an importance-performance map analysis to complement the structural analysis. Findings revealed that moral virtue, cognitive experience and appearance attributes of brand anthropomorphism enhance brand respect. Whereas moral virtue, appearance and conscious emotionality attributes of brand anthropomorphism positively influence brand hero. Respondents’ age significantly moderates some of the proposed relationships while gender does not exhibit a significant influence. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications are also discussed.}

However, not only design parameters but also additive manufacturing (AM) process parameters affect the mechanical properties of additively manufactured materials. To address this issue, we introduce an auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN)-based computational framework that generates both design and AM process parameters to fabricate lattice structures with target mechanical performance. The computational framework consists of two ACGAN models, including a generative model called InverseACGAN and a forward predictive model called ForwardACGAN. The generative model generates critical design parameters of the lattice structures, including line distance, layer height, and infill pattern, as well as AM process parameters, including print speed and print temperature, based on target mechanical properties (i.e., porosity and compressive modulus). The forward predictive model predicts the mechanical properties of the lattice structures generated by the generative model. The experimental results show that the porosity and compressive modulus of the lattice structures designed by ACGAN are in good agreement with the target porosity and compressive modulus. The average mean absolute percentage errors between target and actual porosity, and target and actual compressive modulus are 6.481% and 10.208%, respectively.}

abstract = {Background
Reading medical papers is a challenging and time-consuming task for doctors, especially when the papers are long and complex. A tool that can help doctors efficiently process and understand medical papers is needed.
Objective
This study aims to critically assess and compare the comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in accurately and efficiently understanding medical research papers using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist, which provides a standardized framework for evaluating key elements of observational study.
Methods
The study is a methodological type of research. The study aims to evaluate the understanding capabilities of new generative artificial intelligence tools in medical papers. A novel benchmark pipeline processed 50 medical research papers from PubMed, comparing the answers of 6 LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-1106, PaLM 2, Claude v1, and Gemini Pro) to the benchmark established by expert medical professors. Fifteen questions, derived from the STROBE checklist, assessed LLMs’ understanding of different sections of a research paper.
Results
LLMs exhibited varying performance, with GPT-3.5-Turbo achieving the highest percentage of correct answers (n=3916, 66.9%), followed by GPT-4-1106 (n=3837, 65.6%), PaLM 2 (n=3632, 62.1%), Claude v1 (n=2887, 58.3%), Gemini Pro (n=2878, 49.2%), and GPT-4-0613 (n=2580, 44.1%). Statistical analysis revealed statistically significant differences between LLMs (P<.001), with older models showing inconsistent performance compared to newer versions. LLMs showcased distinct performances for each question across different parts of a scholarly paper—with certain models like PaLM 2 and GPT-3.5 showing remarkable versatility and depth in understanding.
Conclusions
This study is the first to evaluate the performance of different LLMs in understanding medical papers using the retrieval augmented generation method. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance medical research by improving efficiency and facilitating evidence-based decision-making. Further research is needed to address limitations such as the influence of question formats, potential biases, and the rapid evolution of LLM models.}

The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models including OpenAI's ChatGPT signals a promising era for medical research. In this Viewpoint, we explore the integration and challenges of large language models (LLMs) in digital pathology, a rapidly evolving domain demanding intricate contextual understanding. The restricted domain-specific efficiency of LLMs necessitates the advent of tailored AI tools, as illustrated by advancements seen in the last few years including FrugalGPT and BioBERT. Our initiative in digital pathology emphasises the potential of domain-specific AI tools, where a curated literature database coupled with a user-interactive web application facilitates precise, referenced information retrieval. Motivated by the success of this initiative, we discuss how domain-specific approaches substantially minimise the risk of inaccurate responses, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of information extraction. We also highlight the broader implications of such tools, particularly in streamlining access to scientific research and democratising access to computational pathology techniques for scientists with little coding experience. This Viewpoint calls for an enhanced integration of domain-specific text-generation AI tools in academic settings to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation to the dynamically evolving landscape of medical research.}

The increasing application of generative artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) in various fields, including dentistry, raises questions about their accuracy.
Objective
This study aims to comparatively evaluate the answers provided by 4 LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bing Chat (Microsoft Corp), to clinically relevant questions from the field of dentistry.
Methods
The LLMs were queried with 20 open-type, clinical dentistry–related questions from different disciplines, developed by the respective faculty of the School of Dentistry, European University Cyprus. The LLMs’ answers were graded 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) points against strong, traditionally collected scientific evidence, such as guidelines and consensus statements, using a rubric, as if they were examination questions posed to students, by 2 experienced faculty members. The scores were statistically compared to identify the best-performing model using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Moreover, the evaluators were asked to provide a qualitative evaluation of the comprehensiveness, scientific accuracy, clarity, and relevance of the LLMs’ answers.
Results
Overall, no statistically significant difference was detected between the scores given by the 2 evaluators; therefore, an average score was computed for every LLM. Although ChatGPT-4 statistically outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (P=.008), Bing Chat (P=.049), and Bard (P=.045), all models occasionally exhibited inaccuracies, generality, outdated content, and a lack of source references. The evaluators noted instances where the LLMs delivered irrelevant information, vague answers, or information that was not fully accurate.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that although LLMs hold promising potential as an aid in the implementation of evidence-based dentistry, their current limitations can lead to potentially harmful health care decisions if not used judiciously. Therefore, these tools should not replace the dentist’s critical thinking and in-depth understanding of the subject matter. Further research, clinical validation, and model improvements are necessary for these tools to be fully integrated into dental practice. Dental practitioners must be aware of the limitations of LLMs, as their imprudent use could potentially impact patient care. Regulatory measures should be established to oversee the use of these evolving technologies.}

abstract = {Background
The past decade has witnessed a surge in the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology systems for healthcare. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an AI-based Chatbot, is being utilized in nursing education, research and practice. However, little is known about its pattern of usage, which prompted this study.
Objective
To provide a concise overview of the existing literature on the application of ChatGPT in nursing education, practice and research.
Methods
A rapid review based on the Cochrane methodology was applied to synthesize existing literature. We conducted systematic searches in several databases, including CINAHL, Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Education Search Complete, ERIC, and Cochrane CENTRAL, to ensure no publications were missed. All types of primary and secondary research studies, including qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, and literature reviews published in the English language focused on the use of ChatGPT in nursing education, research, and practice, were included. Dissertations or theses, conference proceedings, government and other organizational reports, white papers, discussion papers, opinion pieces, editorials, commentaries, and published review protocols were excluded. Studies involving other healthcare professionals and/or students without including nursing participants were excluded. Studies exploring other language models without comparison to ChatGPT and those examining the technical specifications of ChatGPT were excluded. Data screening was completed in two stages: titles and abstract and full-text review, followed by data extraction and quality appraisal. Descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were applied to summarize and categorize the findings.
Results
Seventeen studies were included: 15 (88.2 %) focused on nursing education and one each on nursing practice and research. Of the 17 included studies, 5 (29.4 %) were evaluation studies, 3 (17.6 %) were narrative reviews, 3 (17.6 %) were cross-sectional studies, 2 (11.8 %) were descriptive studies, and 1 (5.9 %) was a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental study, case study, and qualitative study, respectively.
Conclusion
This study has provided a snapshot of ChatGPT usage in nursing education, research, and practice. Although evidence is inconclusive, integration of ChatGPT should consider addressing ethical concerns and ongoing education on ChatGPT usage. Further research, specifically interventional studies, is recommended to ascertain and track the impact of ChatGPT in different contexts.}

This study explores how English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writers engage with ChatGPT feedback by analyzing their revision behaviors and perceptions of its effectiveness in revising their opinion essays. Using a convergent parallel mixed methods design, the study involved 25 B1-level EFL students from a university in Türkiye. Data were collected through essay drafts, change tracker sheets, a questionnaire, and interviews. The descriptive and thematic analysis of essays, change tracker sheets, and interviews revealed that most content and language feedback was accepted, while organization feedback received mixed engagement of acceptance and rejection. Students were more likely to accept language use feedback than content or organization feedback, often incorporating ChatGPT's revisions directly. For content feedback, the most common revision operations were additions and substitutions while more than a third of the revisions in response to organization feedback involved no corrections. Correction was the most frequent revision operation for language use feedback. Questionnaire and interview analyses further revealed that while ChatGPT feedback was generally well-received and considered beneficial for writing improvement, students faced challenges related to feedback length, specificity, advanced language, and misunderstandings. This study provides valuable insights into how EFL students interact with ChatGPT-generated feedback, highlighting both its potential to support L2 writing development and the challenges that may limit its effectiveness.}

This study employed dual-system theory to examine the cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underpinning addictive ChatGPT use, positioning self-construal as a key antecedent and cognitive miserliness as a critical consequence. We adopted a mixed-methods approach for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis. Three cross-sectional surveys revealed that heightened activity in the impulsive cognitive system was a significant predictor of addictive ChatGPT use. Moreover, a dysregulation between the impulsive and reflective cognitive systems exacerbated compulsive tendencies and facilitated cognitive miserliness. Self-construal also affected these effects: individuals with an independent orientation were more likely to rely on the impulsive cognitive system, while those with an interdependent orientation engaged the reflective cognitive system more frequently. Notably, the reflective cognitive system often failed to adequately inhibit addictive ChatGPT use. Qualitative insights supported these findings and offered a deeper understanding of users’ behavioral patterns. This study contributes to theoretical discourse on the adverse cognitive impact of GenAI use, and informs managers seeking to design interventions that promote healthier digital engagement.}

abstract = {Background
Recent surveys indicate that 48% of consumers actively use generative artificial intelligence (AI) for health-related inquiries. Despite widespread adoption and the potential to improve health care access, scant research examines the performance of AI chatbot responses regarding emergency care advice.
Objective
We assessed the quality of AI chatbot responses to common emergency care questions. We sought to determine qualitative differences in responses from 4 free-access AI chatbots, for 10 different serious and benign emergency conditions.
Methods
We created 10 emergency care questions that we fed into the free-access versions of ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI), Google Bard, Bing AI Chat (Microsoft), and Claude AI (Anthropic) on November 26, 2023. Each response was graded by 5 board-certified emergency medicine (EM) faculty for 8 domains of percentage accuracy, presence of dangerous information, factual accuracy, clarity, completeness, understandability, source reliability, and source relevancy. We determined the correct, complete response to the 10 questions from reputable and scholarly emergency medical references. These were compiled by an EM resident physician. For the readability of the chatbot responses, we used the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of each response from readability statistics embedded in Microsoft Word. Differences between chatbots were determined by the chi-square test.
Results
Each of the 4 chatbots’ responses to the 10 clinical questions were scored across 8 domains by 5 EM faculty, for 400 assessments for each chatbot. Together, the 4 chatbots had the best performance in clarity and understandability (both 85%), intermediate performance in accuracy and completeness (both 50%), and poor performance (10%) for source relevance and reliability (mostly unreported). Chatbots contained dangerous information in 5% to 35% of responses, with no statistical difference between chatbots on this metric (P=.24). ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Claud AI had similar performances across 6 out of 8 domains. Only Bing AI performed better with more identified or relevant sources (40%; the others had 0%-10%). Flesch-Kincaid Reading level was 7.7-8.9 grade for all chatbots, except ChatGPT at 10.8, which were all too advanced for average emergency patients. Responses included both dangerous (eg, starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation with no pulse check) and generally inappropriate advice (eg, loosening the collar to improve breathing without evidence of airway compromise).
Conclusions
AI chatbots, though ubiquitous, have significant deficiencies in EM patient advice, despite relatively consistent performance. Information for when to seek urgent or emergent care is frequently incomplete and inaccurate, and patients may be unaware of misinformation. Sources are not generally provided. Patients who use AI to guide health care decisions assume potential risks. AI chatbots for health should be subject to further research, refinement, and regulation. We strongly recommend proper medical consultation to prevent potential adverse outcomes.}

However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become prominent in healthcare, particularly as an oncology aid in clinical documentation, which has implications for treatment decisions.1 National guidelines favor synoptic reporting of prostate biopsy specimens to aid in proper risk stratification of prostate cancer (PCa).2;Thus, AI is a potential tool to analyze synoptic reports and reduce the variation in algorithmic risk stratification. We questioned whether a trained AI model could review pathology reports, along with clinical vignettes, for PCa to provide an accurate risk assessment and recommendations.1. Sorin, V, Barash, Y, Konin, E., et al.. Deep-learning natural language processing for oncological applications. The Lancet Oncology. 2020 Dec 2020;21(12)doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30615-X2. https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/prostate_blocks.pdf
Methods
Retrospective review of localized PCa patients from January 2022 – January 2023 was performed. Following initial prostate biopsy, all patients were consulted and risk stratified based on NCCN guidelines by a urologic oncologist. We provided a generative AI model, ChatGPT3, the PCa risk stratification algorithm from NCCN Version 1.2023. Then queried the model to ensure accurate recall of the algorithm rules. Clinical features (PSA, cT stage) and histologic features (synoptic path report) from each case were provided and the model was prompted to “risk stratify the following patient.” In addition, we requested additional evaluation (ex: imaging) and initial therapy recommendations were also queried. 10 patients from each NCCN risk category were reviewed.3. ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com
Results
60 patients were reviewed. The generative AI model correctly risk stratified 39/60 patients (65.0%). The AI model incorrectly risk stratified 21/60 patients, however, it did assign them to an adjacent risk group (Figure 1).; Notably, 14/20 patients were correctly assigned as intermediate risk group, but the model required further prompting for categorization into favorable or unfavorable risk. Once prompted, only 12/20 were correctly risk stratified (Figure 1). Finally, when queried, the model was able to recommend treatment and imaging modalities appropriate to the stated risk group (ex: very low risk favor active surveillance, and high risk required imaging).
Conclusions
Generative AI demonstrated poor performance in algorithmic risk stratification using standardized synoptic reports. The implications of inaccurate assessments need to be considered as more healthcare professionals and systems look to incorporating generative AI into clinical tools. A healthy amount of skepticism and close review is needed to vet any clinical tool. Ultimately when it comes to the nuance of the PCa, a trained provider is still needed to interpret the information and recommendations in line with the patient's goals and preferences.}

abstract = {Background
Training in social-verbal interactions is crucial for medical first responders (MFRs) to assess a patient’s condition and perform urgent treatment during emergency medical service administration. Integrating conversational agents (CAs) in virtual patients (VPs), that is, digital simulations, is a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive human role-playing. There is moderate evidence that CAs improve communication skills more effectively when used with instructional interventions. However, more recent GPT-based artificial intelligence (AI) produces richer, more diverse, and more natural responses than previous CAs and has control of prosodic voice qualities like pitch and duration. These functionalities have the potential to better match the interaction expectations of MFRs regarding habitability.
Objective
We aimed to study how the integration of GPT-based AI in a mixed reality (MR)–VP could support communication training of MFRs.
Methods
We developed an MR simulation of a traffic accident with a VP. ChatGPT (OpenAI) was integrated into the VP and prompted with verified characteristics of accident victims. MFRs (N=24) were instructed on how to interact with the MR scenario. After assessing and treating the VP, the MFRs were administered the Mean Opinion Scale-Expanded, version 2, and the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces questionnaires to study their perception of the voice quality and the usability of the voice interactions, respectively. Open-ended questions were asked after completing the questionnaires. The observed and logged interactions with the VP, descriptive statistics of the questionnaires, and the output of the open-ended questions are reported.
Results
The usability assessment of the VP resulted in moderate positive ratings, especially in habitability (median 4.25, IQR 4-4.81) and likeability (median 4.50, IQR 3.97-5.91). Interactions were negatively affected by the approximately 3-second latency of the responses. MFRs acknowledged the naturalness of determining the physiological states of the VP through verbal communication, for example, with questions such as “Where does it hurt?” However, the question-answer dynamic in the verbal exchange with the VP and the lack of the VP’s ability to start the verbal exchange were noticed. Noteworthy insights highlighted the potential of domain-knowledge prompt engineering to steer the actions of MFRs for effective training.
Conclusions
Generative AI in VPs facilitates MFRs’ training but continues to rely on instructions for effective verbal interactions. Therefore, the capabilities of the GPT-VP and a training protocol need to be communicated to trainees. Future interactions should implement triggers based on keyword recognition, the VP pointing to the hurting area, conversational turn-taking techniques, and add the ability for the VP to start a verbal exchange. Furthermore, a local AI server, chunk processing, and lowering the audio resolution of the VP’s voice could ameliorate the delay in response and allay privacy concerns. Prompting could be used in future studies to create a virtual MFR capable of assisting trainees.}

abstract = {This study was motivated by the limited research on the adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in the workplace. Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, we developed a model to assess the factors influencing decision-makers' intention to adopt GenAI as a substitute for entry-level jobs in financial institutions. To test the hypotheses, we collected survey data from 335 respondents in Malaysian financial institutions and analyzed it using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that trust in GenAI significantly affects decision-makers' intention to adopt it as an alternative solution to human positions. Trust, in turn, was found to be positively influenced by constructs from the Theory of Effective Use (transparent interaction, informed action, and representational fidelity) as well as AI literacy, which reflects users' ability to evaluate and interact with AI. The results also show that personality traits, particularly conscientiousness, moderate the relationship between trust and adoption intention, highlighting the importance of individual differences in GenAI usage. Collectively, our findings extend the S-O-R framework by revealing how both cognitive and affective factors shape GenAI adoption behavior. The study also offers practical implications for GenAI stakeholders, especially about the vital role of trust-building strategies in fostering AI adoption.}

abstract = {Given the constantly increasing number of newly published vulnerabilities, manually assessing their scores (e.g., under the Common Vulnerability Scoring System) has become unfeasible. Recently, learning-based systems have been proposed to automatically predict vulnerability scores. Such systems use vulnerability indexing databases to train deep learning algorithms. However, their practical applicability has important limitations, including a high dependency on the quality and diversity of training data, and high computational requirements. In addition, vulnerability descriptions often do not follow the standard templates and are not rich enough with respect to the expected features. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that takes advantage of both generative artificial intelligence and lightweight deep learning techniques to provide an efficient and effective solution for automated vulnerability scoring. Data extracted from the National Vulnerability Dataset is fed into a large language model layer, whose output (i.e., an augmented dataset) is then used in a lightweight fine-tuned BERTsmall layer. We provide the results of an extensive experimental assessment of the effect of both each layer of the architecture and end-to-end performances. The results suggest that the combination of GPT3.5-Turbo and BERTsmall provides the most effective accuracy-time trade-off. We also compare the performance of the proposed architecture with other LLMs, BERT models, and cutting-edge approaches. The results show good improvements in prediction quality also when compared to a recent technique that incorporates data from 66 different sources, including the NVD.}

abstract = {The increasing demand for population-wide genomic screening and the limited availability of genetic counseling resources have created a pressing need for innovative service delivery models. Chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in genomic services, particularly in pretest counseling, but their application in returning positive population-wide genomic screening results remains underexplored. Leveraging advanced LLMs like GPT-4 offers an opportunity to address this gap by delivering accurate, contextual, and user-centered communication to individuals receiving positive genetic test results. This project aimed to design, implement, and evaluate a chatbot integrated with GPT-4, tailored to support the return of positive genomic screening results in the context of South Carolina’s In Our DNA SC program. This initiative offers free genetic screening to 100,000 individuals, with over 33,000 results returned and numerous positive findings for conditions such as Lynch syndrome, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, and familial hypercholesterolemia. A 3-step prompt engineering process using retrieval-augmented generation and few-shot techniques was used to create the chatbot. Training materials included patient frequently asked questions, genetic counseling scripts, and patient-derived queries. The chatbot underwent iterative refinement based on 13 training questions, while performance was evaluated through expert ratings on responses to 2 hypothetical patient scenarios. The 2 scenarios were intended to represent common but distinct patient profiles in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, age, and background knowledge. Domain experts rated the chatbot using a 5-point Likert scale across 8 predefined criteria: tone, clarity, program accuracy, domain accuracy, robustness, efficiency, boundaries, and usability. The chatbot achieved an average score of 3.86 (SD 0.89) across all evaluation metrics. The highest-rated criteria were tone (mean 4.25, SD 0.71) and usability (mean 4.25, SD 0.58), reflecting the chatbot’s ability to communicate effectively and provide a seamless user experience. Boundary management (mean 4.0, SD 0.76) and efficiency (mean 3.88, SD 1.08) also scored well, while clarity and robustness received ratings of 3.81 (SD 1.05) and 3.81 (SD 0.66), respectively. Domain accuracy was rated 3.63 (SD 0.96), indicating satisfactory performance in delivering genetic information, whereas program accuracy received the lowest score of 3.25 (SD 1.39), highlighting the need for improvements in delivering program-specific details. This project demonstrates the feasibility of using LLM-powered chatbots to support the return of positive genomic screening results. The chatbot effectively handled open-ended patient queries, maintained conversational boundaries, and delivered user-friendly responses. However, enhancements in program-specific accuracy are essential to maximize its utility. Future research will explore hybrid chatbot designs that combine the strengths of LLMs with rule-based components to improve scalability, accuracy, and accessibility in genomic service delivery. The findings underscore the potential of generative artificial intelligence tools to address resource limitations and improve the accessibility of genomic health care services.}

Processing capabilities have evolved from text only to being multimodal including text, images, audio, and video features. In health care settings, LLMs are being applied to several clinically important areas, including patient care and workflow efficiency, communications, hospital operations and data management, medical education, practice management, and health care research. Under the umbrella of patient care, several core use cases of LLMs include simplifying documentation tasks, enhancing patient communication (interactive language and written), conveying medical knowledge, and performing medical triage and diagnosis. However, LLMs warrant scrutiny when applied to health care tasks, as errors may have negative implications for health care outcomes, specifically in the context of perpetuating bias, ethical considerations, and cost-effectiveness. Customized LLMs developed for more narrow purposes may help overcome certain performance limitations, transparency challenges, and biases present in contemporary generalized LLMs by curating training data. Methods of customizing LLMs broadly fall under 4 categories: prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, fine-tuning, and agentic augmentation, with each approach conferring different information-retrieval properties for the LLM.

Understanding the value co-creation process between human consumers and GAI robot assistants is critical for the broader adoption of such technologies. This study seeks to investigate the psychological mechanisms and antecedent factors that underlie the human–AI value co-creation process, which has received limited attention in the literature. Accordingly, a theoretical model based on the Autonomy Competence Relatedness (ACR) model and Mind Perception Theory (MPT) is developed to examine the technological features and psychological factors that promote value co-creation. A survey was conducted in Singapore and collected 607 responses, which were analysed through covariance-based structural equation modelling. Survey results reveal that GAI robot assistant features (i.e., sensing autonomy, thought autonomy, action autonomy, personalisation, anthropomorphism, and interactivity) positively impact value co-creation through the mediation of consumers' psychological motivations, including perceived autonomy, competence, warmth, and relatedness satisfactions. By extending the ACR model with MPT, this study enhances the literature on human-GAI interactions, offering a novel understanding of the psychological factors driving value co-creation in human-centred GAI applications.}

abstract = {Background
As a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, radiology reports are immediately released to patients. However, these reports are often too complex for the lay patient, potentially leading to stress and anxiety. While solutions such as patient portals or providing radiologist contact information have been proposed in the past, new generative artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT and Google Gemini may provide the most accessible and scalable method of simplifying radiology reports for patients. Here, we gather the opinions of radiologists regarding this possibility.
Methods
An eight-question survey was sent out to all diagnostic/interventional radiology attendings and clinical fellows at our large academic medical center.
Results
From our survey (N = 52), 52.8 % of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that patients should have immediate access to their radiology reports. Only 9.61 % agreed that radiology reports are understandable by the lay patient. Regarding potential avenues to improve patient comprehension of their radiology reports, using artificial intelligence to simplify reports with a manual check by radiologists garnered the most support/strong support (46.2 %). Support of artificial intelligence generated simplifications dropped to (23.1 %) without a manual check.
Conclusion
Patients are increasingly gaining access to their radiology reports, but reports may be too complex for the lay patient. Eventually, artificial intelligence systems may help simplify radiology reports for patients, but there is currently limited support from radiologists.}
