abstract = {This article aims to introduce emerging measurement domains made feasible through the electronic health record (EHR) use metadata, to inform the changing landscape of health care delivery. We reviewed emerging domains in which EHR metadata may be used to measure health care delivery, outlining a framework for evaluating measures based on desirability, feasibility, and viability. We argue that EHR use metadata may be leveraged to develop and operationalize novel measures in the domains of team structure and dynamics, workflows, and cognitive environment to provide a clearer understanding of modern health care delivery. Examples of measures feasible using metadata include quantification of teamwork and collaboration, patient continuity measures, workflow conformity measures, and attention switching. By enabling measures that can be used to inform the next generation of health care delivery, EHR metadata may be used to improve the quality of patient care and support clinician well-being. Careful attention is needed to ensure that these measures are desirable, feasible, and viable.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses to seek viable ways to validate the application of blockchain within their specific use cases. Blockchain decision schemes (BDSs) can assist in this decision-making process, offering a potentially more cost-effective alternative to domain experts. Flow chart blockchain decision schemes (FC-BDSs) constitute 77.5% of all BDSs, and this paper systematically reviews these by standardising and aggregating the most prominent schemes into an open-source package. Central to our approach is the definition of an FC-BDS as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Upon this mathematical foundation, we engage in a meticulous exploration and analysis of various elements within FC-BDSs. We present an in-depth analysis of the structure of FC-BDSs, exploring features such as vertex count, question categorisation, and outcome distribution. Notably, the majority of FC-BDS questions ask about data and participation (34.1%) above other domains such as security (18.6%) and performance (10.8%). Observations regarding outcomes shows an overall balance in suggesting the usage or avoidance of blockchains; however, there is a discrepancy between the average questions required to reach these outcomes, revealing potential biases within schemes. Further analysis using similarity metrics (based on both structural and semantic features) identifies significant overlaps between FC-BDSs, with some schemes showing over 90% similarity. These observations could be attributed to a more informal publishing routine for FC-BDSs, and help trace the evolution of FC-BDSs over time. The insights drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the broader BDSs landscape, and stand to make significant strides towards the standardisation of FC-BDSs, thereby promoting a more coherent and effective utilisation of these decision-making tools in the realm of blockchain technology application.}

abstract = {Background
As a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, radiology reports are immediately released to patients. We determine if readers of radiology reports, via electronic health records (EHRs), and radiology report complexity have changed post the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act.
Methods
A retrospective observational study was used to analyze 10,000 radiology reports (equal split of CT, mammogram, MRI, X-ray, and ultrasound modalities) per year between 2013 and 2023. Readability was calculated through reading grade level indices.
Results
Patient viewership of their radiology reports via EHRs increased from 3.3 % (95 % CI: 3.0 %–3.7 %) in 2013 to 58.2 % (95 % CI: 57.3 %–59.2 %) in 2023. Once the 21st Century Cures Act's Information Blocking Provision went into effect, there was a significant increase in viewing probability with patients having 1.71 times higher odds of viewing their reports (OR = 1.71, 95 % CI: 1.27–2.32, p < 0.001). This increase in patient viewership held for all modalities tested except CT (P < 0.01). Despite increased viewership, the reading grade level of radiologist dictated radiology reports was greater than the recommended level for health information across all years and modalities tested.
Conclusions and relevance
Patients are increasingly engaging with their radiology reports, but reports may be too complex for the typical patient. Solutions will be required to improve patient experience with their radiology reports.}

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the most recent LLMs—Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash—in yielding correct answers to questions related to soil science, a fundamental discipline in agricultural, natural resources, and environmental sciences. For this purpose, 105 specialized multiple-choice questions covering all domains of soil science were selected from the Iranian national PhD entrance exam in soil science. The GPT-4o-based chatbot, also known as ChatGPT, was employed to translate questions from Persian into English to assess the impact of input language on its performance. The LLMs were compared using Cohen's Kappa coefficient and the Chi-Square test. The study results indicated that the overall performance of chatbots powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o was comparable, as both models correctly answered 64.80 % of the questions. Nevertheless, these chatbots had significantly higher answering accuracy than Gemini 1.5 Pro and cost-efficient LLMs, namely Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini (p < 0.05). This finding suggests that soil science questions could be categorized as complex tasks for chatbots. The GPT-4o model's performance in answering questions was not significantly dependent on the language used (p > 0.05), revealing that input language is not a limiting factor when applying ChatGPT to soil science. Overall, AI chatbots can, at best, achieve slightly above-moderate performance in answering soil science questions. The study highlights the importance of soil scientists' knowledge and experience in integrating AI chatbots into soil science research and education.}

It is important to design and optimize the geometry of architected materials within a wide search space. This study integrates Voronoi tessellation and informatics to construct architected materials informatics for geometry optimization. Voronoi tessellation can design diverse architected materials by dividing a design space with bisecting planes between arbitrarily arranged seed points and replacing the bisecting plane edges with solid struts. The neural network surrogate model predicts the properties of the architected materials based on the seed point coordinates and the strut radius. The genetic algorithm inversely analyzes the surrogate model to optimize the seed point coordinates and strut radius directly linked to the optimized architected material geometry. This framework rapidly optimized the geometry of cellular-structured heat sinks, optimally balancing pressure loss and heat transfer (Pareto front) under forced convection. The optimized geometry of the Pareto front was validated using computational fluid dynamics and experiments. In addition, the data obtained during the optimization was analyzed to develop a strategy to improve the pressure loss and heat transfer trade-off. This study provides architected materials informatics framework to optimize the geometry of architected materials for diverse applications.}

abstract = {Background
Pyloromyotomy is a clean surgical procedure with a low risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). Despite this, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) is often administered, raising concerns about unnecessary antibiotic exposure and antimicrobial resistance. This study aims to evaluate whether SAP reduces SSI rates in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and to propose a guideline for selective SAP omission.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Infants undergoing pyloromyotomy between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2023 were included. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SSIs within 30 days postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included stratified rates of superficial, deep incisional, and organ/space SSIs.
Results
Among 4917 infants (age <1 year; 84.26 % male), 49.48 % received SAP. Additionally, 81 patients (1.65 %) received post-operative antibiotics beyond the intraoperative period. The overall SSI rate was 1.42 %, primarily comprised of superficial SSIs. There was no significant difference in SSI rates between infants receiving SAP (1.15 %) and those not receiving SAP (1.69 %) (p = 0.110). The rate of unplanned readmission and unplanned return to the operating room within 30 days was 2.44 % and 1.04 %, respectively, with no significant difference between those who received post-operative antibiotics and those who did not (p > 0.2 for both comparisons).
Conclusions
Routine SAP administration in pyloromyotomy is unnecessary given the low risk of SSIs. SAP in ASA Class I or II infants undergoing isolated pyloromyotomy without mucosal perforation, immune-compromising conditions, infections, or trauma should be omitted. These findings support efforts to optimize antibiotic stewardship in pediatric surgical practice.

Expressing these novel, structurally unprecedented proteins within cellular systems inherently adds complexity to their functional unpredictability. Robust biosafety and bioethics evaluations are therefore required to address potential risks such as immune reactions, cellular pathway disruptions, and environmental persistence. We systematically analyse the computational frameworks underpinning this revolution and highlight the capability of de novo proteins to act as a modular toolkit for synthetic biology. Looking forward, we envision integrating closed-loop validation with multi-omics profiling for comprehensive risk assessments along with a hierarchical design framework for advancing the future of synthetic biology – from the creation of tailored de novo functional protein modules and structure-guided rational genetic circuits design to the development of full-synthetic cellular systems, thereby establishing a scalable path from protein design to system-level implementation.}

We retrospectively investigated clinical, radiological, and pathological features of B3 lesions associated with the risk of subsequent upgrade to malignancy. Methods: We included consecutive vacuum-assisted biopsies (VABs) performed during 2011–2020 on suspicious microcalcifications not associated with other radiological signs diagnosed as B3 lesions and followed by surgical excision (SE) with definitive histological examination. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to identify independent predictors of malignancy. Results: Out of the 366 B3 lesions included, 56 (15.3 %, 95 % CI 11.8–19.4 %) had upgraded to malignancy at SE: of these, 42/366 (11.5 %, 95 % CI 8.4–15.2 %) and 14/366 (3.8 %, 95 % CI 2.1–6.3 %) were in situ and invasive carcinoma, respectively. At univariate analysis, variables positively associated with upgrade to malignancy were age ≥ 60 years (p = 0.008), mixed morphology (p = 0.018), scattered distribution (p = 0,001), extension of microcalcifications > 10 mm (p = 0.001), and mixed B3 lesion (p = 0.017). Among B3 subtypes, the highest rates of upgrade were observed for AIDEP, LCIS/LIN2, FEA + AIDEP, FEA + LCIS/LIN2, and FEA + AIDEP + LCIS/LIN2 (24.6 %, 21.4 %, 25.3 %, 20.0 % and 40.0 % respectively), while FEA and ALH/LIN1 had a lower rates of upgrade (7.5 % and 3.7 %, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed as risk factors older age (p = 0.029), larger extension (p = 0.001) and mixed morphology (p = 0.007) of microcalcifications, AIDEP (p = 0.011) among pure B3 lesions, and FEA + AIDEP (p = 0.001) and FEA + AIDEP + LCIS/LIN2 (p = 0.037) among mixed B3 lesions. Conclusions: Based on our findings, vacuum-assisted excision is reasonable as definitive management for FEA and ALH/LIN1, while SE should remain the mainstay of treatment for AIDEP and LCIS/LIN2, whose upgrade rates are too high to safely recommend VAE.}

abstract = {Background
Augmentation cystoplasty (AC) is a surgical procedure used to manage pediatric neurogenic bladder (NB) when conservative treatments fail. While AC improves bladder function and continence, it carries significant long-term risks. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the functional benefits and complications of AC in pediatric NB patients.
Methods
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception until February 14, 2025. Eligible studies included pediatric patients (≤18 years) with NB who underwent AC. Primary outcomes were continence improvement and bladder capacity increase, while secondary outcomes included complications such as bladder stones, perforation, and reoperation rates. A one-group meta-analysis was performed using logit transformation for categorical outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics.
Results
Nine retrospective cohort studies comprising 696 pediatric patients were included. The pooled continence improvement rate was 78.1 % (95 % CI: 62–89 %), and bladder capacity increased by 82.1 % (95 % CI: 64.3–99.9 %). The incidence of bladder stones was 19.3 %, bladder perforation was 6.0 %, and reoperation occurred in 24 % of cases. Significant heterogeneity was observed for reoperation rates (I2 = 97 %).
Conclusion
AC effectively improves continence and bladder capacity in pediatric NB patients, but it carries a substantial risk of complications. The high reoperation and complication rates underscore the need for careful patient selection, standardized surgical techniques, and structured follow-up.}

abstract = {As we move beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of future infodemics remains significant, driven by emerging health crises and the increasing influence of artificial intelligence in the information ecosystem. During periods of apparent stability, proactive efforts to advance infodemiology are essential for enhancing preparedness and improving public health outcomes. This requires a thorough examination of the foundations of this evolving discipline, particularly in understanding how to accurately identify an infodemic at the appropriate time and scale, and how to distinguish it from other processes of viral information spread, both within and outside the realm of public health. In this paper, we integrate expertise from data science and public health to examine the key differences between information production during an infodemic and viral information spread. We explore both clear and subtle distinctions, including context and contingency (ie, the association of an infodemic and viral information spread with a health crisis); information dynamics in terms of volume, spread, and predictability; the role of misinformation and information voids; societal impact; and mitigation strategies. By analyzing these differences, we highlight challenges and open questions. These include whether an infodemic is solely associated with pandemics or whether it could arise from other health emergencies; if infodemics are limited to health-related issues or if they could emerge from crises initially unrelated to health (like climate events); and whether infodemics are exclusively global phenomena or if they can occur on national or local scales. Finally, we propose directions for future quantitative research to help the scientific community more robustly differentiate between these phenomena and develop tailored management strategies.}

However, with the explosive growth of demand for data and annotation in generative models and the emphasis on data-centric algorithms, improving model performance by improving data-efficiency has become another way for the future development of generative models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to improve the performance of the generative models inspired by active learning. Through the cognitive feature extractor of generative models (similar oracle in active learning) to complete the annotation of data informativeness. By guiding the generative models to focus on samples in low-feature density region, i.e., with high informativeness, the models can gradually achieve “full-cognition” of the data. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our strategy and demonstrate its widespread application in generative models and downstream data-driven tasks.}

Credit is commonly being taken for authorship by those who fail to meet authorial criteria, which is unethical. Experienced coauthors are providing inadequate diligence in drafting, critical review, and final approval of submitted articles, which is unethical or, at the very least, careless. Research lacking originality (“copycat” studies) is becoming common, which although not unethical, is uninteresting and creates a burden for journal reviewers, editors, and, most of all, readers. Publication of least publishable units (LPU or “salami slicing”), where authors divide a single research publication into a number of papers with small amounts of information in each paper, results in quantity rather than quality and is ethically inappropriate. LPU can result in redundancy, self-plagiarism, publication overlap, and duplicate reporting of patient data that can result in inaccurate conclusions in systematic reviews. Duplicate submission of a paper to more than one journal (in the same or different languages), such that the paper is under peer review by multiple journals at the same time is unethical and can result in two or more journals publishing the same article. Duplicate publication (publication of a paper that overlaps substantially with one already published), without clear reference to the previous publication is unethical. Predatory journals, with low standards of quality or peer review, and predatory practices by publishers and owners of ostensibly nonpredatory journals, can result in solicitation and acceptance of articles (as well as author publication charges or fees) for the purpose of generating revenue, rather than for legitimate editorial reasons based on article quality and content. This is unethical. Opportunities exist to mitigate against these trends, and by naming these trends and identifying opportunities to avoid ethical transgression, our well-intentioned community can publish our scholarship in an unimpeachable manner.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic meningococcal disease is a rare and under-recognized manifestation of Neisseria meningitidis infection. Unlike acute meningococcal infections, its presentation is insidious, leading to diagnostic delays. We conducted a systematic review to better characterize its clinical, microbiological, and epidemiological profile.
Methods
A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024608035). We searched Excerpta Medica, National Library of Medicine, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and bibliographies for cases reported since 1960 using the terms “chronic meningococcemia” or “chronic meningococcal disease.” Eligible cases involved previously apparently healthy individuals with N. meningitidis isolated from a normally sterile site. Two reviewers independently extracted data on demographics, clinical features, diagnostics, microbiology, treatment, and outcomes.
Results
A total of 126 cases from 97 reports were included. Most patients (median age: 21 years) presented with recurrent fever (98 %), non-blanching skin lesions (95 %), and musculoskeletal symptoms (90 %) over a period of ≥ 10 days. In over two-thirds of cases, symptoms followed a relapsing-remitting pattern, with alternating episodes of fever, rash, and joint involvement. Diagnosis was delayed longer in adults than in children (P < 0.0001). Blood cultures were positive in 77 % of cases; molecular testing and skin biopsy improved diagnostic yield. N. meningitidis serogroup B (58 %) and C (31 %) were most common. Meningeal signs were largely absent (94 %). Antimicrobial therapy led to complete recovery without sequelae in all patients. Testing for inherited susceptibility was conducted in 52 cases and revealed abnormalities - primarily complement deficiencies - in 13 (23 %) of them.
Conclusions
Chronic meningococcal disease should be considered in individuals with relapsing fever, vasculitic skin lesions, and joint involvement, especially when cultures are negative or symptoms mimic viral or autoimmune conditions. Early use of molecular diagnostics and awareness of characteristic patterns may improve recognition. The term "relapsing-remitting meningococcal disease" may better reflect its clinical nature.}

We then conducted a mixed-method evaluation with 35 fifth and sixth-grade students who played Robot’s Dream and answered a post-test questionnaire on usability, user experience, and impact. The user study results demonstrated adequate usability and user experience with emotional engagement of the participants. However, the participants gave mixed reactions to realism and discomfort with the IVR hardware. The results also showed high perceived potential for empathy training and raising awareness of empathy. By retrospectively analyzing the development process and the user study results, we presented learned lessons and identified aspects in Robot’s Dream for future improvement. The presented development account of Robot’s Dream and the user study results can be helpful for educators, researchers, and developers interested in personalizing empathy training and other psychological training with IVR games.}

abstract = {Background
The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT; Google) and GPT (OpenAI), has introduced significant advancements in natural language processing. These models are increasingly integrated into various applications, including mental health support. However, the credibility of LLMs in providing reliable and explainable mental health information and support remains underexplored.
Objective
This scoping review systematically maps the factors influencing the credibility of LLMs in mental health support, including reliability, explainability, and ethical considerations. The review is expected to offer critical insights for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers, guiding future research and policy development. These findings will contribute to the responsible integration of LLMs into mental health care, with a focus on maintaining ethical standards and user trust.
Methods
This review follows PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. Eligibility criteria include studies that apply transformer-based generative language models in mental health support, such as BERT and GPT. Sources include PsycINFO, MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library. A systematic search of studies from 2019 onward will be conducted and updated until October 2024. Data will be synthesized qualitatively. The Population, Concept, and Context framework will guide the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers will screen and extract data, resolving discrepancies through discussion. Data will be synthesized and presented descriptively.
Results
As of September 2024, this study is currently in progress, with the systematic search completed and the screening phase ongoing. We expect to complete data extraction by early November 2024 and synthesis by late November 2024.
Conclusions
This scoping review will map the current evidence on the credibility of LLMs in mental health support. It will identify factors influencing the reliability, explainability, and ethical considerations of these models, providing insights for practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and users. These findings will fill a critical gap in the literature and inform future research, practice, and policy development, ensuring the responsible integration of LLMs in mental health services.

The presence of high signal intensity on T2 imaging and late gadolinium enhancement, in conjunction with intense metabolic activity at the mass site on positron emission tomography (PET), raised the possibility of an inflammatory or malignant mass. The diagnosis of IPT was confirmed by biopsy. Our case highlights the utility of PET imaging to confirm the inflammatory nature and extent of an IPT.}

Algorithmic tools are increasing users’ production capacity for literary and artistic works to almost infinite levels. However, the quality of the outputs is strictly dependent on the quantity and quality of the inputs, some of which are protected by copyright. This scenario gave raise to tensions between copyright holders and generative AI companies. While the formers claim control over this new kind of exploitation of their works, the latters wish to train their algorithms freely with as many contents as possible. This contribution suggests exploring the idea of introducing a statutory license for machine learning purposes as a compromise solution to ensure an attractive environment for artificial intelligence without marginalizing the role played by human authors. This remuneration proposal is rooted in a fundamental rights analysis that balances i.e., the right to science and culture and freedom of artistic expression (Arts. 11 and 13 EUCF, 19 UDHR, 27.1 UDHR, 15.1 a and b ICESCR) vis-à-vis the right for creators to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from their scientific, literary or artistic production (Arts. 17.2 EUCF, 27.2 UDHR, and 15.1 c ICESCR).}

To contribute to this understanding, the objective of this work was to assess students’ perceptions of the widely diffused chatbot ChatGPT and its use as a learning tool. A mixed methodology was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses in a repeated cross-sectional study with an intervention. Data was collected from undergraduate students in Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering across three different semesters. The qualitative evaluation indicated that the course level had no impact on students’ perceptions, and gender only influenced prior knowledge of ChatGPT, without affecting satisfaction or perceived usability. The strongest correlation was found between the perceived quality of the responses and overall satisfaction. Response quality was also a central theme in the qualitative data, with about 45 % of respondents noting that ChatGPT should be used cautiously due to its lack of accuracy in more complex tasks. The study also evaluated ChatGPT's specific applicability as a learning tool in courses focused on machining. In this context, students viewed its use positively when applied as a complementary aid. Ultimately, the results suggest that, regardless of students' prior familiarity with ChatGPT, most were able to use it effectively, demonstrated critical thinking regarding its use, and expressed willingness to adopt it as a complementary learning tool.}

abstract = {Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD) is a rare but often fatal complication of allogeneic transfusion, caused by the activation and expansion of donor T lymphocytes in susceptible recipients. Prevention focuses on reducing these immune cells through leukoreduction and irradiation. While leukoreduction of blood components decreases white blood cell content and improves overall transfusion safety, it does not fully prevent TA-GVHD, as viable T cells may persist. Irradiation using gamma or X-ray methods remain the most effective strategy, inactivating donor T cells by inducing DNA damage and suppressing proliferation. However, it also compromises red blood cell quality by increasing hemolysis, oxidative injury, membrane damage, extracellular potassium, and reducing storage duration. As an alternative, hypothermic storage of leukoreduced red blood cells is gaining attention. Evidence suggests that extending storage beyond 21 days significantly reduces T cell viability and proliferation without compromising red blood cell integrity. Further research is needed to directly compare the efficacy of hypothermic storage to irradiation.}

abstract = {Purpose
LibQUAL is an international recognized tool for evaluating user satisfaction across three dimensions: Affect of Service, Information Control and Library as Place. With the rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in library systems, spanning both the Global South and North, there is a growing need to adapt LibQUAL to reflect these technological advancements. This study aims to advocate for a revision of LibQUAL to include a dedicated AI dimension that aligns with evolving service models.
Design/methodology/approach
This conceptual study draws on a comprehensive review of recent practices that highlights the increasing integration of AI technologies across diverse library contexts. This paper investigates how AI tools such as chatbots, recommendation systems and automated cataloguing are reshaping traditional library functions and user experiences.
Findings
This study proposes that LibQUAL should evolve to include a fourth dimension focused on AI services. This future-ready addition would enable libraries to assess the quality of AI-driven offerings, gather targeted feedback from users, identify service gaps and implement iterative improvements. Despite widespread AI adoption, no existing opinion piece or framework has thoroughly addressed the need for updating LibQUAL to reflect this AI shift.
Originality/value
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is among the first to systematically argue for the integration of AI as a core evaluative category in LibQUAL. It contributes to both library assessment literature and strategic planning by offering a forward-looking approach to measuring service quality in an increasingly AI-reliant library environment.}

Grief is a complex and multifaceted process. While there is no reason to think that the grieving process would be dissimilar if an LGBTQ+ individual loses a partner than the grief of a heterosexual individual, they often receive and perceive less practical and emotional support, empathy and are treated unequally legally post loss. To date no studies have investigated whether this experience (disenfranchised loss) more likely leads to prolonged grief disorder or other mental health sequelae. This article describes aspects of disenfranchised grief, loneliness, and artificial intelligence for emotional support based on the personal experience of an older gay widower who was moderately depressed and lonely at the time of enrollment in a clinical trial for late-life bereavement and suicide risk.}

Starting from this proposal, the hypothesis extends further to the possible influence of PCSK9 CHRD SNVs on the development, therapeutic effects, and prognosis of cancer based on recently discovered roles of CD36 in tumour biology.

The structural equation modeling is a path analysis method based on the factor analysis and linear regression, which can be used to analyze the path relationship between intricate variables. Based on the structural equation modeling, this paper analyzes the potential pathways for artificial intelligence chatbots to induce the user's emotional dependence. The results show that the “sense of identification” and “sense of control” will cause people to have emotional dependence on the artificial intelligence chatbots, with p < 0.05. However, the psychological distance plays a regulating role in the identification-emotional dependence and the sense of control-emotional dependence, respectively.

Knowledge of the traits that influence tick resistance contributes to the development of breeding strategies designed to improve herd productivity. Within this context, this study evaluated the resistance of Caracu, a tropically adapted cattle breed, to R. microplus. Tick count, hair length, coat thickness, and coat color were evaluated in 202 naturally tick-infested females (cows and heifers) over a period of 18 months. Blood samples were collected from all animals during the winter season for hematological analysis. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlations, generalized linear models, and principal component analysis. Correlation coefficients of tick count with coat color, coat thickness, and hair length were estimated within each season. Hematological parameters were only included in the winter season analysis and were analyzed by the restricted maximum likelihood method using log-transformed data. No differences in blood parameters were observed between animals with and without ticks. However, tick count was negatively correlated with erythrocytes (−0.29) and hematocrit (−0.24) and positively correlated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin (0.21) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (0.25). These findings suggest that higher tick counts lead to a decrease in erythrocytes but also to an increase in the amount of hemoglobin per erythrocyte, which could reduce the damage caused by low erythrocyte levels due to tick hematophagy, delaying or preventing anemia. Although tick infestation on pasture was demonstrated by the infestation of all staff members during herd management, none of the animals exhibited high tick counts, providing evidence of resistance of Caracu animals to R. microplus. Tick infestation was influenced by age class (cows > heifers), season (spring and summer > fall and winter), coat thickness (>1.5 mm > <1.5 mm), and hair length (>6 mm > <6 mm). Three components were extracted by principal component analysis, which accounted for 69.46% of data variance. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of efficient strategies aimed at reducing economic losses due to tick infestation and could be applied in animal breeding to select for tick resistance traits, reducing chemical control strategies and consequently improving sustainable livestock production.}

abstract = {Introduction
Distal femur fractures are commonly managed with retrograde femoral nailing or locked lateral plating (LLP). As implant design has evolved, more distal and complex patterns are being treated with intramedullary implants. The aim of the present study was to compare early outcomes in distal femur fractures managed with the novel DePuy Synthes RFN-Advanced (RFNA) Retrograde Femoral Nailing System to a similar cohort treated with locked lateral plating.
Patients and methods
This is a retrospective cohort study of operative distal femur fractures that presented to our Level I trauma center over a 7-year period. We included patients with AO/OTA types 33A2–3, 33C1–2 fractures treated with either the RFNA or a lateral locked plate over two distinct time points. Injury radiographs were reviewed independently by three orthopedic traumatologists to include only cases deemed “nailable.” Primary outcomes included coronal and sagittal alignment. Secondary outcomes included nonunion, surgical site infection (SSI), and unplanned reoperation.
Results
We identified 107 patients treated with either the RFNA (n = 45) or LLP (n = 62) over the 7-year study period. No significant differences were identified in the rates of sagittal (2.2 % versus 9.7 %, P = 0.12) or coronal malalignment (2.2 % versus 0 %, P = 0.421). The nonunion rate was 8.9 % in the RFNA cohort versus 19.4 % in the LLP cohort, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.174). We also found no difference in infection or implant failure between groups. Screw backout occurred in 8 RFNA patients (17.8 %), with 7 patients undergoing screw removal (15.6 %) either in clinic (n = 5) or the operating room (n = 2).
Discussion and conclusions
This matched cohort study demonstrated promising results comparing the RFNA to lateral plating of distal femur fractures. The nonunion rate of 9 % in the RFNA cohort adds to recent literature that supports improved union rates with intramedullary nailing of these fractures. Interlocking screw backout was the most common complication with RFNA treatment at a rate of 16 %, with the majority removed in clinic.

abstract = {Aim
To evaluate student experiences with the Independent Authentic Clinical Reasoning Task (I-ACRT), an assessment designed to elicit unaided clinical judgment in nursing students by restricting generative AI use.
Background
AI tools are rapidly transforming nursing education. While they enhance access and efficiency, overreliance can impair independent reasoning. The I-ACRT was developed to preserve foundational clinical judgment by replicating authentic practice conditions while removing AI and peer input.
Methods
Student reflections were drawn from open-ended responses on end-of-course evaluations in a junior-level BSN course. Evaluations were anonymous and collected through a third-party platform. Comments explicitly referencing I-ACRTs were coded and analyzed thematically using NVivo. A total of 11 student responses met inclusion criteria. This study was an exploratory program evaluation using qulitative descriptive methodology and inductive content analysis.
Results
Four major themes emerged: (1) Cognitive adjustment, including initial frustration and increased fluency across attempts; (2) Desire for coaching, especially in preparation and feedback; (3) Desire for greater clarity in task expectations; and (4) Perceived benefit, with students noting gains in conceptual understanding and preparedness for clinical reasoning. Students described the I-ACRT as cognitively demanding but ultimately valuable when paired with structured support.
Conclusions
The I-ACRT is a feasible and effective model for assessing foundational clinical reasoning in an AI-restricted environment. While initial cognitive load was high, students improved over time and valued the realism and independence the task required. Findings support further refinement of the I-ACRT model as a tool for preparing students to critically engage with AI in clinical practice.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a revolutionary force in the constantly evolving technology landscape, transforming many industries, including libraries. Libraries have been focusing on experimenting with emerging AI technologies to innovate their services, especially for supporting entrepreneurs. Generative AI, for instance, ChatGPT, holds immense potential for libraries by enabling them to provide advanced support to entrepreneurs, for instance, meeting the business needs of the entrepreneurs, or strengthening entrepreneurial education programs. By concentrating on the adoption of generative AI, librarians will be encouraged to experiment and use their expertise in current generative AI technologies to test out future ones and adopt the more useful ones.
Method and analysis
The objective of the research is to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of ChatGPT technology by librarians in their provision of support for entrepreneurs. The research aims to provide insights that can help formulate the strategies for the successful adoption of ChatGPT technology in library settings to enhance their support for entrepreneurs. To achieve the research objective, the research study adopts a correlational research design that will empirically test the hypothesis- the relationship between latent variables affecting the three stages of technology adoption. Surveys will be administered to librarians actively engaged in assisting entrepreneurs, aiming to capture data on various factors influencing their adoption decisions, and hence aiding in empirical validation of the formulated hypothesis. Before commencing data collection, participants will be provided with a detailed informed consent sheet outlining the research's purpose, procedures involved, the voluntary nature of the participation, and potential risks involved. Only after participants have explicitly provided their consent are they granted access to the survey questionnaire. This ensures transparency and ethical compliance throughout the research process. To safeguard participant confidentiality and maintain data integrity, all research data will be securely stored in password-protected cloud storage platforms, such as University OneDrive. Strict data handling protocols will be followed, with access limited to authorized research team members. Moreover, participants' personal information will not be collected, ensuring anonymity and privacy. Stringent quality assurance measures will be implemented to ensure the reliability and validity of the research findings. Before survey administration, a pilot test will be conducted to refine the survey instrument and identify any ambiguities. The pilot testing will adhere to ethical guidelines and principles, including the mandatory nature of informed consent, as well as protocols for data storage, handling procedures, and safety considerations outlined for the main research study. Continuous monitoring and peer review processes will be employed to mitigate individual biases and errors, thereby enhancing the overall robustness of the research outcomes. Data cleaning procedures, including outlier detection and imputation techniques, will further reinforce the integrity and completeness of the dataset. Additionally, member checking with participants will ensure the accuracy and alignment of research interpretations with participants' perspectives, bolstering the credibility of the study findings. Through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the collected data will undergo rigorous analysis using the SmartPLS 4 software version, validating the complex relationships between different constructs of the theoretical model.
Discussion
The research will have both theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, it seeks to identify factors influencing ChatGPT adoption among librarians supporting entrepreneurs, enriching our understanding of technology adoption dynamics in library services. Practically, the findings offer actionable insights for librarians, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders supporting innovation. By uncovering adoption drivers and barriers, librarians can develop dynamic capabilities to experiment with emerging AI technologies, foster co-creation with patrons, and thereby strengthen entrepreneur support services. The results will also have greater implications for the countries where libraries are yet to be positioned as innovation actor supporting entrepreneurship.}

We utilized data with tens of thousands of alloy materials from the Materials Project (MP) and Automatic FLOW for Materials Discovery (AFLOW) databases. Without any experimental voltage input, we identified over 30 alloy systems that have been experimentally validated with good precision. Additionally, we predicted over 100 alloy anodes with low potential and high specific capacity. We hope this work to spur further interest in employing advanced machine learning models for the design of battery materials.}

Moreover, due to differences in knowledge complexity and the availability of data resources, when performing multi-discipline tasks, users devote more effort to query optimization and data evaluation but gain lower search performance.

Methods
Participants listened to a selection of classical music daily for 30 days. Cortisol levels and DNA damage (measured by micronucleus frequency and nuclear buds) were assessed before and after the intervention.
Results
After one month, the pilot study did not find a significant reduction in cortisol levels. However, music listening therapy was associated with a reduction in DNA damage, as evidenced by a decrease in micronucleus frequency.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that music listening therapy could be a promising non-pharmacological intervention for children and adolescents with ASD.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
Deep learning technologies have demonstrated the ability to identify dyssynergic defecation for diagnosis of common gastrointestinal motility disorders through nuanced interpretation of 3-dimensional high-definition anal manometry (3D-HDAM). We aimed to validate a deep learning algorithm capable of spatiotemporal analysis of 3D-HDAM in a multicenter setting.
Methods
We included 1214 consecutive anorectal manometry studies performed across 3 large health care systems between 2018 and 2022. Deep learning results were compared with expert interpretation according to the London consensus protocol as reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using bootstrap sampling to calculate area under the curve (AUC). We used Wilcoxon tests to analyze how well the confidence scores from the deep learning model correlated with the likelihood that experts would assign ambiguous labels in cases where determinations were uncertain. Video-based deep learning features were clustered using Gaussian Mixture Modeling to reveal novel dyssynergia subtypes.
Results
The deep hybrid learning algorithm achieved AUCs of 0.99 (± 0.001 standard deviation), 0.90 ± 0.008, and 0.79 ± 0.003 at Dartmouth Health, Henry Ford Hospital, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, respectively, performance comparable or superior to solely deep learning or traditional modeling on every cohort. The algorithm appeared capable of reporting confidence aligned with manual expert interpretation of ambiguity (W = −20.50; P < .001; −1.73; P = .08; and −3.22; P = .001). We further identified 2 novel classes of dyssynergia patterns that may represent clinically relevant phenotypes of dyssynergia.
Conclusions
3D-HDAM combined with video-based deep learning is a useful and clinically relevant technology for evaluating anorectal dyssynergia. Future use cases can be expanded to evaluate other motility disorders and their treatment.}

abstract = {Cell biology emerges from spatiotemporally coordinated molecular processes. Recent advances in live-cell microscopy, fueled by a surge in optical, molecular, and computational technologies, have enabled dynamic observations from single molecules to whole organisms. Despite technological leaps, there is still an untapped opportunity to fully leverage their capabilities toward biological insight. We highlight how single-molecule imaging has transformed our understanding of biological processes, with a focus on chromatin organization and transcription in the nucleus. We describe how this was enabled by the close integration of new imaging techniques with analysis tools and discuss the challenges to make a comparable impact at larger scales from organelles to organisms. By highlighting recent successful examples, we describe an outlook of ever-increasing data and the need for seamless integration between dataset visualization and quantification to realize the full potential warranted by advances in new imaging technologies.}

abstract = {Post-mortem iris recognition (PMIR) is a recently developed area of expertise falling into the broader category of biometric methods utilizing human iris features for the purpose of automatic or semi-automatic establishing or confirming one’s identity. Yet, contrary to traditional iris recognition applied to living individuals, post-mortem biometrics presents forensic experts and scientists with challenges that have previously been unknown and require novel approaches and development of new skills. This paper summarizes the current state of the art of research in this area, both with respect to studies exploring the feasibility of iris recognition in a forensic setting, as well as the challenges still pervasive in the scientific community and potential ways to overcome them. We argue that post-mortem iris biometrics can serve both as a way for improving iris recognition, as well as provide forensic examiners tools for extending knowledge and skills in their respective field.}

abstract = {Background
In addition to standard older adult care services, mobile medical devices have proved to be an effective tool for controlling the health of older adults. However, little is known about the variables driving the acceptance of these gadgets and the willingness of older adults in China to use them.
Objective
This study aims to explore the factors that affect the use of mobile health (mHealth) devices by older adults in China, focusing on individual, social, and family influences.
Methods
The Psychology and Behavior Investigation of Chinese Residents survey database provided the data for this study. The survey was conducted in 148 Chinese cities between June 20 and August 31, 2022. The parameters linked to older persons’ desire to use mobile medical devices were determined by this study using a combination model of multiple stepwise linear regression and a classification and regression tree decision tree.
Results
In total, 4085 older adults took part in the poll. On a scale of 0 to 100, the average score for willingness to adopt mHealth devices was 63.70 (SD 25.11). The results of the multiple stepwise linear regression showed that having a postgraduate degree and higher (β=.040; P=.007), being unemployed (β=.037; P=.02), having a high social status (β=.085; P<.001), possessing high health literacy (β=.089; P<.001), demonstrating high self-efficacy (β=.043; P=.02), not living with children (β=.0340; P=.02), having a household per capita monthly income of >Y4000 (US $550) (β=.048; P=.002), experiencing high perceived social support (β=.096; P<.001), reporting a high quality of life (β=.149; P<.001), having higher levels of family communication (β=–.071; P<.001), having an identity bubble (β=.085; P<.001), not having chronic diseases (β=.049; P=.001), and experiencing mild depression (β=–.035; P=.02) were associated with older adults’ willingness to use mHealth devices. The classification and regression tree decision tree model’s findings demonstrated that the primary determinants of older adults’ desire to use mHealth devices are quality of life, identity bubble, social status, health literacy, family health, and perceived social support.
Conclusions
This study uses the Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model to investigate the effects of demand variables, enabling resources, and predisposing traits on older persons’ propensity to use mHealth devices. These results offer reference data for the marketing and use of mHealth devices for older individuals in the future. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to create a balanced and harmonious integration of technology and humanistic care.}

abstract = {Introduction
Refractory prosthetic joint infections (PJI) of the hip remain a major challenge in orthopedic surgery. The Girdlestone procedure, also known as resection arthroplasty, was originally described for native hips but has since been adopted as a salvage option for complex and recurrent prosthetic infections. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure in treating prosthetic hip infections in this context.
Materials and methods
Eighty-eight patients (91 hips) who underwent femoral resection arthroplasty for refractory hip prosthesis infection between March 2004 and August 2019 were retrospectively included and analyzed as part of a single-center study with a minimum follow-up of two years. The primary outcome was infection eradication. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of treatment failure and the nature of postoperative complications. Risk factors for failure were identified using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bacteriological data and functional outcomes were also reported.
Results
Out of 91 hips, infection eradication was achieved in 65 cases (71%) following Girdlestone procedure. Six postoperative deaths related to infection occurred (6/88, 7%). In 20 out of 91 hips (22%), one or more revision surgeries were performed for persistent infection after implant removal. Among these, infection control was achieved in 10/20 (50%). Multivariate analysis identified corticosteroid use (HR = 6; p < 0.01), preoperative fever (HR = 4.12; p < 0.01), and polymicrobial infection (HR = 2.5; p < 0.05) as independent risk factors for failure. The mean limb shortening was 5.7 (±1.7) cm, and the average walking distance was 175 (±350) meters. The mean Merle d’Aubigné and Postel score at final follow-up was 9.3 (±2.2) out of 18.
Conclusion
Definitive removal of the hip prosthesis remains a viable therapeutic option in refractory infections, despite a substantial complication rate. It should be considered, particularly when the prosthesis is no longer functional.
