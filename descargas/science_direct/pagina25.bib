abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Both abdominal obesity (AO) and insulin resistance (IR) are predictors of cardiometabolic disease (CMD). We aimed to evaluate the temporal relationship between AO and IR and their combined effect on CMD risk.
Methods
A nationally representative cohort of 9234 participants was included, with a maximum follow-up of 9 years. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index was calculated as an indicator of IR, and AO was measured by waist circumference (WC). Cox regression was applied to evaluate the combined effect of AO and TyG on CMD risk, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. A cross-lagged panel model was used to examine the temporal relationship. Multiplicative and additive interactions between AO and insulin resistance, as well as the mediating effect of TyG, were assessed.
Results
Individuals concurrently with AO and higher TyG (≥8.6 [median]) had the highest risk of hypertension (HR,1.46; 95%CI, 1.25-1.69), diabetes (HR, 1.99; 95%CI, 1.65-2.41), and stroke (HR, 1.76; 95%CI, 1.22-1.94). A biological interaction between AO and IR on diabetes was observed, with the attributable proportion due to interaction being 29%. There was a bidirectional temporal relationship between WC and TyG, and the effect of WC on TyG was more prominent than vice versa. High TyG had a mediating effect on the association of AO with hypertension (19%), diabetes (25%), and stroke (24%).
Conclusions
The findings reveal a temporal relationship between AO and IR, their combined effect on hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, and the mediating role of IR. Strategies simultaneously targeting both factors should be emphasized for the primary prevention of CMD.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Tanto la obesidad abdominal (OA) como la resistencia a la insulina (RI) son predictores de enfermedades cardiometabólicas (ECM). Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar la relación temporal entre la OA y la RI, y su efecto combinado en el riesgo de ECM.
Métodos
Se incluyó una cohorte representativa a nivel nacional de 9.234 participantes, con un seguimiento máximo de 9 años. El índice triglicéridos-glucosa (TyG) se calculó como un indicador de RI, y la OA se midió mediante la circunferencia de la cintura (CC). Se aplicó la regresión de Cox para evaluar el efecto combinado de la OA y el TyG en el riesgo de ECM, incluyendo hipertensión, diabetes, enfermedades cardiacas y accidente cerebrovascular. Se utilizó un modelo de correlaciones cruzadas para examinar la relación temporal. Se evaluó la interacción multiplicativa y aditiva entre la OA y la RI, y el efecto mediador del TyG.
Resultados
Los individuos con OA y un TyG elevado (≥8,6 [mediana]) presentaron el mayor riesgo de hipertensión (HR=1,46; IC95%, 1,25-1,69), diabetes (HR=1,99; IC95%, 1,65-2,41) y accidente cerebrovascular (HR=1,76; IC95%, 1,22-1,94). Se observó una interacción biológica entre la OA y la RI en la diabetes, con una proporción atribuible a la interacción del 29%. Hubo una relación temporal bidireccional entre la CC y el TyG, y el efecto de la CC sobre el TyG fue más prominente que al contrario. Un TyG elevado tuvo un efecto mediador en la asociación de la OA con la hipertensión (19%), la diabetes (25%) y los accidentes cerebrovasculares (24%).
Conclusiones
Los hallazgos revelan una relación temporal entre la OA y la RI, su efecto combinado en la hipertensión, la diabetes y el accidente cerebrovascular, y el papel mediador de la RI. Deberían promoverse estrategias que aborden simultáneamente ambos factores para la prevención primaria de las ECM.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the demand of tighter tolerance components requires more accurate machine tools with volumetric compensation. In mass production, post-machining inspection of the workpiece on a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) provides statistical quality control information on the variability of the manufacturing process. The dynamic face offset (DFO) is proposed to compensate the machine tool errors. The method is utilizing the part quality CMM data to determine the specific compensation parameters that are used in the machine tool controller to minimize the machine tool errors for specific part faces. The DFO does not considers the table offset parameters as when using the global offset compensation method. The table errors are incorporated within the local offsets. This paper presents the development of a DFO compensation method utilizing the measurements of the machined part(s). The DFO for 4-axis and 5-axis machine tools is estimated through a model while utilizing the computed deviations between the measured and nominal dimensions of the part. The measuring results before and after compensation are compared and demonstrate that the errors are reduced and compensated successfully.}

Desirable traits often arise from complex gene networks acting across diverse conditions, making them difficult to predict and optimize manually. In the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has supported this process, but its large data needs and poor integration limit its role to pattern recognition rather than explanatory trait design. We argue that hybrid AI can more effectively navigate multiomics complexity to engineer climate-smart, high-yield crops. Already reducing trial and error in crop engineering, guiding gRNA design, and identifying key regulators, hybrid AI has outperformed traditional data-driven approaches, but its full potential requires clear pipelines, curated datasets, and automation platforms.}

There is a paucity of literature examining how preferences differ amongst various demographic groups. This study aimed to assess how perceptions of the ideal breast differ between respondents stratified by self-identified demographic factors. A cohort of 25 patients from the senior surgeon’s practice presenting for breast surgery was assembled. Pre-operative anteroposterior photographs of these patients were distributed via Qualtrics (Seattle, WA) to a large sample designed to be representative of the demographics of the United States. Survey questions aimed to measure respondents’ impressions of 'breast attractiveness'. Respondents were asked to rate breasts on a Likert scale. Survey responses were analysed for differences in breast aesthetic preferences by sex, gender, sexual orientation, and race. Males rated all breasts higher on the Likert scale for attractiveness than females (2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). Despite this discrepancy, ratings amongst male and female respondents were highly correlated with one another (R = 0.940; p < 0.0001). Considering sexual orientation, individuals attracted to women provided significantly higher attractiveness ratings to all breasts compared to individuals attracted to men only (2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). White or Caucasian individuals ascribed significantly higher breast attractiveness ratings than Asian individuals (2.7 vs 2.2, p < 0.001), but not Black or African American individuals (2.7 vs 2.4, p = 0.23). Despite these racial discrepancies in mean breast attractiveness, ratings amongst the three groups were highly correlated. In a sample representative of the United States, a difference in breast aesthetic appraisal was observed by demographic factors. These findings merit further investigation to understand these trends and observations.}

abstract = {Summary
The Glottal Area Waveform (GAW) is an important component in quantitative clinical voice assessment, providing valuable insights into vocal fold function. In this study, we introduce a novel method employing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic GAWs. Our approach enables the creation of synthetic GAWs that closely replicate real-world data, offering a versatile tool for researchers and clinicians. We elucidate the process of manipulating the VAE latent space using the Glottal Opening Vector (GlOVe). The GlOVe allows precise control over the synthetic closure and opening of the vocal folds. By utilizing the GlOVe, we generate synthetic laryngeal biosignals. These biosignals accurately reflect vocal fold behavior, allowing for the emulation of realistic glottal opening changes. This manipulation extends to the introduction of arbitrary oscillations in the vocal folds, closely resembling real vocal fold oscillations. The range of factor coefficient values enables the generation of diverse biosignals with varying frequencies and amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that this approach yields highly accurate laryngeal biosignals, with the Normalized Mean Absolute Error values for various frequencies ranging from 9.6 ⋅ 10−3 to 1.20 ⋅ 10−2 for different experimented frequencies, alongside a remarkable training effectiveness, reflected in reductions of up to approximately 89.52% in key loss components. This proposed method may have implications for downstream speech synthesis and phonetics research, offering the potential for advanced and natural-sounding speech technologies.}

abstract = {Infrared and visible image fusion is aimed at merging features from both modalities in order to produce a more information-rich fused image. However, the majority of existing methods have overlooked the specific requirements and challenges inherent in fusion tasks under low-light conditions. In such scenes, texture degradation due to poor illumination is common, and furthermore, local overexposure may result in significant information loss. To tackle these challenges, a novel framework named BICFusion is introduced, which addresses these issues through reflectance separation, cross-modal feature compensation, and dual enhancement of texture and contrast. The Retinex theory is employed to design a network that extracts reflectance representing the intrinsic structure and details of the scene from the visible image, thereby providing the fusion result with rich structural information under minimal illumination constraints. The cross-modal feature guidance weighting module (CFGW) is developed to compensate for missing details by leveraging the infrared image when the visible image lacks sufficient texture information due to adverse lighting conditions such as low light or overexposure. Subsequently, the texture enhancement fusion module (TEFM) and the global-local contrast enhancement loss function are proposed to jointly enhance the fusion quality in terms of texture and contrast. Experiments conducted with twelve state-of-the-art methods on three publicly available datasets validate the superior performance of BICFusion in preserving fine details under low-light and overexposed conditions.}

China is confronted with the challenge of increasing childhood obesity. Although interventions for childhood obesity have been developed, their effectiveness and implementation can vary considerably across nations. In this paper, we review and consolidate the evidence on childhood obesity intervention strategies aimed at multiple levels and components across life, in China. School-based interventions, primarily delivered with group-based dietary and physical education, have shown potential efficacy and can be enhanced by integrating food environment reform and family support. However, most interventional studies were done in eastern and urban areas of China, which highlights the need for attention in regions with insufficient health resources where policies and initiatives are less accessible. In addition, the sparse reporting on implementation design and delivery might hinder the scalability of potentially effective strategies. Amid rapid social and economic development over the past few decades, China faces unique challenges on urbanisation, physical inactivity, and nutritional transitions, necessitating an updated policy agenda for primary prevention of childhood obesity. Structural longitudinal evaluations of public initiatives led by the government and organisations along with inclusive and equitable interventions targeting children of different ages, urban–rural regions, and different ethnic and socioeconomic groups are warranted. Tackling childhood obesity in China needs a cohesive approach that integrates social, economic, cultural, and environmental strategies, combining school-based, family-based, and individual-based approaches, and concerted efforts from multiple sectors and entities within China.}

abstract = {Background
In health professions education (HPE), the concept of precision education is being explored, with the intention of tailoring learning experiences to the unique needs of learners. Recommender systems can assist academic decision-making. They can be used to personalize content delivery, suggest appropriate learning pathways, propose schedules, recommend suitable institutes, supervisors, and courses, and provide learner feedback. Given abundant learning resources, selecting the right one can be daunting. Recommender systems may address this challenge by offering tailored suggestions that align with learners’ requirements and abilities.
Objective
This study aims to examine the literature related to the use of recommender systems in HPE.
Methods
This review will be conducted following the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley. A comprehensive search will be conducted across the MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, ERIC, Academic Search Premier, and Web of Science databases, as well as gray literature sources including arXiv and Google Scholar. These searches will focus on the period from January 2000 to February 2025. In addition, backward and forward citation searching will be carried out. Articles will be screened independently by 2 reviewers; discrepancies resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. The selection process will involve an initial screening of titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant articles. If initial screening is inconclusive, full-text review will ensure articles meet inclusion criteria. The main eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review are studies involving health professions students or educators, focusing on the concept, development, or application of recommender systems. Data extraction will be performed using a customized data charting template covering article, study, and recommender system details. The extracted data will be analyzed and displayed in both tabular and graphical formats, supplemented by a narrative interpretation. The findings will be synthesized by mapping the existing literature to identify key concepts, research gaps, and types of evidence, highlighting similarities and differences in how recommender systems are applied in HPE. This reporting will be in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. Data extraction and analysis will be conducted using Covidence.
Results
The current phase of the study involves selecting studies for the scoping review as specified in this protocol. The search, screening, and data extraction will begin in February 2025. The results of the study and the submission of a manuscript for peer review are expected in the winter of 2025.
Conclusions
This study aims to comprehensively map the extent of recommender systems in HPE. By identifying effective practices and existing gaps, it will serve as a valuable resource for health professions educators, enabling them to make informed decisions about integrating these systems into educational applications.

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of FENa (Fractional excretion of sodium), FEK (fractional excretion of potassium) and uSID (urinary strong ion difference) in predicting pAKI in sepsis and septic shock.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
Two intensive care units in Argentina.
Patients
Adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and AKI, and had a urinary biochemistry within 24h of the AKI diagnosis.
Interventions
None.
Main variables of interest
We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of FENa, FEK and uSID through a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis.
Results
80 patients were included. 40 patients presented pAKI. pAKI group had higher APACHE, SOFA score, and mortality rate. In the ROC curve analysis, uSID had no diagnostic utility (AUC=0.52, p=0.69). FENa presented moderate accuracy showing an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60−0.83; p=0.001), while FEK presented low accuracy with an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.57−0.80; p=0.04). The optimal Youden point for identifying pAKI was at a FENa higher than 0.51 % with a specificity of 72.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%. In the case of FEK, a value higher than 21.9 % presented the best relation, with a specificity of 67.5% and a sensitivity of 65.0%.
Conclusions
urine biochemistry interpretation in septic patients must be revised. FENa and FEK are related to the severity of AKI and could be helpful complementary tools for diagnosing pAKI.

abstract = {Introduction
Despite existing guidelines, many patients with asthma do not achieve adequate control of their disease. This is largely due to low adherence to inhaled therapy. Single-inhaler administration may improve this and other aspects of asthma therapy, such as cost-effectiveness. The aim of this study is to gather the opinions of a panel of experts on single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) for the treatment of asthma in adult patients.
Material and methods
A recommendation task force reviewed the available evidence and formulated 45 statements divided into 5 sections: efficacy, cost-effectiveness, therapeutic adherence, safety, and patient satisfaction. A validation task force of 71 experts evaluated these recommendations using the 2-round Delphi technique. Panellists rated their agreement with each statement on a 9-point scale.
Results
Consensus was achieved in 42 of the 45 statements. Panellists broadly agreed that SITT improves lung function, reduces exacerbations, is cost-effective, and promotes therapeutic adherence. The safety of TT was considered favourable, even in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities. The panellists also agreed on the importance of evaluating patient satisfaction with the inhaler. However, no consensus was reached regarding the suitability of TT as a first-line treatment, nor on whether TT is more beneficial than up-dosing ICS in patients with a low inflammatory profile currently receiving dual therapy. Additionally, panellists did not agree on whether sick leave due to respiratory causes was associated with greater adherence to TT.
Conclusions
The consensus indicates that SITT is considered an effective, safe option for the treatment of asthma that improves therapeutic adherence and patient satisfaction. Further real-world studies are needed to evaluate its implementation in different clinical contexts.
Resumen
Introducción
A pesar de las directrices existentes, muchos pacientes con asma no logran un control adecuado de la enfermedad. Esto se debe en gran parte a la baja adhesión a la terapia inhalada. La administración en dispositivo único puede mejorar este y otros aspectos, como coste-efectividad del tratamiento. Este estudio tiene como objetivo desarrollar un consenso de expertos sobre la triple terapia (TT) en un solo inhalador para el tratamiento del asma en pacientes adultos.
Material y métodos
Un grupo elaborador de recomendaciones revisó la evidencia disponible y formuló 45 enunciados divididos en cinco bloques: eficacia, coste-efectividad, adhesión, seguridad y satisfacción del paciente. Un grupo validador de 71 expertos evaluó estas recomendaciones mediante el método Delphi en dos rondas. Los panelistas calificaron cada enunciado en una escala de 9 puntos para determinar su grado de acuerdo.
Resultados
Se alcanzó consenso en 42 de los 45 enunciados. Los panelistas mostraron amplio acuerdo en la eficacia de la TT en dispositivo único para mejorar la función pulmonar y reducir exacerbaciones, así como en su buen perfil de coste-efectividad y de adhesión al tratamiento. La seguridad de la TT fue considerada favorable, incluso en pacientes con comorbilidades cardiovasculares. Los panelistas también estuvieron de acuerdo en la importancia de la satisfacción del paciente con el dispositivo inhalador. Sin embargo, no se alcanzó consenso sobre la idoneidad de la TT como tratamiento de primera línea, ni sobre si la TT es más beneficiosa que el aumento de dosis de CSI en pacientes con un perfil inflamatorio bajo que ya reciben doble terapia. Además, los panelistas no estuvieron de acuerdo en que la baja laboral por causas respiratorias estuviera asociada con una mayor adhesión a la TT en dispositivo único.
Conclusiones
El consenso indica que la TT en un solo dispositivo se considera una opción efectiva y segura para el tratamiento del asma, mejorando la adherencia y la satisfacción del paciente. Se destaca la necesidad de más estudios en vida real para evaluar su implementación en diferentes contextos clínicos.}

abstract = {Background
Vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) present a resurgent threat to global health security and jeopardize decades of advancements in public health and economic development. Since 1974, childhood vaccinations are estimated to have prevented 154 million deaths from VPD, yet recent declines in routine vaccination rates highlight the global population's growing vulnerability to these diseases. When paired with appropriate access to healthcare and trusted information, evidence informed enforceable policies have demonstrably improved childhood vaccination rates in countries that have recently implemented more stringent laws on routine vaccination. Here we comprehensively map and describe the current legal environment for childhood vaccination.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the childhood vaccination-related policies in 194 countries. Policies were systematically identified, collated, and categorized into a publicly available tool.
Results
A total of 106 countries have legally-enforceable policies requiring vaccination for at least one disease. We found that vaccines against diphtheria, measles, and tetanus were the most universally mandated, while vaccines against COVID-19 and Japanese Encephalitis were mandated by the fewest countries. In 91 countries, childhood vaccination requirements are enforced through either legal sanctions, such as monetary fines or incarceration, through exclusion from congregate settings, or through some combination of the two.
Conclusion
Analyses of the efficacy of childhood vaccination laws are predicated upon a comprehensive mapping of the current legal landscape related to routine immunization. Public health officials and researchers with an interest in increasing routine childhood vaccination rates in their country must know what characteristics of policy have been effective across various contexts. Our mapping of legally-enforceable childhood vaccination policies is foundational for assessing current vulnerabilities to vaccine-preventable diseases and future policy analyses.}

abstract = {Geological carbon storage (GCS) is a crucial technology for addressing environmental challenges caused by greenhouse gas. In the site selection phase for GCS projects, the saturation of irreducible water is a vital indicator used to calculate the storage capacity and assess the feasibility of GCS projects. Due to its high efficiency in characterizing the petrophysical properties of porous rocks, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology is an indispensable tool for analyzing irreducible water. However, limited core samples and time-consuming experiments result in scarce matched NMR data from centrifuged and saturated states, challenging the study of irreducible water for GCS projects through machine learning. Moreover, the traditional single T2 cutoff methods for determining irreducible water saturation exhibit significant errors, making precise calculation of storage capacity challenging. To overcome these obstacles, the application of Generative Adversarial Networks is proposed to enhance training data richness and lay a foundation for using machine learning to investigate irreducible water properties. When selecting the appropriate data form and network structure, amplitude variations in T2 distributions at saturated and centrifuged states were considered, and the generator and discriminator models developed with the data form of type 1 showed the best performance. Furthermore, the Random Forest algorithm is introduced to predict the tapered T2 cutoff value, further deriving the T2 distribution of irreducible water and ultimately yielding more accurate irreducible water saturation. This accurate assessment is essential for calculating both static and dynamic storage capacities, which provide critical benchmarks for project operators in source-sink matching, ensuring efficient and cost-effective storage objectives. Additionally, it enables the acquisition of the T2 distribution of free water, which is difficult to obtain with traditional methods. This extra information can provide more guidance for the site selection and injection phases of GCS projects. The proposed method, by integrating advanced machine learning techniques, offers significant improvements over traditional methods in investigating irreducible water properties, presenting a promising application outlook in GCS projects.}

This study investigates the impact of user experience on user stickiness in governmental chatbots, employing a segmented, scenario-based approach to assess variations across different user groups and technology levels. By analyzing data from groups with either practical or policy-oriented knowledge, the study explores how the integration of basic and advanced artificial intelligence technologies influences the retention of users interacting with governmental digital services. The core findings reveal that user experience significantly enhances user stickiness across all scenarios and user types, independent of the users' level of online institutionalized political participation. This study indicates that the effectiveness of user experience strategies in governmental chatbots is largely autonomous from the users' political engagement, suggesting that the intrinsic quality of the user interface is a more critical factor in promoting user retention than previously understood.}

abstract = {Background
Nephrolithiasis is not a well-documented condition in children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is possible that this condition was underestimated before the era of nusinersen because of a much shorter life expectancy. We present our observational data on nephrolithiasis and its possible risk factors in children with type 1 SMA.
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 20 children with genetically confirmed type 1 SMA. Thirteen patients (aged 9 to 55 months) who underwent urinary tract ultrasonography were included in the study. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographic and clinical characteristics, ultrasound results, and metabolic abnormalities.
Results
Seven children (54%) had nephrolithiasis; 5 had multiple stones and two had a single stone. Two patients had microlithiasis (<3 mm), three had a stone in the size of 3 to 5 mm, and one had a stone in the size of more than 8 mm. Two patients with nephrolithiasis had urinary tract abnormalities. Patients with nephrolithiasis were more likely to have a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) (P = 0.048) and higher urine specific gravity (P = 0.014) than patients without nephrolithiasis. Five of seven children with nephrolithiasis had a urine metabolic evaluation; all had hypercalciuria, three had hyperuricosuria, but none had hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, or hypomagnesemia.
Conclusion
Children with SMA type 1 are at an increased risk for nephrolithiasis. Hypercalciuria and high urine specific gravity appear to be the most common risk factors for the occurrence of nephrolithiasis. In addition, UTI is more common in patients with type 1 SMA with nephrolithiasis.}

abstract = {Hypothesis
Although antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of new antibiotics, their inherent susceptibility to degradation requires nanocarrier-mediated delivery. While cubosome nanocarriers have been extensively studied for delivery of AMPs, we do not currently understand why cubosome encapsulation improves antimicrobial efficacy for some compounds but not others. This study therefore aims to investigate the link between the mechanism of action and permeation efficiency of the peptides, their encapsulation efficacy, and the antimicrobial activity of these systems.
Experiments
Encapsulation and delivery of Indolicidin, and its ultra-short derivative, Priscilicidin, were investigated using SAXS, cryo-TEM and circular dichroism. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to understand the loading of these peptides within cubosomes. The antimicrobial efficacy was assessed against gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive (MRSA) bacteria.
Findings
A high ionic strength solution was required to facilitate high loading of the cationic AMPs, with bilayer encapsulation driven by tryptophan and Fmoc moieties. Cubosome encapsulation did not improve the antimicrobial efficacy of the AMPs consistent with their high permeation, as explained by a recent ’diffusion to capture model’. This suggests that cubosome encapsulation may not be an effective strategy for all antimicrobial compounds, paving the way for improved selection of nanocarriers for AMPs, and other antimicrobial compounds.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Children undergoing orthopedic procedures often present numerous risk factors for thromboembolism. A recent survey, conducted by the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA), indicates that pediatric orthopedic surgeons are unaware of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention protocols and feel that certain procedures should require thromboprophylaxis. The aim of this systematic review was to properly assess the incidence of VTE in pediatric orthopedics. By using a thorough and broad search of the literature, the incidence according to different subspecialties of pediatric orthopedics was evaluated.
Methods
A systematic review on VTE in pediatric orthopedics was conducted. Four databases were searched for articles reporting these events. Three major search concepts: “pediatrics”, “orthopedic surgery/trauma” and “VTE complications” were used and broken down in MeSH, EmTree and their free vocabulary synonyms for proper literature review. Two independent authors screened 8467 titles and abstracts. Seventy articles reporting VTE in children treated by orthopedic surgeons were selected for data extraction. We reported median incidences by orthopedic subtypes and by study characteristics with a semi-quantitative review model.
Results
The 70 articles yielded a total of 845,010 participants. Spine articles (33/70) provided 25,2% of the children included in the review. Trauma studies (16/70) accounted for 47.5% of the participants. The overall VTE median incidence was 0.16% [95% CI: 0.0–1.01%]. Musculoskeletal infections had a noticeably higher median incidence of 3.5% [CI: 0.0–13.8%]. Small variations were seen for the other subtypes: trauma, spine and elective surgeries. Subgroups by article characteristics did not differ significantly either.
Conclusion
Thrombotic complications are rare events in pediatric orthopedics, but knowledge epidemiologic is important because its potential severity. In this review, VTE median incidence for all orthopedic subtypes was around 0.16% [CI: 0.0–1.01%]. According to subspecialty assessment, musculoskeletal infections were associated with greater risk of VTE occurrence.

Routine knee MRI protocols for 1.5 T and 3 T scanners, do not include T2*-w gradient echo (T2*W) images, which are useful in several clinical scenarios such as the assessment of cartilage, synovial blooming (deposition of hemosiderin), chondrocalcinosis and the evaluation of the physis in pediatric patients. Herein, we aimed to develop an open-source deep learning model that creates synthetic T2*W images of the knee using fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted images.
Materials and Methods
A cycleGAN model was trained with 12,118 sagittal knee MR images and tested on an independent set of 2996 images. Diagnostic interchangeability of synthetic T2*W images was assessed against a series of findings. Voxel intensity of four tissues was evaluated with Bland–Altman plots. Image quality was assessed with the use of root mean squared error (NRMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Code, model and a standalone executable file are provided on github.
Results
The model achieved a median NRMSE, PSNR and SSIM of 0.5, 17.4, and 0.5, respectively. Images were found interchangeable with an intraclass correlation coefficient >0.95 for all findings. Mean voxel intensity was equal between synthetic and conventional images. Four types of artifacts were identified: geometrical distortion (86/163 cases), object insertion/omission (11/163 cases), a wrap-around-like (26/163 cases) and an incomplete fat-suppression artifact (120/163 cases), which had a median 0 impact (no impact) on the diagnosis.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the developed open-source GAN model creates synthetic T2*W images of the knee of high diagnostic value and quality. The identified artifacts had no or minor effect on the diagnostic value of the images.}

As the metaverse has garnered considerable attention, many metaverse platforms have explosively launched. The intensified competition among metaverse platforms is increasing the value of third-party developers, who play a role of complementors in platform ecosystems as creating virtual properties. Despite the significant role of developers in the sustainability of these nascent metaverse platforms, our understanding of their choice of platforms remains sparse. The study employed an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is widely recognized for its efficiency in evaluating and ranking criteria at various levels within a hierarchical structure, aiding in systematic decision-making. The study scrutinizes not only the weights of three evaluation criteria (market attractiveness, technological readiness, and platform readiness), which have been commonly used in research on platform complementors, along with their sub-criteria, but also probes into developers' ultimate choice of specific platforms. Findings show that while user size, a sub-criterion of market attractiveness, emerges as the most crucial factor, the support of the developer community is less significant, differing from previous research findings. The study not only significantly enhances our understanding of the contemporary metaverse ecosystem, but also enriches knowledge of platform complementors.}

Responses to COVID-19 within medical education prompted significant changes to the surgical clerkship. We analyzed the changes in medical student end of course feedback before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods
Postclerkship surveys from 2017 to 2022 were analyzed including both Likert scale data and free text, excluding the COVID outbreak year 2019-2020. Likert scale questions were compared between pre-COVID (2017-2019) and COVID-era cohorts (2020-2022) with the Mann–Whitney U-test. Free-text comments were analyzed using both thematic analysis and natural language processing including sentiment, word and phrase frequency, and topic modeling.
Results
Of the 483 medical students surveyed from 2017 to 2022, 297 responded (61% response rate) to the included end of clerkship surveys. Most medical students rated the clerkship above average or excellent with no significant difference between the pre-COVID and COVID-era cohorts (70.4% Versus 64.8%, P = 0.35). Perception of grading expectations did significantly differ, 51% of pre-COVID students reported clerkship grading standards were almost always clear compared to 27.5% of COVID-era students (P = 0.01). Pre-COVID cohorts more frequently mentioned learning and feedback while COVID-era cohorts more frequently mentioned case, attending, and expectation. Natural language processing topic modeling and formal thematic analysis identified similar themes: team, time, autonomy, and expectations.
Conclusions
COVID-19 presented many challenges to undergraduate medical education. Despite many changes, there was no significant difference in clerkship satisfaction ratings. Unexpectedly, the greater freedom and autonomy of asynchronous lectures and choice of cases became a highlight of the new curriculum. Future research should investigate if there are similar associations nationally with a multi-institutional study.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) calcium pretreatment for preventing diltiazem-induced hypotension and assessed its safety in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
Methods
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 217 adults with AF/AFL and a ventricular rate > 120 beats per minute, who were randomized into three groups: those who received an IV NaCl 0.9 % placebo pretreatment prior to IV diltiazem (PD; 73 patients) and those who received 90 mg (C90D; 71 patients) and 180 mg (C180D; 73 patients) IV calcium chloride pretreatment before IV diltiazem. We compared participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) at baseline and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-treatment, as well as the incidence of adverse events (e.g., hypotension, urticaria, nausea) among the groups.
Results
The PD and C90D pretreatment groups had significantly lower HR measurements at 10 and 15 min compared to the C180D group. In addition, at 5 min, the mean SBP in the PD group was significantly lower compared to the C90D and C180D groups. At 10 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in the C180D group than in the other groups. Furthermore, at 15 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in both the C90D and C180D groups than in the PD group. There were no significant differences between the calcium pretreatment and placebo groups in terms of the need for additional diltiazem doses or the incidence of adverse events.
Conclusion
IV calcium pretreatment effectively prevents diltiazem-induced hypotension in patients with AF/AFL with RVR without compromising the efficacy of diltiazem in achieving and maintaining ventricular rate control.

Fasting prior to percutaneous cardiac procedures is common, despite a lack of high-quality evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the safety of a nonfasting strategy. Online databases Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar were searched. Quantitative analysis was performed using R software (Version 4.1.2) with meta package. Analyzed outcomes included nausea, vomiting, aspiration, intubation, hypoglycemia, hypotension, acute kidney injury, patient satisfaction score, and length of hospital stay. Eight randomized controlled trials were included with 3,382 patients. There was no significant difference between fasting and nonfasting for nausea/vomiting odds ratio (OR) 0.99 (95% CI, 0.68-1.45), hypoglycemia OR 1.28 (95% CI, 0.75-2.18), aspiration OR 0.72 (95% CI, 0.36-1.43), acute kidney injury OR 0.69 (95% CI, 0.38-1.23), and hypotension OR 1.57 (95% CI, 0.47-5.30). No patient in either group underwent endotracheal intubation. Additionally, there was no difference in patient satisfaction score and length of hospital stay with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.23 (95% CI, -0.62 to 1.07) and 0.0 (95% CI, -0.6 to 0.7) respectively. Sub-group analysis, however, showed increased odds of nausea/vomiting in the fasting group compared to nonfasting OR 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04-1.39) and decreased odds of acute kidney injury in fasting compared to nonfasting group OR 0.50 (95% CI, 0.28-0.89). In conclusion, this analysis shows no significant difference in most safety outcomes between a fasting and a nonfasting strategy with potential increase in nausea/vomiting and decrease in acute kidney injury with fasting. More studies are needed to better understand these differences.}

abstract = {Objectives
Stroke is the second leading cause of global death and is characterized by excitotoxic neuronal death caused by NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor overactivation. The present study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic potential of IC87201, a novel small molecule interfering with the NMDA receptor intracellular signaling pathway, in reducing the extent of ischemic stroke-induced brain damage.
Materials and Methods
Cerebral ischemia was induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method in 24 anesthetized adult male rats for one hour. The animals were randomized into sham, MCAO, MCAO+ DXM (Dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate) as an NMDA antagonist, and MCAO+ IC87201 groups which in the last two groups, DXM (50 mg/kg) and IC87201 (10 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally after ischemia. The neurobehavioral scores were appraised for 7 days and after that, brain tissue was appropriately prepared to perform the stereological evaluations.
Results
The administration of IC87201 significantly recovered post-ischemia damages, including neurobehavioral function, reduction of volume of the total hemisphere, cortex, and striatum in rat brain, and the percentage of infarcted areas. Additionally, in the striatum region, IC87201 caused an increase in the total number of neuronal and non-neuronal cells as well as a decrease in the total number of dead cells. Some of these parameters were improved by DXM, but in general, IC87201 outperformed that.
Conclusions
IC87201 was successful in minimizing ischemia-induced damage, especially in the striatal region. In addition, IC87201, as a molecule that acts on the intracellular signaling cascade of the NMDA receptor, performed better than DXM, as an antagonist of this receptor.}

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity in elderly individuals and remain a persistent challenge for medical professionals. This study aimed to identify the bacteria causing community-acquired (CA) UTIs in older patients, determine their antimicrobial resistance patterns, assess the prevalence of polymicrobial infections, and identify the risk factors.
Methods
Urine samples were obtained from patients with symptomatic UTIs and then cultured on blood and MacConkey agar. Positive cultures were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the VITEK 2 system.
Results
Polymicrobial infections were found in 69/427 (16.16 %) of older patients with CA-UTIs and associated with diabetes (p = 0.007), previous antimicrobial use (p = 0.025), and recurrent urinary infections (p = 0.043). Escherichia coli was the leading pathogen (57.26 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified in 15.32 % of CA-UTIs. Escherichia coli was more common in non-diabetic patients (60.81 %) than diabetes (43.69 %). However, the rates of Klebsiella species were higher in diabetes (20.39 %) than non-diabetes (14.50 %). Gram-negative uropathogens showed 49.89 % resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, while imipenem is the least resistant (7.19 %). The gram-positive uropathogens were resistant to 9.80 % of linezolid and highly resistant to erythromycin (74.51 %), tetracycline (72.55 %), and gentamicin (70.59 %).
Conclusions
Escherichia coli isolates were the predominant bacteria in the elderly and highly resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic. The most effective drug against gram-negative bacteria was imipenem, while linezolid proved potently effective against gram-positive bacteria. Diabetes, previous antimicrobial use, and recurrent urinary infections are risk factors for polymicrobial UTIs.}

Nevertheless, as the network becomes deeper, it is easy to cause training over-fitting and performance saturation, particularly in the case of insufficient training data. In this paper, we report the design of a new network, namely parallel deraining convolutional neural network (PARDNet), for single-image deraining. Specifically, PARDNet adopts two parallel residual sub-networks based on different receptive fields to extract more comprehensive characteristics of the rain streaks, as well as decrease the depth of the network. The hybrid dilated convolution is employed to enlarge the sub-network’s receptive field to capture more context information. The efficient channel attention module is integrated into the proposed PARDNet to capture rain streaks more effectively and preserve more background details. Furthermore, to facilitate the network training, the residual learning is also fused into PARDNet in a holistic way. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PARDNet for single-image deraining.}

The main goal underpinning such protocols is to protect the Internet connections between IoE machines from malicious activities such as unauthorized eavesdropping, monitoring, and tampering with messages. In theory, these protocols are supposed to be secure. Still, most existing implementations partially follow the standard features of (D)TLS 1.2/3, leaving them vulnerable to risks such as side-channel and network attacks. In this paper, we critically review the standard protocols deployed for the security management of data and connected machines, and also examine the recently discovered vulnerabilities that lead to successful zero-day attacks in IoE environments. Then, we discuss various potential countermeasures in the form of organizational policy enforcement strategies and mitigation approaches that can be used by cybersecurity practitioners, decision- and policy-makers.

abstract = {Aims
Suicide is a global public health concern, accounting for nearly 700,000 deaths annually. Although well-established risk factors, including mental health disorders, are widely recognized, emerging concerns have surfaced regarding a potential association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), the dual Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 Receptor Agonist tirzepatide and suicidal behavior. This systematic review aims to synthesize the available evidence on the potential association between these drugs and suicidal behavior.
Methods
This review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and APA PsycInfo up to September 24, 2024, using terms related to GLP-1 RAs/GIP/GLP-1 RAs and suicidal behavior.Three independent reviewers conducted article screening and data extraction. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and ROB2 for RCTs.
Results
The review identified 16 studies published between 2017 and 2024, consisting of 5 observational studies, 2 randomized controlled trials, 8 pharmacovigilance analyses, and 1 post-hoc analysis of RCTs. No consistent evidence indicated an increased suicide risk among GLP-1 RA users. Pharmacovigilance analyses produced mixed findings; while some disproportionality analyses reported higher rates relative to other antihyperglycemic drugs, no causal link was confirmed. Cohort studies involving diabetic and obese populations generally did not demonstrate a significant increase in suicidal behavior.
Conclusions
Although current data do not warrant changes in prescribing practices, further research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Moreover, the generalizability and reliability of these findings should be interpreted in light of the methodological limitations of the included studies.}

Albumin is a relatively small molecule with a radius of 7.5 nm and a molecular weight of 65 kDa. It is the most abundant protein in plasma, accounting for 60–75% of its oncotic pressure. Its concentration in plasma is merely one static measurement reflecting a dynamic and complex system of albumin physiology, and is the net result of several different processes, one or more of which may become deranged by disease or its treatment. It is also unsurprising that hypoalbuminaemia has proved to be an indicator of morbidity and mortality risk since the underlying conditions which cause it, including protein energy malnutrition, crystalloid overload, inflammation, and liver dysfunction are themselves risk factors. In some cases, its underlying cause may require treatment but mostly it is just a parameter to be monitored and used as one measure of clinical progress or deterioration. While malnutrition, associated with a low protein intake, may be a contributory cause of hypoalbuminaemia, in the absence of inflammation and/or dilution with crystalloid its development in response to malnutrition alone is slow compared with the rapid change caused by inflammatory redistribution or dilution with crystalloids. Other significant causes include liver dysfunction and serous losses. These causal factors may occur singly or in combination in any particular case. Treatment is that of the underlying causes and associated conditions such as a low plasma volume, not of hypoalbuminaemia per se.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the main cause of mortality attributable to air pollution. This study analyzes, for the first time, the association between levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles ≤ 2.5μm in diameter) and hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in hospitals of the Spanish National Health System.
Methods
Data on air pollution, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, covering the period from 2016 to 2021. A total of 122 National Health System hospitals were geographically matched with environmental monitoring stations located within a 10km radius. The study included 115 071 patients aged 18 years or older (mean age, 67 years; 28% women) who were discharged with a diagnosis of AMI during the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to each hospital, and a meta-analysis was conducted to consolidate the estimates of the association between PM2.5 levels and variations in AMI hospital admissions. The association between PM2.5 pollution and in-hospital AMI mortality was analyzed using logistic regression models.
Results
Maximum 3-day average PM2.5 levels exceeding 10μg/m3 were associated with an additional 21.9 AMI hospital admissions per 1000 (95%CI, 9.1-34.8; P<.001). Furthermore, PM2.5 levels above 25μg/m3 (3-day moving average) were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality due to AMI (OR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.07-1.23; P<.001).
Conclusions
This study identifies a significant association between elevated PM2.5 levels and increased hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality due to AMI in Spain, highlighting the importance of reducing air pollution as a critical factor in cardiovascular health.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La enfermedad vascular ateroesclerótica es la principal causa de mortalidad atribuida a la contaminación atmosférica. Este estudio analiza por primera vez la asociación entre los niveles de contaminación por material particulado ≤ 2,5 μm de diámetro (PM2,5), y la frecuentación y mortalidad hospitalaria por infarto agudo de miocardio (IAM) en hospitales del Sistema Nacional de Salud en España.
Métodos
Se utilizaron datos de contaminación atmosférica, temperatura y humedad obtenidos del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, recopilados entre 2016 y 2021. Se asociaron 122 hospitales del Sistema Nacional de Salud con estaciones de mediciones ambientales ubicadas en un radio de 10km mediante coordenadas geográficas. La muestra incluyó a 115.071 pacientes ≥18 años (edad media de 67 años, el 28% mujeres) dados de alta con diagnóstico de IAM durante el periodo de estudio. Se aplicó un modelo autorregresivo integrado de promedio móvil (ARIMA) para cada hospital y un metanálisis para consolidar las estimaciones de asociación entre los valores de PM2,5 y las variaciones en los ingresos hospitalarios por IAM. La asociación de la contaminación por PM2,5 con mortalidad hospitalaria por IAM se analizó mediante modelos de regresión logística.
Resultados
Los niveles de contaminación máxima >10μg/m3 en el promedio de 3 días se asociaron con un aumento de 21,9 por 1.000 ingresos hospitalarios por IAM (IC95%, 9,1-34,8; p<0,001). Además, los valores de PM2,5 >25μg/m3 (media móvil de 3 días previos) se asociaron con un incremento del riesgo de mortalidad hospitalaria por IAM (OR=1,14; IC95%, 1,07-1,23; p<0,001).
Conclusiones
Este estudio establece una asociación significativa entre altos valores de PM2,5 y un aumento tanto en la frecuentación como en la mortalidad hospitalarias por IAM en España, destacando la importancia de abordar la contaminación atmosférica como un factor clave en la salud cardiovascular.}

Analysing natural breathing offers a valuable alternative but requires new methodological approaches. This study introduces anharmonic morphological analysis, a novel technique to characterise breathing cycles, and evaluates its reliability and ability to distinguish healthy individuals from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Twenty healthy individuals (17 men; age 28 ± 5 years; body mass index 21 ± 2 kg/m²) and 119 COPD patients (covering all spirometric GOLD stages) were studied during natural breathing using a linear pneumotachograph. Ventilatory flow traces were analysed using anharmonic morphological analysis, enabling the reconstruction of an average ventilatory cycle for each individual (personal respiratory profile, PRP). Comparisons were performed by calculating Euclidean distances between PRPs. Anharmonic morphological analysis enabled precise and reproducible characterisation of ventilatory cycles. PRPs showed high temporal stability. Tessellation based on Euclidean distances distinguished healthy individuals from COPD patients with a sensitivity of 86 % and a specificity of 94 %. Exploratory analyses further suggested the potential of the method to identify COPD patients responsive to bronchodilator administration based on inspiratory capacity changes. Anharmonic morphological analysis offers a reproducible, physiologically meaningful description of natural breathing and shows promise for future development as a spontaneous-breathing-based tool to assist in diagnosing respiratory disorders without requiring patient cooperation.}

The study finds that the integration of e-commerce into rural areas significantly promotes pension security for the elderly, while financial literacy also effectively enhances their pension security. Moderation effect analysis indicates that financial literacy plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between rural e-commerce and pension security among the elderly, with this moderating effect exhibiting notable heterogeneity across different levels of household debt and marital statuses within the elderly population. The research contributes a fresh understanding of the complex interplay between e-commerce integration in rural settings, individual financial literacy, and the pension security of the elderly. Concurrently, it furnishes empirical evidence crucial for the formulation of policies designed to enhance elder financial stability.}

Eighty cases of PDAC, 46 cases of chronic pancreatitis and 53 normal pancreatic tissue were immunohistochemically assessed using NCOA3, Maspin and VHL antibodies on sections from a tissue microarray. NCOA3, Maspin and VHL were positive in 90 %, 100 % and 35 %, of PDAC cases respectively, whereas NCOA3, Maspin and VHL expressions were positive in 3.8 %, 0 and 100 % of normal pancreatic tissue and in 15.2 %, 21.7 % and 97.8 % of chronic pancreatitis cases respectively. Significant differences were observed between PDAC and other groups regarding NCOA3, Maspin and VHL expression (p < 0.001). The H scores of NCOA3, Maspin and VHL could significantly distinguish between PDAC and normal cases with high sensitivity (90 %, 100 % and 98.75 % respectively) and specificity (100 %, 100 % and 96.23 % respectively). Similar findings were found in the distinction between PDAC and chronic pancreatitis (Sensitivity: 90 %, 95.25 % and 98.75 %; specificity: 100 %, 100 % and 93.48 % for NCOA3, Maspin and VHL respectively). In conclusion, NCOA3 and Maspin were found to be significantly expressed in PDAC compared to non-tumorous tissue while VHL was significantly expressed in non-tumorous tissue.

Mortality rates were standardized against the 2010 census population of China (ASMRC) and Segi's world population (ASMRW). Joinpoint regression models were used to analyze temporal trends. Our findings indicated an estimated 14,568 MM-related deaths in China. The observed crude mortality rates ASMRC, and ASMRW were 1.04, 0.80, and 0.62 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. A notable sex-related difference in mortality rates was evident, with male mortalities (8,319) surpassing female mortalities (6,249) by a factor of 1.33. Age-wise, mortality rates tended to increase after 55 years, reaching a maximum in those over 85 years (7.09 per 100,000 individuals). Provincial data revealed that the highest ASMRCs were in Zhejiang, Beijing, and Jiangxi, whereas the lowest were in Tibet, Qinghai, and Hainan. The period from 2013 to 2020 exhibited a significant increase of 58.09 % in MM mortality, with urban and rural areas exhibiting a 44.97 % and 70.94 % increase, respectively.

abstract = {Objectives
Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual, has never been studied in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As IC decline is associated with the risk of frailty, functional decline and disability and is potentially reversible after targeted interventions, a monitoring and specific management of IC decline in patients with DLB could promote healthy aging in this population. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the frequency of IC decline in DLB and to compare it with AD.
Design
A single-center cross-sectional study.
Setting
This study was carried out in a memory clinic between 2015 and 2023 based on the MEMORA cohort.
Participants
Patients with a diagnosis of AD or probable DLB and a comprehensive geriatric assessment.
Measurements
IC was assessed according to the WHO model in 4 domains: vitality assessed by the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), locomotion assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), psychology assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale 4-items (GDS-4 items), and hearing assessed by the Hearing, Vision, Equilibrium and Cognition (HVEC) scale.
Results
A total of 798 patients (154 with probable DLB and 644 with AD) were included, and the mean age was 81.4 years (SD 6.33). Compared with AD patients, DLB patients had significantly more impaired IC in all domains, with greater risks of impaired vitality (odds ratio (OR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60–3.72), locomotion (OR 3.50, 95% CI 2.15–5.90), psychology (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.73–3.92) and hearing (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.53–3.49), according to the adjusted models. Similarly, when IC domains were considered linear variables, IC across all domains was significantly lower in the DLB group than in the AD group.
Conclusion
This study revealed that DLB patients presented a greater decrease in IC than did AD patients across all domains. In memory clinics, DLB patients could be offered systematic and early IC monitoring and personalized interventions.}

For example, supply chain data are used for analysis of shock propagation through national and global economies as well as for achieving sustainability goals, cross-industry ripple effects become of increasing importance in light of global geopolitical uncertainties, and supply chain resilience analysis takes the lens of global ecosystem viability. These and many other examples of connecting business and macroeconomic perspectives of supply chains allow generalizing a novel research area: Supply Chain Economics.

abstract = {Background
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled development of natural language algorithms capable of generating coherent texts. We evaluated the quality, validity, and safety of this generative AI in preoperative anaesthetic planning.
Methods
In this exploratory, single-centre, convergent mixed-method study, 10 clinical vignettes were randomly selected, and ChatGPT (OpenAI, 4.0) was prompted to create anaesthetic plans, including cardiopulmonary risk assessment, intraoperative anaesthesia technique, and postoperative management. A quantitative assessment compared these plans with those made by eight senior anaesthesia consultants. A qualitative assessment was performed by an adjudication committee through focus group discussion and thematic analysis. Agreement on cardiopulmonary risk assessment was calculated using weighted Kappa, with descriptive data representation for other outcomes.
Results
ChatGPT anaesthetic plans showed variable agreement with consultants' plans. ChatGPT, the survey panel, and adjudication committee frequently disagreed on cardiopulmonary risk estimation. The ChatGPT answers were repetitive and lacked variety, evidenced by the strong preference for general anaesthesia and absence of locoregional techniques. It also showed inconsistent choices regarding airway management, postoperative analgesia, and medication use. While some differences were not deemed clinically significant, subpar postoperative pain management advice and failure to recommend tracheal intubation for patients at high risk for pulmonary aspiration were considered inappropriate recommendations.
Conclusions
Preoperative anaesthetic plans generated by ChatGPT did not consistently meet minimum clinical standards and were unlikely the result of clinical reasoning. Therefore, ChatGPT is currently not recommended for preoperative planning. Future large language models trained on anaesthesia-specific datasets might improve performance but should undergo vigorous evaluation before use in clinical practice.}

To improve the performance of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for both uniform linear and planar arrays, an innovative design approach for active coupling radar arrays is proposed. The proposed approach employs active coupling to increase the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and expand the phase difference between array elements, without introducing any additional output loss, by designing appropriate active coupling gains. The experimental results show that the actively-coupled radar array adopting the proposed approach can achieve higher output SNR and narrower beam width than the same array without the proposed technique. Moreover, using the proposed method, the detection SNR threshold can be significantly improved, thus ensuring more accurate DOA estimation. This work paves the way for potentially more accurate DOA estimation in radar systems with limited antenna spacing.}

Recently, a few generative AI tools such as UrbanistAI, PlacemakingAI, and Laneform have been developed to overcome these limitations, generating real-time street layout visualizations. These tools aim to enhance stakeholder and citizen involvement in street design processes by allowing citizens to easily modify street layouts and visualize how the street could be in the future. Even though these tools may increase efficiency in design generation, their possible impacts and integration into urban planning practices are poorly questioned and studied. This viewpoint aims to outline a research agenda, discussing the challenges and potential positive and negative effects of using generative AI in participatory decision-making for street designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that discusses the possible benefits and impacts of these generative AI tools for generating future street design. We believe that integrating generative AI street design participation tools into urban planning processes has yet to be thoroughly understood, particularly in their impact on people's creativity and problem-solving, adaptability to different contexts, alignment with recent AI regulations, and implications for equity.}

A total of 259 serum samples were collected from adult goats in 42 family farms in nine communities and tested for indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT, cut-off 1:100). Seroprevalences were 34.36% (89/259) for T. gondii and 64.09% (166/259) for N. caninum. Co-infection was found in 25.86% (67/259) of the goats tested. The most frequent IFAT titer of T. gondii found was 100 (23.93%; 62/259), and only 2% (5/259) of the goats presented titer 800. For N. caninum, the most frequent titers were 100 (25.86%; 67/259), and titers 200 (20.46%; 53/259) and 400 (14.61%, 38/259). The titers found for T. gondii could suggest a chronic infection in goats, being of importance for the region due to meat consumption and cheese production. The elevated seroprevalence of N. caninum identified in this study may be attributed to the community-specific dog population and the close interaction between dogs and goats, despite the absence of a statistically significant association. Subsequent research is warranted to assess the productive implications of T. gondii and N. caninum.}

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a commonly misdiagnosed condition. Driven by cost-consciousness and technological fluency, distinct generations may gravitate towards healthcare alternatives, including artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). Our objective was to evaluate the speed and accuracy of ChatGPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5) in the diagnosis of people with NMOSD (PwNMOSD) initially misdiagnosed.
Methods
Misdiagnosed PwNMOSD were retrospectively identified with clinical symptoms and time line of medically related events processed through GPT-3.5. For each subject, seven digital derivatives representing different races, ethnicities, and sexes were created and processed identically to evaluate the impact of these variables on accuracy. Scoresheets were used to track diagnostic success and time to diagnosis. Diagnostic speed of GPT-3.5 was evaluated against physicians using a Cox proportional hazards model, clustered by subject. Logistical regression was used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of GPT-3.5 compared with the estimated accuracy of physicians.
Results
Clinical time lines for 68 individuals (59 female, 42 Black/African American, 13 White, 11 Hispanic, 2 Asian; mean age at first symptoms 34.4 years (y) (standard deviation = 15.5y)) were analyzed and 476 digital simulations created, yielding 544 conversations for analysis. The instantaneous probability of correct diagnosis was 70.65% less for physicians relative to GPT-3.5 within 240 days of symptom onset (p < 0.0001). The estimated probability of correct diagnosis for GPT-3.5 was 80.88% [95% CI = (76.35%, 99.81%)].
Conclusion
GPT-3.5 may be of value in recognizing NMOSD. However, the manner in which medical information is conveyed, combined with the potential for inaccuracies may result in unnecessary psychological stress.}

However, a significant limitation of many existing models is their exclusive reliance on historical motion data, which may lead to undesirable outcomes such as pedestrians intersecting with roadside features. Furthermore, current research predominantly relies on spatial assumptions, making it challenging to adjust the graph arrangement for un-specified environments in online systems, and there is a notable absence of an evaluation methodology to assess the impact of relational modeling on prediction execution. This study addresses these limitations by developing a trajectory prediction model incorporating environmental factors affecting pedestrians. The proposed 3D-dual contextualized model (DCM) utilizes adaptive relational aggregation to capture the intricate relationships between pedestrians and their contextual data. Moreover, integrating a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with the Pedestrian Visual Acuity Module (PVAM) aims to replicate pedestrians’ perception of their surroundings, eliminating extraneous data and reducing computational complexity. Supplementary environmental data was introduced to enrich the information set. Evaluation of the dataset demonstrates that the proposed model, incorporating dual-contextualized information such as background and vision information, outperforms the prediction accuracy of cutting-edge baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the 3D-DCM outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly in scenarios with dynamic crowd behavior and environmental influences. This work contributes to the advancement of trajectory prediction by providing a robust framework that incorporates both environmental and visual data, setting the stage for more accurate and scalable applications in intelligent transportation systems and autonomous driving.}

abstract = {Background
Evidence-based tube feeding (TF) weaning involves reducing the volume of tube feeds to induce hunger, with interdisciplinary monitoring to allow for proactive medical, nutritional, and behavioral intervention as needed. This can be done outpatient; however, the current standard of care requires a high degree of medical monitoring and care coordination, which can be challenging to implement. The CHAMP App is a mobile app designed for remote patient monitoring of children born with congenital heart conditions who are at high risk for medical morbidity and mortality. The CHAMP App remote patient monitoring program would be ideally suited to improve medical monitoring and care coordination.
Objective
This study aims to determine the feasibility of adapting the CHAMP App for children ready to wean from TF.
Methods
We used the Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework as a formative tool and conducted a case study beta test.
Results
The level of complexity for the digital innovation’s adaptation supported a high likelihood of success for the TF population. Most issues were simple, such as expanding the types of data that could be entered into the app, and some were more complicated, for instance, training all relevant staff to use and maintain the technology. The case study beta test was conducted with “Greyson”, a 10-month old child weaning from TF (name changed for confidentiality). Once a week, the team reviewed the parent-entered data and communicated with Greyson’s parents, recommending a 25% reduction in tube feeding each week. With the CHAMP App facilitating 2-way communication between the family and the team, Greyson successfully transitioned from receiving 30% of his feeds orally and 70% via tube feeding to 100% oral feedings over the course of 1 month in a home setting.
Conclusions
The CHAMP App is likely to be incredibly valuable in TF weaning. The NASSS framework helped identify key considerations for adapting the CHAMP App for TF weaning at a Midwestern children’s hospital. Interviews with the health care team highlighted issues like data entry expansion and staff training. The framework confirmed TF weaning as a suitable application with no major barriers. The CHAMP App successfully supported a test patient, Greyson, in weaning from his feeding tube. It may improve access, communication efficiency, and satisfaction among families and health care teams while reducing costs and enhancing safety monitoring. The app could also make TF weaning more accessible to families with lower health literacy.}

Digital health literacy describes an individual’s ability to use digital information and tools to improve their own health. Understanding how digital health literacy varies across populations could help improve health equity. However, the determinants of digital health literacy have been scarcely evaluated.
Objective
This study aims to assess the levels of digital health literacy in 4 countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Germany) and explore potential associations between digital health literacy and demographic characteristics and self-perceived health status.
Methods
A cross-sectional online survey was disseminated to participants from the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and Sweden in December 2020. Digital health literacy was self-reported using the validated eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; range: 0-40); low digital health literacy has been previously defined as an eHEALS score<26. Participant characteristics collected were sex, age group, ethnicity, country, and perceived overall health status. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between these variables and digital health literacy.
Results
A total of 6331 participants were included (51.7% female, n=3272). The mean eHEALS score was 29.2 (SD 6.8). Participant age, sex, health status, and country of residence were included in the final multivariable model. Compared to the 45- to 54-year age group, the 55 years and older age group had lower digital health literacy (β=–1.0; 95% CI –1.4 to –0.5; P<.001), while digital health literacy was higher in those aged 25-34 years (β=0.9; 95% CI 0.3-1.5; P=.002) and 35-44 years (β=0.6; 95% CI 0.1-1.2; P=.03). Better health status was associated with greater digital health literacy (β=0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.4; P<.001). Compared to participants from Germany, those from the United Kingdom (β=2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.5; P<.001) and Sweden (β=2.9; 95% CI 2.4-3.4; P<.001) had higher digital health literacy scores, while there was no difference with Italian participants (P=.399). Sex and ethnicity did not have any significant effect on digital health literacy.
Conclusions
This study found significant variations in digital health literacy by age, health status, and country of residence. Targeted educational programs for vulnerable groups, particularly those of older age and poorer health status, are essential. Policies fostering accessible digital health solutions and mitigating health technology–related uncertainties for these populations are crucial for achieving optimal health outcomes.}

abstract = {Backgrounds
Magnetic controlled growing rods (MCGRs) have been proven to be effective in controlling early onset neuromuscular scoliosis but no study has evaluated the combination with a sacro-bi-iliac construct. The aim of our study is to report surgical management of early onset non-walkers neuromuscular scoliosis correction using MCGRs associated with a sacro-bi-iliac “T-construct” and its mid-term outcomes. Our hypothesis was that this set-up provided well correction of the pelvic obliquity and that this correction was maintained over time.
Methods
A retrospective single-center study was conducted including all consecutive neuromuscular early onset scoliosis who underwent spinopelvic fixation using “T-construct” with two MCGRS. Four millimeters lengthening was performed every 4 months during outpatient clinics sessions. All children had a low-dose biplanar stereoradiography in EOS-Chair at pre/postoperative phase, each outpatient clinic appointment and last follow-up.
Results
Eighteen patients were included and 17 analyzed at the last follow-up. The mean age at surgery was 9.5 (range from 5 to 12 years), the mean follow-up was 4,7 years (range from 2.5 to 6.6 years) and 8 patients had a Risser stage above four. The global complication rate was 35% (N = 6/17 patients) including three medical and three mechanical complications related to “T-construct”, while the reoperation rate was 18% (N = 2 patients for wound debridement and one for iterative pelvic fixation). Cobb angle and pelvic obliquity were significantly improved by surgery (mean correction was 33.2 ° (55%) and 11 ° (77%) respectively; p < 0.001). At the last follow-up, we noted a loss of frontal Cobb angle correction (p < 0.01) whereas we did not observe any significant loss of pelvic obliquity (p > 0.9).
Conclusions
Although the global complication rate was 35% (half of which are mechanical complications), the treatment combining pelvic T-construct and MCGRs provides satisfactory correction of pelvic obliquity correction, good maintenance in the medium term and may be a procedure to consider for the surgical treatment of early onset neuromuscular scoliosis.

abstract = {Background
Telemedicine, which incorporates artificial intelligence such as chatbots, offers significant potential for enhancing health care delivery. However, the efficacy of artificial intelligence chatbots compared to human physicians in clinical settings remains underexplored, particularly in complex scenarios involving patients with cancer and asynchronous text-based interactions.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the GPT-4 (OpenAI) chatbot in responding to asynchronous text-based medical messages from patients with cancer by comparing its responses with those of physicians across two clinical scenarios: patient education and medical decision-making.
Methods
We collected 4257 deidentified asynchronous text-based medical consultation records from 17 oncologists across China between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2024. Each record included patient questions, demographic data, and disease-related details. The records were categorized into two scenarios: patient education (eg, symptom explanations and test interpretations) and medical decision-making (eg, treatment planning). The GPT-4 chatbot was used to simulate physician responses to these records, with each session conducted in a new conversation to avoid cross-session interference. The chatbot responses, along with the original physician responses, were evaluated by a medical review panel (3 oncologists) and a patient panel (20 patients with cancer). The medical panel assessed completeness, accuracy, and safety using a 3-level scale, whereas the patient panel rated completeness, trustworthiness, and empathy on a 5-point ordinal scale. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for ordinal ratings.
Results
In the patient education scenario (n=2364), the chatbot scored higher than physicians in completeness (n=2301, 97.34% vs n=2213, 93.61% for fully complete responses; P=.002), with no significant differences in accuracy or safety (P>.05). In the medical decision-making scenario (n=1893), the chatbot exhibited lower accuracy (n=1834, 96.88% vs n=1855, 97.99% for fully accurate responses; P<.001) and trustworthiness (n=860, 50.71% vs n=1766, 93.29% rated as “Moderately trustworthy” or higher; P<.001) compared with physicians. Regarding empathy, the medical review panel rated the chatbot as demonstrating higher empathy scores across both scenarios, whereas the patient review panel reached the opposite conclusion, consistently favoring physicians in empathetic communication. Errors in chatbot responses were primarily due to misinterpretations of medical terminology or the lack of updated guidelines, with 3.12% (59/1893) of its responses potentially leading to adverse outcomes, compared with 2.01% (38/1893) for physicians.
Conclusions
The GPT-4 chatbot performs comparably to physicians in patient education by providing comprehensive and empathetic responses. However, its reliability in medical decision-making remains limited, particularly in complex scenarios requiring nuanced clinical judgment. These findings underscore the chatbot’s potential as a supplementary tool in telemedicine while highlighting the need for physician oversight to ensure patient safety and accuracy.}

Using the data from >50 published experiments, we estimate scalings and the performance envelope. We compare the observed scalings with several models in the literature. We find that the total beam energy (centroid energy times beam charge) scales almost linearly with laser energy, supporting the value of investment in progressively higher energy driver lasers. The dataset includes pulse durations from 8 to 160 fs, but only laser wavelengths of 800 nm and 1 µm, meaning we could not check proposed wavelength scalings for alternative laser technologies. As a benchmark next-generation case, the observed scalings suggest that achieving a 100-GeV LWFA stage will require a ≳30 PW laser operating at electron density <1017/cm3.}

It is little understood how EHP infects its host and hijacks its cellular machinery to replicate and exert clinical manifestations in infected shrimp. Since the initial record of HPM, histopathology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays were developed for the detection of EHP to prevent spread of the disease. Availability of an antibody-based detection method would complement these existing diagnostic tools and be useful in studying EHP pathogenesis. We describe here an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for detecting EHP using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that were originally developed against Cryptosporidium parvum, a coccidian parasite that infects calves (Bos taurus), other agriculturally important animals, and humans. Forty-one mAbs were screened and two mAbs, 3E2 and 3A12, were found to detect EHP successfully. The utility of these mAbs in detecting EHP was further assessed by testing 36 experimentally challenged EHP-infected shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). EHP-detection data from infected shrimp were compared by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histology, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence. The data show IFA using mAbs 3E2 and 3A12 could successfully detect EHP and that the sensitivity of detection is comparable to H&E histology and quantitative PCR. Availability of mAbs that can detect EHP is expected to be immensely beneficial in HPM diagnosis. Since the pathobiology of C. parvum has been so widely studied, these cross-reactive mAbs may also aid in gaining some insight into EHP pathogenesis and disease.}

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in various medical domains, prompting an exploration of their potential utility within the high-demand setting of emergency department (ED) triage. This study evaluated the triage proficiency of different LLMs and ChatGPT, an LLM-based chatbot, compared to professionally trained ED staff and untrained personnel. We further explored whether LLM responses could guide untrained staff in effective triage.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the efficacy of LLMs and the associated product ChatGPT in ED triage compared to personnel of varying training status and to investigate if the models’ responses can enhance the triage proficiency of untrained personnel.
Methods
A total of 124 anonymized case vignettes were triaged by untrained doctors; different versions of currently available LLMs; ChatGPT; and professionally trained raters, who subsequently agreed on a consensus set according to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). The prototypical vignettes were adapted from cases at a tertiary ED in Germany. The main outcome was the level of agreement between raters’ MTS level assignments, measured via quadratic-weighted Cohen κ. The extent of over- and undertriage was also determined. Notably, instances of ChatGPT were prompted using zero-shot approaches without extensive background information on the MTS. The tested LLMs included raw GPT-4, Llama 3 70B, Gemini 1.5, and Mixtral 8x7b.
Results
GPT-4–based ChatGPT and untrained doctors showed substantial agreement with the consensus triage of professional raters (κ=mean 0.67, SD 0.037 and κ=mean 0.68, SD 0.056, respectively), significantly exceeding the performance of GPT-3.5–based ChatGPT (κ=mean 0.54, SD 0.024; P<.001). When untrained doctors used this LLM for second-opinion triage, there was a slight but statistically insignificant performance increase (κ=mean 0.70, SD 0.047; P=.97). Other tested LLMs performed similar to or worse than GPT-4–based ChatGPT or showed odd triaging behavior with the used parameters. LLMs and ChatGPT models tended toward overtriage, whereas untrained doctors undertriaged.
Conclusions
While LLMs and the LLM-based product ChatGPT do not yet match professionally trained raters, their best models’ triage proficiency equals that of untrained ED doctors. In its current form, LLMs or ChatGPT thus did not demonstrate gold-standard performance in ED triage and, in the setting of this study, failed to significantly improve untrained doctors’ triage when used as decision support. Notable performance enhancements in newer LLM versions over older ones hint at future improvements with further technological development and specific training.}

abstract = {Background
It is well known that atrial fibrillation (AF) patients not receiving anticoagulants are at higher risk of Ischemic Stroke (IS).
Objective
Our objective is to estimate how much the Medicare program spends during one-year treating a Medicare beneficiary (MB) with AF who were not being anticoagulated prior to or during their IS hospitalization.
Methods
This cross-sectional study population consisted of all MBs in the fee-for-service program who were discharged from a hospitalization for IS having AF during 2018. Patients were excluded for a prior history of stroke or already receiving long-term anticoagulants. Medicare spending was defined as paid claims during the index hospitalization and all facility claims that began within 12-months of the index hospital discharge date even if admission occurred in 2019.
Results
The final sample was 50,509 MBs. Average Medicare Part A spending per beneficiary was $46,867 ± $49,212, for a total of nearly $2.5 billion. Highest average spending per MB was for hospital services $25,848, of which $15,790 ± $20,984 occurred during the index hospitalization, and $10,058 ± $21,956 for rehospitalization. The Medicare program average MB spending included $8131 ± $14,979 at skilled nursing facilities, $5538 ± $12,739 at rehabilitation facilities, and $3056 ± $7495 for outpatient facilities or emergency departments.
Conclusion
MBs with AF who are not treated with anticoagulants and then suffer an ischemic stroke result in one-year Medicare Part A program spending of approximately $47,000 per person compared to an average spending of approximately $12,800 per beneficiary in the Medicare program in 2018 [1]. Identification and anticoagulation treatment in AF could result in significant healthcare savings.}

To examine elevated PSA follow-up within our system and identify areas for improvement in the timely diagnosis of prostate cancer.
Methods
We queried the Mass General Brigham’s Enterprise Data Warehouse from 2018-2021, identifying patients with elevated PSA and documented time to follow-up. Timely follow-up was defined as having a urologist appointment, prostate biopsy, or prostate magnetic resonance imaging within 6 months from diagnosis. We stratified the location of elevated PSA diagnosis to academic medical centers versus community sites. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors impacting follow-up.
Results
We included 28,346 patients, with 50.30%, 15.02%, and 34.69% receiving timely, untimely, and no follow-up during the study period, respectively. In multivariable analysis, patients seen at academic medical centers were more likely to receive follow-up care (OR=1.39, 95%CI 1.30-1.48). In a sensitivity analysis including 2 of our largest community hospitals as part of academic medical facilities, those following up at our main sites showed even higher odds of timely follow-up (OR=1.61, 95%CI 1.51-1.73).
Conclusion
Our study observed variations in follow-up rate between our academic medical centers and community sites. This finding highlights the need for efforts to improve consistency and timeliness of prostate cancer follow-up care across all facilities. By addressing interfacility disparities, we can facilitate the delivery of timely care to all patients.}

The entry of SRLVs into target cells involves the mannose receptor (MR), while catalytic polypeptide-like 3 protein containing Z1 domain (A3Z1) is considered a restriction factor for lentiviral replication. The objective of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution of AlOOH-induced post-vaccination granulomas in sheep experimentally infected with SRLVs. Twenty-four male lambs underwent two identical vaccination protocols and were challenged with SRLVs. Granulomas were detected in vaccinated groups only and progressively decreased in size. At post-mortem examination, 91.3% of the granulomas were recovered. Fistulas were present in granulomas following the second vaccination protocol. Central necrosis was present in 58.0% of granulomas and was associated with the vaccine used. Orthokeratotic keratin was seen within granulomas in 47.1% of the lambs. Considering all granulomas studied, significantly higher expression of MR was found compared with A3Z1. Differences in MR expression were related to the type of vaccine and the time since vaccination. A3Z1 expression was upregulated in granulomas from the infected groups. Macrophage polarization may influence SRLV infection of granulomas. While SRLV infection does not influence the architecture of post-vaccination granulomas, it may modulate their immune microenvironment. Further studies are needed to elucidate the complex interactions between AlOOH-induced granulomas and SRLV infection in sheep.}

abstract = {Objective
The decision to electively repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) involves balancing the risk of rupture, peri-procedural death, and life expectancy. Random forest classifiers (RFCs) are powerful machine learning algorithms. The aim of this study was to construct and validate a random forest machine learning tool to predict two year survival following elective AAA repair.
Methods
All patients who underwent elective open or endovascular repair of AAA from 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2021 were reviewed. They were assessed using the Vascular Services Quality Improvement Program pathway involving cardiopulmonary exercise testing, contrast enhanced computerised tomography scan, and multidisciplinary assessment. Patients were followed up for at least two years. A RFC was developed using 70% of the dataset and validated using 30% to predict survival for at least two years following AAA repair.
Results
Nine hundred and twenty five patients (n = 836 men; n = 89 women) underwent elective AAA repair; 126 (13.6%) died during the first two years; 11 (1.2%) died peri-procedurally. Variable importance analysis suggested that anaerobic threshold, pre-operative haemoglobin, maximal O2 consumption, body mass index, risk category, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second – forced vital capacity ratio were the most important contributors to the model. Sensitivity and specificity of the RFC for prediction of two year survival following surgery was 96.7% (95% CI 94.4 – 99%) and 67.1% (95% CI 61 – 72%); overall accuracy: 92.6% (95% CI 88 – 95%) (positive predictive value: 0.93, negative predictive value: 0.80); 10 fold cross validation revealed area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.88.
Conclusion
RFCs based on readily available clinical data can successfully predict survival in the first two years following elective AAA repair. Such information can contribute to the risk benefit assessment when deciding to electively repair AAAs.}

abstract = {Background
In the modern era, the use of technology can substantially impact care access. Despite the extent of its influence on several chronic medical conditions related to the heart, lungs, and others, the relationship between one’s access to digital resources and oncologic conditions has been seldom investigated in select pathologies among gastrointestinal and head-neck regions. However, studies on the influence of this “digital inequity” on other cancers pertaining to nasal and paranasal sinus cancer (NPSC) have yet to be performed. This remains in stark contrast to the extent of large data approaches assessing the impact of traditional social determinants/drivers of health (SDoH), such as factors related to one’s socioeconomic status, minoritized race or ethnicity, and housing-transportation status, on prognostic and treatment outcomes.
Objective
This study aims to use the Digital Inequity Index (DII), a novel, comprehensive tool that quantifies digital resource access on an area- or community-based level, to assess the relationship between inequities in digital accessibility with NPSC disparities in prognosis and care in the United States.
Methods
Patients with NPSC from 2008 to 2017 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were assessed for significant regression trends in the long-term follow-up period and treatment receipt across NPSCs with increasing overall digital inequity, as measured by DII. DII was based on 17 census-tract level variables derived from the summarized values overlapping that same time period from the US Census/American Community Survey and Federal Communications Commission Annual Broadband Report. Variables were categorized as infrastructure-access (ie, electronic device ownership, internet provider availability, and income-broadband subscription ratio) or sociodemographic (education, income, age, and disability), ranked, and then averaged into a composite score to encompass direct and indirect factors related to digital inequity.
Results
Across 8012 adult patients with NPSC, males (n=5416, 67.6%) and White race (n=4293, 53.6%) were the most represented demographics. With increasing digital inequity, as measured by increasing total DII scores, significant decreases in the length of long-term follow-up were observed with nasopharyngeal (P<.01) and maxillary sinus cancers (P=.02), with decreases as high as 19% (35.2 to 28.5 months, nasopharynx). Electronic device and service availability inequities showcased higher-magnitude contributions to observed associated regression trends, while the income-broadband ratio contributed less. Significantly decreased odds of receiving indicated surgery (lowest odds ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95, maxillary) and radiation (lowest odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.95, ethmoid) for several NPSCs were also observed.
Conclusions
Digital inequities are associated with detrimental NPSC care and surveillance trends in the United States, even when accounting for traditional SDoH factors. These results prompt the need to include digital factors into the discussion of contextualizing SDoH-based analyses of cancer care disparities, as well as the specific factors from which prospective implementations and initiatives can invest limited public health resources to alleviate the most pertinent drivers of disparities.}

abstract = {The nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATc3) plays a significant role in various cancer-related processes, but its interactions with transcriptional modulators, particularly Promyelocytic Leukemia protein (PML), remain poorly understood. PML, a nuclear scaffold protein, is involved in tumor suppression and transcriptional regulation. This study investigates the interaction between NFATc3 and PML, focusing on the role of SUMOylation and its impact on downstream target genes. In vitro experiments, including mass spectrometry and Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), were conducted to explore this interaction. Additionally, constructs with lysine-to-arginine (K→R) mutations at key SUMOylation sites were generated to determine whether PML SUMOylation is necessary for its interaction with NFATc3. We also assessed the impact of NFATc3 SUMOylation on its binding to PML. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were employed to measure the expression of downstream genes (Lgr5 and Olfm4) under NFATc3 and PML overexpression or knockdown conditions. Pharmacological treatment with arsenic sulfide (As4S4) was used to further investigate modulation of the PML-NFATc3 axis. Our findings revealed that the NFATc3-PML interaction is independent of the SUMOylation status of PML. Additionally, mutations in NFATc3 SUMOylation sites did not affect its binding to PML. The PML-NFATc3 axis regulates Lgr5 and Olfm4 expression, and co-expression of NFATc3 and PML synergistically upregulated these genes. Arsenic sulfide treatment reduced this synergistic effect, indicating its potential as a modulator. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of NFATc3 and PML, suggesting potential therapeutic targets in cancer.}

abstract = {Background
The bending or fracture of a tibial intramedullary nail is a rare complication with a paucity of literature regarding available methods of extraction. This systematic review discusses the currently described surgical techniques for extracting deformed tibial intramedullary nails as well any potential associated challenges.
Methods
A review of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases was conducted for articles describing the extraction of deformed tibial intramedullary nails according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Appraisal tool.
Results
24 case reports were identified as describing the extraction of 27 deformed tibial intramedullary nails. The most common methods of removal were the use of hook extractors (29.6 %), standard extraction (14.8 %) and grasping of broken distal segments via forceps (11.1 %). Challenges included nails with small internal diameters, nail segment tilting during extraction, poor capture of the nail, and subsidence of the proximal segment of the nail. Factors to consider during preoperative planning include the type and material of IMN, degree and direction of IMN angulation, and access to instrumentation.
Conclusion
There are a few core methods of removing deformed intramedullary nails depending on the nature of the deformity, nail type, material, and diameter, and tools available to the surgeon. Regardless of technique, extraction of deformed tibial intramedullary nails is associated with satisfactory patient outcomes.

Learners are increasingly subjected to inaccurate visualizations generated using artificial intelligence. Coincidentally, some learning strategies purposely let learners engage with erroneous content. Instructional visualizations can be created in varying levels of perceptual richness (or realism). We conducted the present experiment to assess whether testing using erroneous examples can be a viable strategy for learning tasks depending on their perceptual richness.
Methods
The two factors of testing (with an error-spotting task vs. without) and realism (schematic vs. realistic) were assessed using two retention tests.
Results
Testing with erroneous examples was detrimental when combined with schematic visualizations, but helpful when applied to realistic imagery in one of the tests.
Conclusion
Studying with erroneous examples appears to require a certain level of realism to be an effective method. Exposing learners to inaccurate visualizations such as those generated by artificial intelligence tools may not be problematic as long as this fact is disclosed.}

Drawing upon theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, it proposes a “Creative Project Approach” that integrates generative AI and robotics in ECE. A pedagogical framework is developed, consisting of five key steps: (1) identifying learning needs, (2) facilitating child-robot interaction with teacher guidance, (3) situating AI and robot use in various learning contexts, (4) determining the appropriate level of automation and creativity, and (5) evaluating learning outcomes. The paper suggests that leveraging generative AI and robotics within the Creative Project Approach holds significant promise for fostering engagement and creativity in AI-native children.}

However, the false positive/negative detection of generative AI has been noted as a challenge. In this article, statistical experiments are conducted to test the chances of false positive and false negative detection of AI-generated text. It was found that the detected likelihoods of generative AI in articles’ abstracts is much lower than that found in paragraphs taken from the literature section of the selected articles. This means that literature parts have higher likelihoods to falsely demonstrate AI-generated text. On the other hand, when genuine texts are compared with AI-generated texts, it is observed that there is a noticeable margin of overlap between their distributions and therefore type I and type II errors fall within the realm of possibility. We show that despite these challenges, generative AI like ChatGPT continues to be a promising tool for communication and information retrieval. However, it is vital to address the concerns regarding false detection of AI generated text and ensure that these models are used in ethical and responsible conduct.}

However, unearthing MNPs with high harvesting efficiency (HE) toward diverse microalgae relies on laborious experiments so far, a robust approach therefore is urgently needed to pre-evaluate the harvesting power of MNPs. Here, we predicted HE using machine learning algorithms across 1151 data points, in which the properties of MNPs and microalgae, and conditions of magnetic flocculation were comprehensively considered. Among 8 machine learning algorithms, the optimal XGBoost model showcased the best predictive performance with a high coefficient of determination (0.932), a low mean square error (6.96 %), and a low mean absolute error (4.17 %) on the test dataset. The model was also verified by batch experiments, demonstrating its ability to estimate HE accurately. Further, the Shapley additive explanations approach was used to decipher how the model made predictions from local and global perspectives, and these interpretations may offer guidelines for both the rational design of MNPS and the selection of microalgae species in magnetic flocculation. This work highlights the introduction of machine learning models to predict the harvesting ability of diverse MNPs toward microalgae, paving the way for the utilization of microalgal biomass.}

In brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI), children with upper trunk injuries have multidirectional movement deficits, including global abduction and hand-to-neck, hand-to-abdomen, and hand-to-spine movements. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of pericoracoid tissue release and postoperative structured physiotherapy as a first-step intervention to reduce the multidirectional movement deficit in children with BPBI.
Methods
Thirty-four children with BPBI underwent pericoracoid tissue release, including coracohumeral and coracoacromial ligament release, pectoralis minor release, and coracoid process osteotomy. Patients were followed up with regular physiotherapy and a home exercise program for 1 year after surgery. Before surgery and at 3 and 12 months after surgery, upper-extremity function was measured using the modified Mallet classification and Active Movement Scale, passive shoulder and elbow joint movements were measured using goniometry, and the difference in the distance between the treatment table and the acromion was measured.
Results
There was an improvement in all movement tasks evaluated with modified Mallet classification, and there was increased shoulder flexion, abduction, and external and internal rotation movements as evaluated with Active Movement Scale. Increased passive joint movements were noted in abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation movements with the arm next to the body and with the limb in 90° abduction. There was a decrease in the distance difference between the acromion and the treatment table between both sides.
Conclusions
Pericoracoid tissue release provided multidirectional improvement in shoulder joint movements in children with BPBI.

Furthermore, the relationship between the viscosity of the slurry and the solubility parameters (SPs) of the silica particles and acrylic monomers was investigated. When the SPs of the silica particles and acrylic monomers were close, the viscosity of the silica slurry decreased and high concentrations of the silica particles could be dispersed in the acrylic monomers. Therefore, SP can be used for predicting the dispersibility of silica particles. The prepared slurry was then used to fabricate sintered silica glass. Silica slurry was cured through photopolymerization to obtain a green body, which was then heat-treated at 850 °C in air atmosphere and sintered at 1710 °C under vacuum to obtain sintered silica glass. Transparent sintered silica glass with no cracks was obtained using 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate, which has a similar SP to that of silica particles, as a solvent. The obtained sintered silica glass exhibited a transmittance of 92 % at a wavelength of 400 nm. In the ultraviolet region, light absorption originated from two-coordinated Si in the glass. The absorption spectrum in the infrared region showed an extremely low peak of the SiOH group, indicating that low-OH silica glass was obtained. Thus, this study provides a new method for fabricating silica glass and provides a method of selecting solvents for the slurries used in powder sintering.}

abstract = {Objectives
The nature of paramedic workflows, where paramedics are responsible to provide care and chart concurrently, can result in incomplete or non-existent patient care reports on patient handover to the emergency department (ED). Charting delays and retrospective recollection of care may lead to patient information gaps, which can increase ED workload, cause care delays, and increase the risk of adverse events. Speech recognition documentation technology has the potential to produce complete patient care reports quicker and improve paramedic-to-ED handover. We performed a scoping review to determine paramedic perceptions and user requirements for speech recognition documentation technology.
Methods
MEDLINE, Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, ProQuest, and CINAHL were searched from 2014 to March 2024. Criteria included studies focused on paramedics’ use or perceptions of speech recognition documentation technology. This review included studies conducted in the prehospital environment and adjacent agencies (i.e., ED, fire, police, military).
Results
The review identified eight articles that met inclusion criteria. All eight articles were small focus group-based studies in laboratory settings published on or after 2020. Five studies were conducted in the United States, two in Switzerland, and one in Japan. Of the eight studies, five recommended further live environment testing of the technology examined, and three underscored the importance of a user-centred design. The top user requirements for speech recognition adoption was hands-free use, noise reduction technology, battery life, and word accuracy. All eight studies recommended further research and development of speech recognition documentation technology in the prehospital workflow.
Conclusion
This scoping review has highlighted that while there is a growing interest in speech recognition documentation technology in the paramedicine workflow, more research is needed, especially with larger samples in a live environment. The user requirements and perceptions of speech recognition documentation technology in paramedicine must be better understood to design systems with high adoption rates.}

The study included 15,599 COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 75.1 (SD 15.9) years. Molnupiravir treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality in patients in both the presence of any organ dysfunction (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.96) and without organ dysfunction (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.56). Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with decreased mortality with respiratory failure (absolute risk difference: 9.5%, 95% CI 6.26-12.72) and without organ dysfunction (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.56). Antivirals also reduced the length of hospital stay; nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduced length of stay in respiratory failure by an average of 3.37 (95% CI 2.32-4.42) days, acute kidney injury by 7.25 (95% CI 2.97-11.52) days, and coagulopathy by 7.04 (95% CI 2.99-4.05) days. Molnupiravir reduced the length of stay in acute kidney injury by an average of 6.7 (95% CI 2.39-11.08) days and coagulopathy by 5.68 (95% CI 1.20-10.16) days.
Conclusions
Antivirals reduced mortality among hospitalized COVID patients, with the greatest reduction observed in patients without organ dysfunction. Antivirals were also effective in reducing the length of hospital stay.}

abstract = {Background
Anhedonia is a hallmark symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD), associated with impairments in various aspects of reward. VIVRE is the first study in patients with MDD receiving antidepressant therapy to include longitudinal assessment of reward behavior using the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a validated behavioral paradigm for the objective assessment of reward and effort-based decision-making in patients with MDD.
Methods
Randomized, double-blind study of vortioxetine (10 or 20 mg/day) versus desvenlafaxine (50 mg/day) in adults with MDD and partial response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy. Motivation for reward based on the proportion of hard trial choices was assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.
Results
There was no difference in the proportion of hard trial choices between the vortioxetine (n = 288) and desvenlafaxine (n = 300) treatment groups at baseline. Minimal change in parameters of reward motivation was seen over the 8-week treatment period in either group. The between-group difference in the proportion of hard trial choices at week 8 was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.97 [95 % CI: 0.82, 1.14]; P = 0.72). Similar results were obtained when controlling for reward probability, reward magnitude, trial number, and sex, or when limiting to the first 50 trials (excluding computer-selected trials).
Limitations
Exploratory analyses evaluating the utility of the EEfRT in clinical populations.
Conclusions
Experience from the VIVRE study suggests that further research is required to fully determine the clinical utility of the EEfRT for assessment of antidepressant treatment effects in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Purpose
Epilepsy in children is often associated with impaired quality of life, lower academic achievement, and reduced academic self-concept, as well as an increased risk of depression and anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the possible impact of comorbidities, such as learning disabilities (LD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), on these variables.
Methods
A total of 104 children with epilepsy (CWE) aged 8–15 years, attending mainstream schools, participated in the study. Of these, 45 were diagnosed with LD and/or ADHD. Participants completed the CHEQOL-25 questionnaire to assess quality of life (QoL), the SPAS questionnaire to evaluate academic self-concept, as well as inventories measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms. The data were analyzed to identify differences between subgroups with and without LD/ADHD using a two-sample t-test. Additionally, correlation analysis was conducted to identify other relevant variables influencing QoL, academic self-concept, and depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Results
QoL and academic self-concept were significantly poorer in CWE with LD/ADHD compared to those without comorbidities. QoL showed statistically significant associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms, and academic self-concept. While depressive symptoms levels in CWE without comorbidities align with those in the general population, CWE with LD/ADHD showed an increased association with depressive symptoms. Although anxiety symptoms were relatively strongly associated with depressive symptoms, their prevalence remains broadly comparable to that of children without epilepsy, regardless of the presence of LD/ADHD.
Conclusion
CWE with LD/ADHD and their families may benefit from focused attention, including targeted counseling and therapeutic interventions. However, specific interventional studies are recommended, based on child-specific findings.}

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle interventions (LIs) are the cornerstone for obesity management. The Mayo Clinic Diet (MCD) offers two approaches for LIs: the In-Person LI (IPLI) and the Digital Enhanced LI (DELI). The IPLI includes a 2-day in-person program with monthly follow-ups, whereas the DELI provides on-demand digital tools. The comparative efficacy of these approaches is currently unknown.
Methods
This retrospective study included two cohorts of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m2 and weight metrics at least 3 months after starting either the IPLI or DELI program. The primary endpoint was the total body weight loss percentage (TBWL%) at 6 months.
Results
The study included 133 participants in the IPLI cohort (mean age 46.3 years, 65.4 % female, BMI 36.4) and 9603 in the DELI cohort (mean age 60.1 years, 85.0 % female, BMI 33.1). The DELI group achieved superior TBWL% at 1, 3, and 6 months compared to the IPLI group (3.4 % vs. 1.5 %, 4.7 % vs. 2.4 %, 5.3 % vs. 2.9 %, respectively; p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and starting weight, the DELI group maintained a higher TBWL% (difference 2.0 %; 95 % CI [1.0, 3.0], p < 0.001) and a greater proportion of participants achieved >5 % TBWL at 6 months (OR 1.66; 95 % CI [1.08, 2.55], p < 0.023).

abstract = {Introduction
Patient Engagement Platforms, particularly chat functionalities, potentially improve communication but may also heighten workload, contributing to burnout among healthcare professionals. Natural Language Processing advancements, like ChatGPT and Med-PaLM, offer human-like responses to various questions, but concerns about their use in healthcare remain. This study evaluates whether Large Language Models can respond to patient questions as well as support staff in terms of quality and empathy.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 111 patient questions on lower limb arthroplasty, answered by support staff via an app, were selected. These questions were put into ChatGPT 3.5 to generate responses, and were collected on July 2 and 3, 2024. Two blinded healthcare professionals, an orthopaedic surgeon and an anesthetist, evaluated both the responses generated by ChatGPT and support staff, on quality, empathy, and risk of potential adverse events, selecting their preferred responses and identifying what they thought was ChatGPT’s response. A Patient Panel (n = 29) also assessed responses on empathy, preference, and source of the responses.
Results
Fifty questions were available for a comparative analysis between ChatGPT and support staff responses. No quality difference was found (p = 0.075) between ChatGPT and support staff, though ChatGPT was rated as more empathetic (p < 0.001). No difference was found between the two responses in the risk of incorrect treatment (p = 0.377). Physicians identified ChatGPT’s responses in 84–90 % of cases. The Patient Panel found ChatGPT to be more empathetic (p < 0.001) but showed no preference for ChatGPT (p = 0.086). Patients accurately identified ChatGPT’s responses in 34.5 % of cases (p = 0.005). Three ChatGPT responses showed high-risk errors.
Conclusion
This study shows ChatGPT generated high quality and empathetic responses to patient questions about lower limb arthroplasty. Further investigation is needed to optimize clinical use, but high appreciation for ChatGPT responses highlights the potential for use in clinical practice in the near future.}

In pharmacy research, LLMs have demonstrated potential utility, though challenges regarding response reproducibility, inconsistent accuracy, and information privacy persist. While LLMs can generate functional code, the usefulness of this capability for pharmacists remains underexplored. This commentary presents a practical example of how a pharmacist, drawing on digital competency, engaged with ChatGPT to create tools that support specific practice tasks, by requesting code. These include a calculator for pharmacokinetic parameters, volume and weight-based calculators, drug-drug interaction checks from a custom data table, and a hyperlink webpage tool to support multilingual translation of consumer medicines information documents. The tools were created through iterative prompting and are presented as functional prototypes, each of which passed a pilot functionality test. This commentary encourages pharmacists to enhance their digital competence to explore practice-relevant innovation through engagement with generative AI. It also highlights the value clinicians may gain through initiating such explorations as a foundation for potential collaboration with technology experts. Finally, the commentary discusses regulatory considerations related to pharmacists’ tool creation using AI, including issues on information privacy and task responsibility. Clinicians who actively leverage their digital competency to engage with AI may contribute to shaping the future of digital support tools within pharmacy practice while advancing their professional roles in the evolving landscape of healthcare technology.}

There, however, is still a lack of 3D structures of proteins that are difficult to crystallize or proteins in complex with other macromolecules. With the advent of deep learning applications such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold, it is becoming possible to obtain 3D structures of proteins from their 1D sequences while also generating models of protein-nucleic acid complexes that have been difficult to capture through traditional methods. In this project, we utilized AlphaFold3 (AF3) to create a large number of predicted complexes of two type IA topoisomerases: human topoisomerase 3 beta (hTOP3B) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I bound to a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Topoisomerases are enzymes responsible for resolving topological barriers that arise during regular cellular activity. Obtaining structures of topoisomerase complexed with a ssDNA will allow us to discover possible sequence preferences of this enzyme and obtain structures that can be used to screen potential inhibitors. Our analysis showed that AF3 can predict the structure of the enzymes, especially the N-terminal domain, with high confidence. However, predicted protein-DNA complexes, especially with longer (> 25-mer) oligos, are unreliable. The models generated with shorter (9-mer) oligos are obtained with improved confidence and the substrates are placed similarly to crystal structures, but they do not reliably replicate the sequence specificity of the DNA binding of topoisomerase observed in biochemical assays and crystal structures.}

TM has two forms: membrane type existing on the cell surface and blood type free in plasma and urine. TM functions as an anticoagulant cofactor for thrombin activation of protein C on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Due to the excellent anti-coagulant effects in modulating the coagulation and fibrinolytic system, the recombinant human soluble TM (rhsTM) has been used for the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In addition to anti-coagulation, many studies have shown that TM can also exert anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects. TM has a lectin-like domain at its N-terminus that has been shown to exhibit direct anti-inflammatory functions. At the same time, due to its special structure, thrombomodulin plays an important role in vascular-related mechanistic diseases by participating in the regulation of inflammatory pathways, complement, HMGB1, etc. In this article, changes in TM expression in the body after injury, composition of TM structural domains, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects, and related mechanisms of TM were systematically reviewed, to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the potential clinical implications of TM in treating various diseases.}

abstract = {Statement of problem
Lighting conditions are an essential factor for accurately determining tooth color. However, the ideal lighting conditions for determining tooth shade are rarely met and are difficult to quantify. While the use of a standardized daylight lamp D55 can improve accuracy, its high cost limits its use in dental offices. The use of modern operatory treatment units for tooth color determination is promising, as they now allow for the adjustment of light source settings such as color temperature and intensity. However, studies are needed to determine whether they provide accurate color determination.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of visual tooth shade determinations under the adjusted light sources of 2 different dental treatment units in comparison with a standardized daylight lamp D55.
Material and methods
Dental treatment units from 2 manufacturers KaVoLUX 540 LED (LK) and LEDview Plus (LDS) were tested. The light sources of these units were adjusted to match daylight conditions. A daylight lamp (Dialite Color 7; Eickhorst & Co. KG) was used as a control (D55). A total of 49 participants (median age of 25 years, 30 women) underwent the Ishihara screening and received standardized training calibration. A total of 2205 clinical visual tooth shade determinations were performed with the Toothguide Training Box using the Vita 3D-Master shade guide under the 3 different lighting types. Each participant had 15 color determinations made under each of the 3 light settings. Color differences were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon rank-sum, and chi-squared tests (α=.05).
Results
The type of lighting used for tooth shade determination had no significant effect on the accuracy of selected shade based on the ΔE00 metric (P=.133). Perfect matches were achieved in 50.8% of the cases under LK, 49.8% under LDS, and 53.6% under D55 light, with no significant difference among percentages (P=.315). Although there was a significant difference in time elapsed for shade determination by light type (P=.004), this difference was not clinically relevant (20.8 seconds for LK, 23.9 seconds for LDS, 21.9 seconds for D55).
Conclusions
The accuracy of color determination for both examined dental operatory lamps was found to be comparable with that of the standard D55 daylight lamp when adjusted to specific settings.}

We tested the potential of circulating galectin-1, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) levels at baseline in individuals with knee pain as biomarkers for development of radiographic knee and/or hand osteoarthritis (OA).
Design
This study comprised 212 individuals with knee pain from the Halland osteoarthritis cohort (HALLOA). Clinical characteristics and serum/plasma levels of galectin-1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha were measured at baseline, and knee and hand radiographs were obtained at a two-year follow-up. The predictive value of circulating inflammatory markers and clinical variables at baseline was assessed using multinominal logistic regression for those who developed radiographic OA in knees only (n ​= ​25), in hands only (n ​= ​40), and in both knees and hands (n ​= ​43); the group who did not develop OA (n ​= ​104) was used as reference. Correlations were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients.
Results
As expected, age was identified as a risk factor for having radiographic knee and/or hand OA at the two-year follow-up. Baseline circulating galectin-1 levels did not associate with developing radiographic knee OA but associated with developing radiographic hand OA (odds ratio (OR) for a 20% increased risk: 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.29) and both radiographic knee and hand OA (OR for a 20% increased risk: 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.30). However, baseline IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF alpha did not associate with developing radiographic knee and/or hand OA.
Conclusion
Non-age adjusted circulating galectin-1 is superior to IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha in predicting radiographic hand but not knee OA.}

abstract = {Background
Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is widely used in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) to prevent severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure. Insufficient ATG exposure may reduce its effectiveness in GVHD prophylaxis, while excessive exposure can elevate the risk of viral reactivation, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and disease relapse. Based on monitoring ATG (Thymoglobulin, Sanofi, Lyon, France) concentrations, we developed an ATG-targeted dosing strategy and conducted a prospective, single-arm study on patients undergoing unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (URD-PBSCT) to evaluate its efficacy and safety.
Methods
We enrolled 30 patients with malignant hematological diseases who underwent URD-PBSCT between January 2020 and June 2023. All patients received an ATG-targeted dosing strategy, involving a 4-day administration of ATG: 1.5 mg/kg on day −5, 2.5 mg/kg on day −4, with dose adjustments on day −3 and day −2 to achieve an optimal area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) for active ATG. Engraftment, viral infections, acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, and survival outcomes were statistically analyzed. A historical cohort of 38 patients who underwent URD-PBSCT between December 2014 and December 2020 was used for comparison. Patients in the historical cohort received a fixed total dose of 10 mg/kg ATG from day −5 to day −2.
Results
All patients in the targeted dosing cohort achieved successful neutrophil and platelet engraftment with 100% donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation and persistent CMV viremia at 180 days post-transplantation was 30.0% and 16.7%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and persistent EBV viremia at 180 days were 46.7% and 23.3%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of grades II–IV and III–IV acute GVHD at 100 days were 49.4% and 9.3%, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 10.0%, the 1-year NRM was 10.0%, the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 80.0%, and the 1-year overall survival (OS) was 86.7%. Compared with the historical cohort, the targeted dosing cohort showed significantly lower the cumulative incidences of CMV reactivation (30.0% vs. 78.9%, P < 0.001) and persistent CMV viremia (16.7% vs. 42.1%, P = 0.026) on day 180. However, no significant differences were observed in EBV reactivation (46.7% vs. 68.4%, P = 0.170) or persistent EBV viremia (23.3% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.075) on day 180. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in the cumulative incidences of grade II–IV (49.4% vs. 50.3%, P = 0.700) or grade III–IV (9.3% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.390) acute GVHD on day 100, or 1-year chronic GVHD (10.0% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.680).
Conclusions
Utilizing a targeted ATG dosing strategy in URD-PBSCT resulted in a lower incidence of CMV reactivation and viremia without increasing the risk of acute or chronic GVHD.

abstract = {Background
Neuromyths are prevalent in counseling and counselor education, potentially promoting harmful, unproven methods. This study examines the factors that predict the prevalence of neuromyths among counselors.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 415 participants, including counselors-in-training, practitioners, educators, and supervisors. The survey measured neuromyth endorsement using a 15-item questionnaire and assessed demographic characteristics, neuroscience knowledge, and the use of nine information sources. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of neuromyths.
Results
Predictors accounted for 9.0% of the variation in neuromyths (F = 4.775, p < .001). Counselors with higher educational levels endorsed fewer neuromyths compared to those with bachelor’s degrees. The use of books was associated with fewer neuromyths (β = .144, p < .01), whereas reliance on TV predicted higher neuromyth endorsement (β = -.187, p < .001).
Conclusion
Promoting accurate neuroscience knowledge through credible sources can reduce neuromyths in the counseling profession.}
