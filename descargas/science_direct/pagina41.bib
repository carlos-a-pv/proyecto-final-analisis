abstract = {Identification of intra-pulse modulation (IPM) of radar signals is a crucial part of contemporary electronic support systems and electronic intelligence reconnaissance. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods can be very effective in recognising the IPM of radar signals. In this direction, an automatic method is proposed for recognising a few IPMs of radar signals based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a hybrid model of self-attention (SA)-aided convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Firstly, time–frequency attributes of different radar signals are obtained using CWT, and thereafter CNN-SA-BiLSTM is utilised for feature extraction from the 2D scalograms formed by the time–frequency components. The CNN extracts features from the scalograms, SA enhances the discriminative power of the feature map, and BiLSTM detects radar signals based on these features. Additionally, the study addresses real-world data imbalance issues by incorporating a generative AI model, namely the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The VAE-based approach effectively mitigates challenges arising from data imbalance situations. This method is tested at varying noise levels to give a proper representation of the actual electronic warfare environment. The simulation results demonstrate that the best overall recognition accuracy of the proposed method is 98.4%, even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).}

abstract = {An efficient log logistics plan results in log procurement cost savings. In practice, log logistics presents complexities such as synchronization of different machines, sorting of logs, and compatibility requirements. To address these complexities, this research proposes a decomposition approach for optimization of log logistics considering synchronization of log loaders and heterogeneous trucks at both cut blocks and sort yards. In the first phase, the daily number of truckloads between cut blocks and sort yards for each trucking contractor is determined, while allocation of the truckloads to compatible trucks and detailed routing and scheduling decisions are addressed in the second phase. Furthermore, a simulated annealing algorithm is developed for the second phase to obtain the schedules for large-sized problems. Additionally, the parameters of the algorithm are tuned using the Taguchi method. The algorithm is then applied to a case of a large Canadian forest company in British Columbia, Canada with a 1-month planning horizon. The results show that the proposed solution approach can successfully satisfy synchronization requirements and generate detailed schedules in a reasonable time. Also, cost savings for contractors are possible by assigning overtime rather than utilizing more trucks to fulfill their transportation tasks.}

In this paper, we discuss common pitfalls in producing review articles for publication in academic journals, offering guidance to minimize rejection rates. We highlight the dual core features of systematicity (i.e. rigor and transparency) and generativity (i.e. advancing knowledge) in review papers. Thereby, we aim to help researchers deal with the abundance of guidelines and create publishable literature reviews that meaningfully contribute to their fields. Additionally, we discuss the prospects and perils of incorporating advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), in review research.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing from an analysis of editorial guidelines, desk-rejection decisions and reviewer feedback, as well as our experience as authors, reviewers and editors, we identify six common pitfalls of literature reviews. For each pitfall, we discuss typical manifestations and mitigation strategies. We also incorporate illustrative examples of literature reviews that have successfully navigated these pitfalls.
Findings
We identify and discuss six common pitfalls: (1) lack of compelling motivation, (2) weak conceptual foundation, (3) poor research design, (4) flawed research method, (5) insufficient knowledge contributions and (6) poor paper crafting – which undermine systematicity and generativity. For each of the pitfalls, we put forward mitigation strategies, which collectively help improve systematicity and generativity. Additionally, we anticipate and discuss two (emerging) pitfalls related to AI and digital technologies in review research: irresponsible and ineffective use of AI. Again, we propose mitigation strategies.
Originality/value
We offer a structured framework to help researchers overcome common challenges in literature reviews and reduce the likelihood of rejection by leading academic journals.}

The remuneration scheme plays a significant role only in the moderate/capped adoption scenario in relative terms and in a high interest rate environment. Instead, the possibility of a bank-run calibrated on the experience of the Euro area and of Greece during the debt crisis has little effect on the value of deposits even if a CBDC is introduced.}

Existing studies on UI elements grouping mainly focus on a specific single UI-related software engineering task, and their groups vary in appearance and function. In this case, we propose our semantic component groups that pack adjacent text and non-text elements with similar semantics. In contrast to those task-oriented grouping methods, our semantic component group can be adopted for multiple UI-related software tasks, such as retrieving UI perceptual groups, improving code structure for automatic UI-to-code generation, and generating accessibility data for screen readers. To recognize semantic component groups on a UI page, we propose a robust, deep learning-based vision detector, UISCGD, which extends the SOTA deformable-DETR by incorporating UI element color representation and a learned prior on group distribution. The model is trained on our UI screenshots dataset of 1988 mobile GUIs from more than 200 apps in both iOS and Android platforms. The evaluation shows that our UISCGD achieves 6.1% better than the best baseline algorithm and 5.4 % better than deformable-DETR in which it is based.}

In addition, zinc oxide (ZnO) possesses good optical properties and particularly PL emission in these materials have been exploited for their potential use as photocatalyst, light harvesting and photosensor. These PL properties enhance when graphene quantum dots (GQD) are added to ZnO. For these reasons, we investigated the PL performance of ZnO-GQD nanocomposites. In one experiment we evaluated the PL emission of solid samples ZnO and ZnO-GQD. In a second experiment, these samples were also evaluated in aqueous phase to investigate the H2O2 effect during an experiment lasting 170 minutes. Both experiments displayed six peaks and they were related to the same PL emission source. The PL emission peak around 415 nm was found to be principal source where GQD are interacting. By varying the GQD amount to low, medium, and high concentration, the effect of H2O2 acted consequently, altering the PL emission during experiment in aqueous phase. An oxygen rich environment (ORE) occurred due to H2O2 which oxides the ZnO surface. Low GQD concentration resulted affected by an ORE weakening the GQD-ZnO contact, decreasing PL emission. In high GQD concentration, H2O2 induced GQD to reach the ZnO surface, increasing the PL emission. Only medium GQD concentration prevented oxidation of ZnO and maintained the PL emission intensity constant. When H2O2 concentration increased, for the medium GQD concentration, an excess of charge by peroxides inhibited the charge transfer from GQD to ZnO. This inhibition produces a quenching of the PL emission.}

Their unparalleled capabilities, fueled by extensive training on vast datasets and intensive utilizations, underpin this transformation. However, this achievement comes at a significant cost: the immense electricity demand required for their training and inference poses an urgent and critical challenge. As the reliance on LLMs grows, ensuring a reliable and sustainable power supply becomes paramount for their uninterrupted progress and widespread adoption. This comprehensive review paper thoroughly examines the intricacies of LLMs' lifecycle, focusing on both training and inference stages. It critically assesses various parameters and approaches for accurately estimating their electricity consumption and associated carbon emissions, drawing upon representative statistical data spanning diverse LLM products and task types. By delving into the complexities, the paper uncovers the fundamental challenges in forecasting and fulfilling LLMs’ extensive electricity demand, which are intricately linked to controversies within four bottom-up tiers: soft-and-hardware, data center, power grid, and external societal factors. Crucially, this paper offers a suite of tailored solutions for each tier, aimed at not only addressing the immediate electricity demand challenge but also fostering the long-term sustainability of LLMs. The insights outlined herein endeavor to alleviate the power shortage crisis facing LLMs, paving the way for their widespread adoption while minimizing their environmental impact and contributing to a greener future.}

Emerging research suggests the brain operates as a “prediction machine,” continuously anticipating sensory, motor, and cognitive outcomes. Central to this capability is the brain's spontaneous activity—ongoing internal processes independent of external stimuli. Neuroimaging and computational studies support that this activity is integral to maintaining and refining mental models of our environment, body, and behaviors, akin to generative models in computation. During rest, spontaneous activity expands the variability of potential representations, enhancing the accuracy and adaptability of these models. When performing tasks, internal models direct brain regions to anticipate sensory and motor states, optimizing performance. This review synthesizes evidence from various species, from C. elegans to humans, highlighting three key aspects of spontaneous brain activity’s role in prediction: the similarity between spontaneous and task-related activity, the encoding of behavioral and interoceptive priors, and the high metabolic cost of this activity, underscoring prediction as a fundamental function of brains across species.}

Using PRISMA principles and protocols, this review identified and synthesized 95 relevant research articles. The findings reveal a significant imbalance in research focus. Specifically, 65% of the studies examined the application of AI in teaching, including technologies such as conversational AI and related technologies, AI-driven learning and assessment systems, immersive technologies, visual and auditory computing, and teaching and learning analytics. In contrast, only 35% of the studies explored AI's role in enhancing teacher professional development. This review highlights a gap in research addressing the development needs of teachers as they integrate AI technologies into their teaching practices. It emphasizes the need for future research to focus more on the potential of AI in teacher professional development and to investigate how AI technologies can be applied in education from both the perspectives of student learning and teacher instruction. Furthermore, research on AI in professional development should prioritize addressing technological and ethical challenges to ensure the responsible and effective integration of AI in education.}

The results show that governance did not mediate economic recovery at the global level. However, regional analysis reveals a full mediation effect in Africa and for low-income countries in 2021. Disaggregating governance by indicators in Africa reveals complete mediation for control of corruption, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and the rule of law. Achieving sustainable economic recovery requires strengthening local governance structures and encouraging international cooperation. The research motivates the establishment of international governance institutions in the spirit of United Nations-driven frameworks.

(1) In an open economy, the CBDC negative interest rate policy can enhance the central bank's macroeconomic regulatory capacity during recessions by breaking the zero lower bound constraint on deposit interest rates. This provides a novel monetary policy tool to prevent "liquidity trap". (2) CBDC negative interest rates can strengthen the effectiveness of the quantity-based and price-based monetary policies. Specifically, it not only amplifies the short-term effects of quantity-based monetary policy and the medium- and long-term effects of price-based monetary policy, but also prolongs the effective duration of quantity-based monetary policy and reduces the transmission time lag of price-based monetary policy. (3) CBDC negative interest rates can strengthen the linkage between long-term and short-term monetary policy tools, increase the sensitivity of macroeconomic sectors to foreign monetary policy shocks, and enhance the smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.}

Family health history (FHx) is an important predictor of a person’s genetic risk but is not collected by many adults in the United States.
Objective
This study aims to test and compare the usability, engagement, and report usefulness of 2 web-based methods to collect FHx.
Methods
This mixed methods study compared FHx data collection using a flow-based chatbot (KIT; the curious interactive test) and a form-based method. KIT’s design was optimized to reduce user burden. We recruited and randomized individuals from 2 crowdsourced platforms to 1 of the 2 FHx methods. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the method’s usability, the usefulness of a report summarizing their experience, user-desired chatbot enhancements, and general user experience. Engagement was studied using log data collected by the methods. We used qualitative findings from analyzing free-text comments to supplement the primary quantitative results.
Results
Participants randomized to KIT reported higher usability than those randomized to the form, with a mean System Usability Scale score of 80.2 versus 61.9 (P<.001), respectively. The engagement analysis reflected design differences in the onboarding process. KIT users spent less time entering FHx information and reported more conditions than form users (mean 5.90 vs 7.97 min; P=.04; and mean 7.8 vs 10.1 conditions; P=.04). Both KIT and form users somewhat agreed that the report was useful (Likert scale ratings of 4.08 and 4.29, respectively). Among desired enhancements, personalization was the highest-rated feature (188/205, 91.7% rated medium- to high-priority). Qualitative analyses revealed positive and negative characteristics of both KIT and the form-based method. Among respondents randomized to KIT, most indicated it was easy to use and navigate and that they could respond to and understand user prompts. Negative comments addressed KIT’s personality, conversational pace, and ability to manage errors. For KIT and form respondents, qualitative results revealed common themes, including a desire for more information about conditions and a mutual appreciation for the multiple-choice button response format. Respondents also said they wanted to report health information beyond KIT’s prompts (eg, personal health history) and for KIT to provide more personalized responses.
Conclusions
We showed that KIT provided a usable way to collect FHx. We also identified design considerations to improve chatbot-based FHx data collection: First, the final report summarizing the FHx collection experience should be enhanced to provide more value for patients. Second, the onboarding chatbot prompt may impact data quality and should be carefully considered. Finally, we highlighted several areas that could be improved by moving from a flow-based chatbot to a large language model implementation strategy.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) is an automated method that generates the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. Deploying the AIGC model in edge networks unlocks new possibilities. Unfortunately, realizing AIGC in distributed edge networks faces critical challenges, including the interdependent control decisions, the complex trade-offs between energy consumption and total variation (TV) distance, the extension of TV distance due to insufficient denoising steps, the restriction of AIGC inferencing deadlines, and the uncertainty of AIGC task arrivals. In this paper, targeting AIGC tasks, we design polynomial-time online algorithms to overcome all these challenges. Firstly, we formulate distributed AIGC as a non-linear mixed-integer program for long-term total cost optimization. Subsequently, we propose a novel algorithmic approach that generates candidate inferencing schedules, reformulates the original problem into a new schedule selection problem, and solves this new problem using an online primal–dual-based algorithm. Moreover, we rigorously prove that our approach leads to a constant competitive ratio for the long-term total cost. Through extensive evaluations using real-world data, the superior practical performance of our approach is demonstrated, reducing the total cost by more than 50% compared to various alternative methods.}

abstract = {Geosynthetic-reinforced soil (GRS) structures are considered for reducing displacement and providing economical reinforcement solutions. The risk assessment of these structures against earthquakes, based on the prediction of seismic sliding displacement, is a major challenge in this field. Multi-objective optimization is a powerful machine learning tool for selecting efficient features for high-performance forecasting. This research investigates two strategies based on swarm intelligence and genetic programming for a comprehensive evaluation. These frameworks integrate multiobjective optimization algorithms and Newmark methods for utilizing effective physics-informed features. The first strategy is virtual multi-objective (VMO) optimization by applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on minimizing one function via variations of other functions. In this approach, the error function, as a computational error object, is minimized versus the nomination of interpretable feature space as a computational cost object through the virtual Pareto front. The second strategy is actual multi-objective (AMO) optimization by exploiting nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) based on minimizing several functions simultaneously with two various approaches, including bi-objective and many-objective algorithms through actual Pareto-optimal solutions. In this approach, the computational error value, computational cost value, and computational time value are minimized at the same time. The main novelty of the first technique is low computational complexity, resulting in high speed due to definite search space dimension-based exploration and exploitation to forecast seismic sliding displacement, whereas the major achievement of the second technique is high computational accuracy due to multiobjective structure-assisted exploitation and exploitation. Through numerical validation by employing the Newmark methods, the resultant model predicts the seismic sliding displacement of these structures using two algorithms efficiently. Nevertheless, both strategies have good performance for intelligent forecasting. The actual many-objective optimization algorithm is a more effective switchable machine learning tool based on the proposed adaptable performance index for developing a smart earthquake early warning software that can precisely detect imminent natural hazards.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
Predicting future production trends and associated land use and management practices requires an understanding of past changes in productivity and of pathways of evolving system configurations. We argue that rice systems' evolution reflects a process of adaptation to changing availabilities of production resources and the adoption of technological innovations and that differs by marginality/favorability of sites. Understanding past change trends and their determinants can help avoiding undesirable future developments and guide policy decisions for a sustained supply of rice.
OBJECTIVE
We aimed to assess agronomic system change and practices, to quantify pathways of change and to identify likely drivers of but also possible risks or opportunities associated with observed patterns of agronomic system transformation in six representative lowland rice production environments in Asia.
METHODS
We implemented a diachronic analysis (years 2000 vs. 2018) of rice production practices and yield attributes in 1024 households. We documented changes between 2000 and 2018 in lowland rice-based systems in six rice-growing environments in the Philippines, Myanmar and Cambodia, differentiating marginal and favorable sites in irrigated and in rainfed environments.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
Farmers' household attributes, resource endowment, rice yields, and key constraints differed among sites. We observed relatively low annual yield in marginal (2.2–3.0 t/ ha) than favorable (3.3–8.9 t/ ha) sites depending on countries and seasons. The farmers adopted intensification related agronomic practices has increased significantly between 2000 and 2018, especially in dry season (i.e., improved seeds by 28%, mechanical tillage by 52%, direct seeding by 21%, combined harvester by 62%). The marginality of climatic and edaphic conditions, the systems' evolutionary state in 2000, and differential pressures (policy environment), opportunities (technological change) and household attributes (resource endowment) determined the observed transition pathways across study sites.
SIGNIFICANCE
The trends towards maximizing land use intensity (double or multiple cropping), converging in the emergence of high-input and highly mechanized (laborsaving) in irrigated, and diversified rotations in rainfed rice production systems may help to elucidate agricultural research needs and potentially predict the requirements for future sustainable intensification of rice-based systems. Additionally, we argue for a continued need for further mechanization of rice establishment, especially shifting from transplanting to direct seeding during dry and wet seasons, and of the rice harvest, especially during wet season under fully irrigated environments.}

abstract = {To address issues such as ground pressure manifestation, rock beam fracture, and overburden displacement caused by multi-level sublevel filling mining of gently inclined medium-thick ore bodies, this study adopts the Fankou Lead-Zinc Mine as the engineering background. Through a combination of numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, it systematically reveals the movement behavior and the mechanism of surface subsidence of the overburden under the disturbance of multi-level sublevel filling mining. Mechanical models of the stress “pressure relief arch” and “bearing arch” are established, along with a mechanical model of the filling body and roof under combined disturbance effects. The results indicate that multi-level sublevel filling mining induces nonlinear superposition effects in the stress unloading-loading cycles. The disturbance of adjacent stopes induces an alternating development pattern of “pressure relief arch” and “bearing arch”. The activation of potential slip surfaces under combined disturbance is a key controlling factor contributing to asymmetric surface settlement. The disturbance zone can be divided into three types: a direct disturbance zone influencing the settlement magnitude of the overburden; a compound disturbance zone that alters the transmission pattern of mining-induced stress and the height of the stress arch; and a potential slip zone prone to shear and tensile failure. The stope layout pattern significantly influences the transmission pattern of mining-induced stress and the disturbance range. Under the intermittent mining mode, the overburden experiences uneven deformation within a height range of less than 150 m, whereas under the continuous filling-mining mode, uneven deformation extends to a height of up to 220 m.}

The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) what are the trends in using log-based process data in computer-based assessments, (2) which process indicators have been constructed from raw log files, (3) what latent constructs have been inferred from process indicators and at what inferential levels, and (4) what are the benefits, challenges, and future recommendations for using log-based process data. By examining these questions, we conclude that the use of log-based process data in computer-based assessment shows many potentials for enhancing the assessment. Therefore, more study using log-based process data in various fields is encouraged to better understand test-takers’ underlying response processes during assessments. Additionally, there is also a considerable demand for validating process indicators and the generalizability of findings.}

The models, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, included an attention mechanism to increase model performance in proximity of the regulatory limit for nitrate. Training and testing of the models for the Startup, Production, Shutdown and Flushing operational modes were based on operational data (consisting of 22 process variables per data sample) acquired every 2–5 s over a six-month period. The significant sets of model input attributes for the different operational modes were assessed via Spearman ranking correlation, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analysis and feed forward feature selection (FFFS). Although the variability of nitrate passage, salt passage and permeate flux was significant over the four operational modes, prediction performance for the three outcomes were with R2 and Average Absolute Relative Error (AARE) of 0.78–0.95 and 2.96–6.16 %, respectively. Model updates post membrane elements replacement demonstrated similar levels of prediction accuracy. The study results suggest that there is merit in exploring the utility of multi-mode models for sensor fault detection, data imputation, and for potential use in model-predictive control.}

abstract = {Mollusks play essential ecological roles in marine and freshwater ecosystems, with their diversity reflected not only in morphological structures but also in immune strategies. Although traditionally considered to possess only innate immunity due to the absence of a typical adaptive immune system, recent studies have revealed that certain mollusks, such as oysters, exhibit “trained immunity”-an enhanced response upon secondary exposure to pathogens. This review summarizes the latest research advances on the immune systems of bivalve and gastropod mollusks, covering both humoral and cellular immunity, with a focus on systematically comparing their commonalities and differences in immune memory mechanisms. Core mechanisms include immune gene expression reprogramming, epigenetic modifications, metabolic reprogramming, and functional differentiation of immune cells. Bivalves primarily rely on complement and lectin pathways, while gastropods are characterized by the involvement of fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) and specific lectins. Transgenerational immune priming (TGIP) has been confirmed in bivalves, whereas relevant studies in gastropods remain limited. Furthermore, this review highlights the potential applications of immune memory in aquaculture disease management, such as developing immunostimulatory strategies to combat pathogens like Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1). A deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is expected to advance the development of immune-enhancing approaches.}

Our review suggests substantial variation in research objectives and the consequent selection of eye-tracking devices, experimental design, and which gaze metrics are used and interpreted. A variety of general gaze metrics and gaze measurements related to Areas of Interest (AOI) are applied to infer cyclists’ mental workload/stress levels and attention allocation respectively. The diversity of gaze metrics reported in the literature makes cross-study comparisons difficult. Areas for future research, especially potential integration with computer vision are also discussed.}

By measuring the change in entropy as networks process data effectively, patterns critical to a well-performing network can be visualized and identified. Entropy-based loss terms are developed to improve dense and convolutional model accuracy and efficiency by promoting the ideal entropy patterns. Experiments in image compression, image classification, and image segmentation on benchmark datasets demonstrate these losses guide neural networks to learn rich latent data representations in fewer dimensions, converge in fewer training epochs, and achieve higher accuracy.}

This study aimed to construct the first high-density genetic linkage map for dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus) a commercially important marine finfish in Asia, Australia, and South Africa. Using 2b-restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) sequencing for genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, in three full-sib F1 families (Family 1, n = 69 offspring; Family 2, n = 73 offspring; and Family 3, n = 70 offspring), led to the discovery and genotyping of 22,789 SNPs. Among these, 3992 quality filtered and informative SNPs were mapped to 24 linkage groups (LGs), aligning with the species' proposed haploid chromosome number. The total integrated genetic map spanned a length of 2550 cM with an average marker spacing of 0.68 cM, achieving a genome coverage of 98.61%. Male and female specific maps highlighted differential map lengths and recombination rates between the sexes, with the female map slightly longer and a lower recombination frequency than for the male. QTL analysis for growth-related traits, weight (W), standard length (sL), and Fulton's condition factor (K), identified a total of 25 QTLs of which five QTLs were found to be consistently shared across the traits. Collectively, these shared QTLs explained a substantial proportion of the phenotypic variance, accounting for between 9.30 and 19.30% of the observed variation, suggesting potential major genes for growth. These QTL regions led to the discovery of 65 potential candidate genes, including 11 genes that were specifically located within the shared QTLs. These genes were linked to essential biological processes, including metabolism, immunity, stress response, development, and vascular function. The establishment of this high-density genetic linkage map represents an important genomic resource for comprehending the genetic determinants of economically important traits in A. japonicus, with implications for advancing and optimising ongoing marker-assisted selection (MAS) initiatives in the species.}

However, greater nuance is needed in characterizing these mechanisms, and limited neuroimaging analyses, especially regarding the relationship between the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) and other linguistic tasks, have so far prevented a comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of creativity. This paper offers to fill these gaps with a closer examination of the contributions of the specific domains and the deactivations associated with creativity. We conduct a voxel-based meta-analysis of 43 neuroimaging studies involving 1118 participants. Using Seed-Based d Mapping, we investigate the spatial activity maps in the brain associated with overall creativity and with specific domains. Our findings reveal various domain-general mechanisms related to creativity, including working memory, the ability to connect distantly related concepts, the inhibition of conventional thought, interoception, internal goal orientation, mind wandering, and mental motor simulations. We also identify domain-specific mechanisms of creativity that differ by modality. Linguistic creativity requires inhibiting typical semantic associations, musical creativity involves auditory-motor integration and spontaneous expression, and visual creativity depends on inhibiting habitual visuospatial associations. Additionally, AUT is more effective at capturing novel tool manipulation and ideation rather than elaborative creative processes, which limits its scope. This meta-analysis underscores that creativity depends on multi-component neural circuits and highlights the need for future research to report deactivations, investigate neurofeedback applications, and analyze long-term and collaborative creative processes.}

Incorporating waste glass into concrete offers a sustainable solution, but predicting its effects on mechanical properties, particularly flexural (fb) and split tensile (ft) strengths, remains complex. This study utilizes machine learning (ML) algorithms (decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), support vector regression (SVR), and gaussian process (GP)) to predict fb and ft strengths based on compressive strength (fc), concrete age, and glass replacement percentage of glass-concrete composites. Thirteen experimental studies were utilized using secondary data. Results demonstrate that Pearson correlation analysis reveals strong interdependence among mechanical properties (fc-fb: 0.809-0.876, fc-ft: 0.927-0.948, fb-ft: 0.943-0.970), with negligible influence of glass type and moderate positive impact of replacement percentage. The ML algorithms each offer unique predictive strengths—most notably, XGBoost training model achieves near-perfect accuracy (with R2 equal to 0.9991). However, k-fold cross-validation revealed overfitting concerns limiting applicability to conventional concrete compositions. Non-parametric analyses reveal moderate fc-fb correlations (Spearman’s ρ=0.5879, p=0.0739) and statistically significant fc-ft relationships (ρ=0.6364, p=0.0479), while ML models achieve high predictive accuracy by exploiting multi-feature interactions beyond simple pairwise correlations. These ML models enable optimized mix designs, advancing sustainable construction through efficient waste glass utilization as a partial aggregate replacement.}

abstract = {The quadratic knapsack problem is a relevant NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, inspired, since the Seventies, by a number of real-world applications. After its formal definition in 1980, it was subject to intensive research, especially in the last two decades. No recent review on this problem appeared in the literature after a well-known survey, published in 2007 but updated to 2003. The purpose of this work is to provide a thorough overview of classical and recent results on the quadratic knapsack problem. We examine mathematical models, linearizations and reformulations. We review upper bounds, exact algorithms, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches, and provide a comparison of their computational performance.}

abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed digital marketing enhancing its effectiveness and raising new ethical and privacy concerns. This study investigates the ethical implications of AI-based digital marketing, particularly focusing on user privacy. In terms of methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify relevant variables, followed by Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) using R within the framework of homogeneity analysis of variance using alternating least squares (HOMALS). The MCA analysis identified 3 multivariate groupings, and 21 individual variables extracted from 28 studies. The MCA identified a total of 4 clusters in the eigenvalues/variances analysis, and 5 clusters in the biplot analysis. The findings emphasize the need for a balanced approach that respects user privacy and ethical use of data when developing actions using AI-based digital marketing. However, no significant relationship is evident between the study of variables such as cross-device tracking or data-driven technologies and, the ethics of AI-based digital marketing, despite these being the most profitable actions in this environment. There is no evidence of developing personalized social media content or ads linked to privacy standards. However, a strong connection between behavioral analytics, smart content and metaverse is identified, highlighting the risks of this emerging technology in this research field, as it is not linked to privacy or ethics. Among the results, the strong proximity of real-time tracking, IoT, and surveillance variables underscores the critical need to ethically understand how user behavior in real-time is being monitored, as they do not offer a strong link to privacy or ethics. Additionally, this study provides 21 future research questions that address whether these practices are being ethically implemented, following standards like “privacy-by-default” or “privacy-by-design,” and complying with privacy laws in AI-based digital marketing. To ensure these practices align with ethical standards, it is essential to adopt frameworks prioritizing data dignity, which calls for treating user data as an extension of personal identity, requiring responsible and ethical handling throughout the data collection and processing lifecycle.}

Our hypothesis is supported through numerical examples, spanning benchmark and industrial engineering problems such as supersonic nozzle shape optimization, heat transfer, and windfarm layout optimization. We compare our method to several gradient-based and gradient-free optimization approaches. While LLMs yield comparable results to state-of-the-art methods, their imaginative nature and propensity to hallucinate demand careful handling. We provide practical guidelines for obtaining reliable answers from LLMs and discuss method limitations and potential research directions.}

Interviews often fail to accurately capture customers' needs due to communication barriers, while surveys prompt only incremental changes instead of inspiring innovation. This challenge is compounded in the service industry, where feedback is intangible and more difficult to quantify. Text analysis presents a promising solution to delve into customer preferences more deeply, providing insights that can guide the development of new products and services. Our research advances the use of generative AI, specifically the GPT engine, beyond its conventional role as a chatbot.

While the field remains productive and diverse, recent trends reflect a growing emphasis on integrating emerging technologies such as learning analytics, augmented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence (AI) into collaborative learning contexts. The study uncovers a tension within CSCL between its epistemological and methodological diversity and the need for theoretical coherence. This diversity has allowed the field to adapt and innovate but raises concerns about fragmentation and the risk of losing a unified identity. For example, while scripting remains a foundational topic, debates persist on balancing instructional guidance with learner agency to foster productive collaboration. Looking ahead, the study underscores the need for CSCL to develop integrative theoretical frameworks that bridge its rich historical foundations with the challenges posed by large-scale, distributed, and technology-mediated collaboration. Addressing these challenges, such as aligning AI innovations with existing theories and ensuring cumulative knowledge-building, will be critical for the field's ability to sustain its relevance and influence in understanding collaborative learning in complex educational environments.}

In this experimental study, we examine the two anthropomorphic chatbot design elements of personification, which includes a human-like appearance, and social orientation of communication style, which means a more sensitive and extensive communication. We tested the influence of the two design elements on social presence, satisfaction, trust and empathy towards a chatbot. First, the results show a significant influence of both anthropomorphic design elements on social presence. Second, our findings illustrate that social presence influences trusting beliefs, empathy, and satisfaction. Third, social presence acts as a mediator for both anthropomorphic design elements for satisfaction with a chatbot. Our implications provide a better understanding of anthropomorphic chatbot design elements when designing chatbots for short-term interactions, and we offer actionable implications for practice that enable more effective chatbot implementations.}

Despite advancements, transforming 2D design concepts into accurate 3D models remains a complex challenge, primarily due to the non-differentiability of traditional rendering processes that hinder gradient-based optimizations. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an innovative dual-decoder architecture that effectively separates the shape and color components of 3D models. By assigning separate decoders for vertex positions and color assignment, our proposed model enables targeted optimization of each, leading to more refined and authentic 3D reconstructions. Moreover, we have overcome the non-differentiability issue, enabling gradient-based learning through the incorporation of differentiable rendering techniques. These techniques facilitate gradient-based optimization, paving the way for data-driven enhancements in the design process. Our empirical research has demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-fidelity 3D models from 2D inputs. Additionally, we have shed light on the sensitivity of hyperparameters within our framework, offering valuable insights for future model refinement and optimization. In summary, our research provides valuable insights into enhancing 3D modeling frameworks, thereby contributing to incremental progress in the field of computer-aided design and manufacturing.}

Furthermore, contestants’ types, which are observed privately after entering the competition, are frequently correlated with one another. We examine a two-stage competition that involves two players with correlated (binary) types. In the first stage, players decide simultaneously or sequentially on the probabilities they use to disclose or conceal their type, which will become their private information later on. In the second stage, each player privately observes their own type and commits to disclosing or concealing it, after which they compete in an all-pay auction. We discover that information sharing does not occur when players’ types are negatively correlated. However, when players’ types are positively correlated, information is partially shared in all equilibria examined in this study. In an asymmetric pure strategy equilibrium, one player shares his information with probability one and the other player with probability zero. In a symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium, each player shares his information with the same positive probability.}

The explanation of the decision taken is computed by applying a latent shift that, simulates a counterfactual prediction revealing the features of each modality that contribute the most to the decision and a quantitative score indicating the modality importance. We validate our approach in the context of COVID-19 pandemic using the AIforCOVID dataset, which contains multimodal data for the early identification of patients at risk of severe outcome.

However, most existing topic models ignore the contextual semantics of disaster texts, and fail to balance the robustness and the training cost. To address these issues, a neural clustering topic model is proposed in this work. The topic probability distribution of the LDA model is integrated with the distribution semantic vector generated by a lite BERT. The fused vectors are reconstructed by a nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, and re-clustered into topics by a mini-batch based k-means++ algorithm. Compared to state-of-the-art models on three sudden-onset disaster datasets, the proposed model shows an increase of 1.79 % in average topic coherence and 33.87 % in topic diversity. Meanwhile, the inference time is reduced by 84.09 % on average. The visual study of the latent process of the proposed model reflects that its ability to compact intra-cluster vector distances and sparse inter-cluster vector distances is the potential reason for its better performance. It can be considered that the application of the proposed model can help the government enhance its ability to manage negative public opinions in sudden-onset disasters.}

To address this issue, we propose the utilization of Metamorphic Testing (MT) incorporating the “symmetry” metamorphic relation pattern (MRP) to transform the training datasets for training follow-up systems. In contrast, original datasets are employed to train source systems. By comparing the occurrence of inconsistent predictions between source and follow-up systems and analysing the efficacy of this approach, we aim to shed light on its effectiveness. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is employed to explain the inconsistencies observed. The results demonstrate that the “symmetry” MRP can induce inconsistent predictions, and XAI techniques can effectively elucidate such inconsistencies. Moreover, we find that the ordering of small-sized and imbalanced datasets can contribute to inconsistencies when using the KMeans, Random Forests or Convolutional Neural Network algorithm for software defect prediction systems. To further advance this research, future studies can extend the proposed approach by incorporating additional MRPs in domains that utilize machine learning algorithms to identify and explain inconsistencies. Another promising research avenue involves investigating the relationship between data imbalance, dataset size, and MRPs to enhance the identification of inconsistencies and derive more robust MRs.}

abstract = {As one of the necessary cash crops in China and many other countries, wolfberry is parasitized by multiple pests, and its yield is highly susceptible to being affected. On the other hand, agricultural pest backgrounds are complex. When identifying them, single-modal models cannot utilize diverse data types across modalities, resulting in low identification accuracy and data utilization. Traditional unimodal identification models can no longer meet the needs of multimodal data development in agriculture. To overcome these challenges, the ITF-WPI cross-modal feature fusion model is proposed, which consists of CoTN and ODLS for parallel processing of images and text, respectively. We incorporate the Transformer structure (CoT), which focuses on contextual feature extraction, into CoTN to make full use of the rich static and dynamic linear fusion contexts between adjacent keys and improve the 4-stage network of CoTN using Pyramid Squeezed Attention (PSA) to improve the extraction of multi-scale feature structure information and effectively promote the interaction of in-depth features with multi-scale spatial information. The ODLS network constructed by introducing 1D convolutional and bidirectional LSTM stacking has been shown to have more robust text feature acquisition than other advanced convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) models from experimental results, with a 30% reduction in MACCs compared to the optimal model. The results showed that ITF-WPI performed well in accuracy, F1 score, model size, and MACCs with 97.98%, 93.19%, 52.20 MB, and 7.828 G compared to the classical state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, lightweight SOTA model and advanced Transformer neural network synthesis, respectively. The model has critical practical applications for promoting the development of cross-modal models in agriculture and research on wolfberry pest control and improving wolfberry yields.

abstract = {Predicting whether a newly submitted bug will be resolved quickly or slowly is a crucial aspect of the bug triage process, as it enables project managers to estimate software maintenance efforts and manage development workflows more effectively. This paper proposes a deep learning approach for classifying bug reports into two categories—FAST or SLOW—based on their expected fixing time. The method leverages a feature set composed of the bug description and reporter comments and adopts a transfer learning strategy using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The problem is framed as a supervised text classification task, where LLMs exploit their ability to learn rich contextual representations of language. We introduce a novel classification workflow that guides the LLM through a structured prompt, combining two design patterns: the persona pattern to contextualize the task and the input semantic pattern to organize textual information. The workflow relies on zero-shot learning to assess whether the intrinsic knowledge embedded in the LLMs is sufficient for this prediction task. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of three state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple real-world datasets sourced from Bugzilla, encompassing a diverse range of software projects. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in accurately identifying fast-resolving bugs. Among the evaluated models, LLaMA3-8B consistently delivered superior performance. Additionally, the absence of statistically significant performance variations across datasets highlights the generalizability of the approach. Notably, the LLMs maintained strong performance even on small and imbalanced datasets, underscoring their robustness and practical applicability in real-world, data-scarce scenarios.}

We consider AML compliance as a superset of know-your-customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring capabilities. We carried out this research with Danske Bank and Concordium, using internal documents and interviews that served as empirical data. We show how storing digital representations of verified IDs with a blockchain can automate tasks and reduce redundant verification in KYC onboarding. Blockchain transparency also improves identifying counterparties, determining funds sources, and creating alerts in transaction monitoring. These reduce time and labor costs for AML compliance, which may lead to smaller banks. When more banks commit to layer-1 blockchain technology, the benefits of blockchain-based AML will increase. We carried out this theory-based qualitative research and encourage ECRA readers to recognize that the emerging technology innovations we study in this article have not yet been widely adopted and implemented by financial services firms. We also include a theoretical model with study hypotheses to make the main constructs that we investigate easily understood by non-technical ECRA readers. The findings we have developed are consistent with early-stage exploration in our research context and are intended to encourage more well-developed empirical results as the passage of time permits such work to be undertaken.}

This study presents an artificial neural network (ANN) that recommends the most suitable EOR method based on historical reservoir data. Data from EOR projects worldwide were collected, pre-processed, and then used to build the ANN, which initially achieved a 69% accuracy. The neural network was optimized using the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and compared with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, with a focus on weight and hyperparameter optimization. Validation of the neural network’s prediction was done using recall, precision, and the F1 score. Weight optimization yielded an accuracy of 68% with SSA and 34% with PSO, which were insufficient results for EOR prediction. However, hyperparameter optimization was applied, resulting in an accuracy of 94% with SSA and 90% with PSO. The SSA approach demonstrated faster convergence and higher accuracy in both optimization paths, highlighting its potential for optimizing the neural network in predicting the appropriate EOR method for a given reservoir.}

However, this information originates from multiple sources (news articles, government records, and weather records among others) and may cover several topics. Furthermore, these topics may be disproportionately covered on the web. The large size and heterogenous nature of web information render manual review difficult. To address this challenge, we have developed a multi-label text classification model, FF-BERT. FF-BERT is designed to classify FF-related web paragraphs into one or more of seven categories: (1) Damage and Economic Impact (DI), (2) Fatalities, Injuries, and Rescue (FIR), (3) Hydrometeorology (HM), (4) Warning and Emergency (WE), (5) Response and Recovery (RR), (6) Public Health (PH), and (7) Mitigation (MG). To develop FF-BERT, we labeled 21,180 paragraphs from FF-related webpages and performed experiments with multiple model architectures based on the widely used language model Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT). Our final model outperforms the baseline by 11.83%, as measured by the micro-F1 score. In addition, FF-BERT significantly improves the prediction of minority labels (RR-32.1%, PH-260.4%, and MG-138.6%). We demonstrate using real world examples that FF-BERT can be used to uncover new information about flash flood events. This information can be used to enhance existing databases, such as NOAA’s Storm Events Database.}

Second, the behavioural component of this profile is shown as covering specific behavioural features describing coopetitors. Third, operationalizations for these behavioural features are offered and tested. Our research process combines desk and field research. We develop the concept of the coopetitor profile through literature analysis, as well as integrating existing measurement approaches to operationalize the identified behavioural features, and test these operationalizations via a large-scale study of 1216 Polish manufacturing companies. We present the original concept of the coopetitor profile, consisting of four components: strategic, cultural, resource-competency and behavioural. Using the lens of partner fit, we discuss the relevance of profiling coopetitors for partner selection, and coopetition establishment and management. We conceptualize and operationalize eleven behavioural features, resulting in a robust model for a five-dimensional behavioural profile covering conflict, formality, intensity of competition, investments and trust. This study contributes to the literature by examining the less-explored aspects of coopetition - coopetitor profile, behavioural approach and behavioural features. The primary methodological contribution is developing and validating a pioneering multi-item scale for measuring the multidimensional behavioural component of the profile of coopetitors.}

Digital human avatars revitalise the international dynamic marketing capabilities (IDMCs) of firms by integrating advanced technologies that transform user interactions, improve engagement and facilitate knowledge acquisition, dissemination and usage across various sectors and business units globally. This integration promotes a dynamic approach to international brands, customer relationships and marketing knowledge management capabilities, offering profound value to users and firms.
Research limitations/implications
Our first limitation is a lack of diversity in data sources. As digital human avatars are an emerging field, we had to limit our study to 14 experts in AI and 10 podcasts. While this method provides deep insights into the perspectives of those directly involved in the development and implementation of digital human avatars, it may not capture the views of end-users or consumers who interact with these avatars, which can be an avenue for further research. Our second limitation is the potential bias in the interpretation of our interview data and podcasts. This study’s approach to data analysis, where themes are derived from the data itself, carries a risk of subjective interpretation by the researchers. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the impact of digital human avatars across different organisational contexts and ecosystems, especially focusing on how these technologies are integrated and perceived in various international markets.
Practical implications
The novel framework has direct implications for innovators and marketing practitioners who aim to adopt digital human avatars in their marketing practices to enhance the effectiveness of international marketing strategies.
Social implications
The adoption of digital human avatars can alleviate loneliest elderly and vulnerable people by being a companion. The human-like characteristics can impact sense of presence and attachment.
Originality/value
The novelty of our study lies in exploring the characteristics of technologies and practical factors that maximise the successful adoption of digital human avatars. We advance and contribute to the emerging theory of avatar marketing, IDMCs and absorptive capacity by demonstrating how digital human avatars could be adopted as part of a firm’s global digital marketing strategy. We focus specifically on six dimensions: outcomes and benefits, enhancements and capabilities, applications and domains, future implications, foundational elements and challenges and considerations. This framework has direct implications for innovators and marketing practitioners who aim to adopt digital human avatars in their marketing practices to enhance the effectiveness of international marketing strategies.}

abstract = {Negative affect appears to mediate animals’ attention to competing emotional stimuli (e.g., threatening vs. non-threatening conspecific face images), similarly to anxiety-related enhanced attention to social threat reported in humans. To investigate this ‘attention bias’ (AB, i.e., the differential attention allocation to certain types of information over others) in horses, we developed a visual AB test assessing horses’ attention towards image pairs showing unfamiliar conspecifics’ facial expressions indicating, a) negative (social threat), b) more neutral (at rest), and c) positive (food anticipation) situations. We predicted that horses exhibit greater attention to negative compared to neutral or positive face images (as a normal adaptive response), and that horses in negative affective states (inferred from validated welfare indices comprising direct (health, behaviour) and indirect (housing, management) measures summarised as individual welfare scores and subscores reflecting health, social and environmental aspects) show greater AB to negative face stimuli and all images overall. Comparing AB to positive versus neutral social stimuli is rarely considered in AB studies, we therefore explored horses’ AB responses without a priori predictions. Over six trials, 44 horses from three facilities were shown stimulus pairs (negative/neutral, negative/positive, positive/neutral) presented simultaneously on two projector screens. Attention was assessed as absolute attention duration to each image, the proportion of time the negative/positive stimulus was attended to relative to the other stimulus, and overall attention (i.e., duration of head turns towards both stimuli combined). AB to stimulus type, side, effects of facility and individual characteristics (welfare and subscores, age) was analysed using linear and generalised mixed-effect models. Against our predictions, horses attended to the images within the three stimulus pairs for similar lengths of time (negative-neutral: W=1870.5, p=0.2572; negative-positive: W=2542.5, p=0.9296; positive-neutral: W=1762.5, p=0.1019). Due to Covid-19 interruptions, our sample size was lower than our estimated required number (N=113). Still, lower welfare (X21=4.71, p=0.03) and health scores (X21=4.13, p=0.04) significantly predicted shorter attention to the negative face stimuli, possibly reflecting threat avoidance previously reported in other animals. We found significant facility effects on overall attention to the stimuli (X22=77.42, p<0.001), likely due to varying yard-specific conditions (e.g., lighting, noise). This highlights that external influences on visual attention require consideration when conducting cognitive tests at different testing sites. Further methodological investigation (e.g., test cue suitability, perceptual processing of computer-generated images; test stimuli familiarity; individual differences) is needed to evaluate the potential of AB as an indicator of affective valence in horses.}

To investigate the impact of AI-augmented writing on peer reviews, we conducted a snippet-based online survey with 17 peer reviewers from top-tier HCI conferences. Our findings indicate that while AI-augmented writing improves readability, language diversity, and informativeness, it often lacks research details and reflective insights from authors. Reviewers consistently struggled to distinguish between human and AI-augmented writing but their judgements remained consistent. They noted the loss of a “human touch” and subjective expressions in AI-augmented writing. Based on our findings, we advocate for reviewer guidelines that promote impartial evaluations of submissions, regardless of any personal biases towards GenAI. The quality of the research itself should remain a priority in reviews, regardless of any preconceived notions about the tools used to create it. We emphasize that researchers must maintain their authorship and control over the writing process, even when using GenAI's assistance.}

This study presents a framework to measure the value of OSS using data collected from GitHub, the largest platform in the world with over 100 million developers. The data include over 7.6 million repositories where software is developed, stored, and managed. We collect information about contributors and development activity such as code changes and license detail. By adopting a cost estimation model from software engineering, we develop a methodology to generate estimates of investment in OSS that are consistent with the U.S. national accounting methods used for measuring software investment. We generate annual estimates of current and inflation-adjusted investment as well as the net stock of OSS for the 2009–2019 period. Our estimates show that the U.S. investment in 2019 was $37.8 billion with a current-cost net stock of $74.3 billion.}

This study examined the impact of self-directed writing development through computer- and AI-based tasks on L2 writing outcomes, growth mindfulness, and grammatical knowledge. The research was conducted in three private English institutes in Ahvaz, Iran, involving 561 intermediate-level EFL learners that were selected using a convenience sampling method. Using a quasi-experimental design, participants were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG) of 276 students, which engaged in self-directed AI-based writing tasks, and a control group (CG) of 285 students, which followed traditional writing instruction. Quantitative data were gathered through pre- and post-tests measuring writing proficiency, growth mindfulness, and grammatical accuracy. Additionally, qualitative data were collected through interviews and questionnaires administered to the EG to assess their attitudes toward AI-based learning. The results indicated that the EG significantly outperformed the CG in writing outcomes and grammatical accuracy. Moreover, the EG demonstrated greater growth in mindfulness, with participants showing increased awareness of their writing processes and enhanced self-regulation strategies. Interviews and questionnaires revealed that participants in the EG held positive attitudes toward AI-based tasks, emphasizing increased engagement, autonomy, enjoyment, motivation, personalized learning, critical thinking, self-efficacy, time management, and collaboration in their English learning development. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based tasks in fostering both linguistic competence and metacognitive skills in L2 learners. The study provides valuable insights into the role of AI technologies in promoting independent learning and calls for further exploration of AI-based interventions in writing education.}

Combined with significant statistical uncertainties in shear failure, driven by its brittle nature, this further undermines the reliability of these models. To address these limitations, this study leverages Machine Learning (ML) to develop more robust and reliable predictive tool. A rigorous feature-selection process identified eight predictors as the most influential. Subsequently, nine ML-algorithms were trained on a refined experimental dataset comprising 239 beams, with XGBoost emerging as the top performer. This model also outperformed established models likefib Bulletin-90 and ACI 2023 models. However, the limited scope of the experimental dataset constrained the model’s predictive performance especially when separately evaluated on beams strengthened with U-wraps, full wraps or side-bonded FRP configurations. Therefore, to achieve a more reliable model a synthetic dataset was generated using Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder. The XGBoost model trained with the synthetic dataset significantly improved the performance of the former model and exhibited better predictions for all strengthening configurations. Finally, to ensure the physical consistency of predictions, values obtained from the SHapley Additive exPlanations method were analysed.}

Land-based sources of plastic litter are thought to account for the majority of plastic pollution in the marine environment, with plastic bags, bottles, wrappers, food containers and cutlery among the most common items found. In the marine environment, plastic is a transboundary pollutant, with the potential to cause damage far beyond the political borders from where it originated, making the management of this global pollutant particularly complex. In this study, the risks of land-derived plastic litter (LDPL) to major groups of marine megafauna – seabirds, cetaceans, pinnipeds, elasmobranchs, turtles, sirenians, tuna and billfish – and a selection of productive and biodiverse biogenic habitats – coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass, saltmarsh and kelp beds – were analysed using a Spatial Risk Assessment approach. The approach combines metrics for vulnerability (mechanism of harm for megafauna group or habitat), hazard (plastic abundance) and exposure (distribution of group or habitat). Several potential high-risk zones (HRZs) across the North Atlantic were highlighted, including the Azores, the UK, the French and US Atlantic coasts, and the US Gulf of Mexico. Whilst much of the modelled LDPL driving risk in the UK originated from domestic sources, in other HRZs, such as the Azores archipelago and the US Gulf of Mexico, plastic originated almost exclusively from external (non-domestic) sources. LDPL from Caribbean islands - some of the largest generators of marine plastic pollution in the dataset of river plastic emissions used in the study - was noted as a significant input to HRZs across both sides of the Atlantic. These findings highlight the potential of Spatial Risk Assessment analyses to determine the location of HRZs and understand where plastic debris monitoring and management should be prioritised, enabling more efficient deployment of interventions and mitigation measures.}

This study applies the Theory of Consumption Values to examine how consumers develop satisfaction with ChatGPT's product recommendations, while also critically assessing the relevance of each value dimension in the context of AI-mediated interactions. Drawing on a randomized online experiment with U.S. participants, we investigate the relationships between customer satisfaction with ChatGPT's responses and five perceived consumption values: functional, emotional, epistemic, social, and conditional. We also investigate if trust plays a mediating role in these connections and whether they differ depending on the task type (requiring mostly human or machine skills) and product attribute (functional, experiential, hybrid). The findings indicate that, except for social value, all value dimensions are strongly linked to greater levels of satisfaction; the most significant correlation is found for functional value. Trust significantly mediates the value–satisfaction relationship, with conditional value exhibiting the most substantial indirect effect through trust. Interestingly, functional value plays a more prominent role in associating with satisfaction for experiential and hybrid products, as well as in human-skill-intensive tasks, rather than in functional products or machine-skill-oriented tasks. Conditional value consistently shows both direct and mediated associations with satisfaction across functional and hybrid products, as well as both task types. Epistemic value demonstrates both direct and mediated associations with satisfaction in functional and experiential product contexts, as well as in tasks requiring primarily machine-based skills. These findings advance theoretical understanding of value perception in GAI interactions and offer practical insights for designing context-sensitive and trust-oriented recommendation systems.}

This study scopes the domain of drone-based learning based on a collection of forty-eight articles identified via systematic searches across the Web of Science (WoS) databases. The analytical framework for coding is underpinned by the Substitution-Augmentation-Modification-Redefinition (SAMR) model. The review explored trends, domains and pedagogical activities, research approaches, learners and learning objectives, variables and aspects of interest, and most importantly, the integration levels of drones into current pedagogical practices. The findings highlight that drones are predominantly utilized in short-term, intermittent, and collaborative learning activities, particularly within STEM-related fields. Notably, the analysis reveals a prevalent use of drones to transform learning, mainly at the Modification and Redefinition levels of the SAMR framework. Regarding drone types, off-the-shelf drones are primarily used for applying-oriented learning and are evenly distributed across the Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition levels. Conversely, custom-built drones are typically utilized for creating-oriented tasks and are most often associated with the highest SAMR level, i.e., Redefinition. Building upon these findings, the present work underscores the importance of addressing the novelty effect associated with drone-based learning, exploring strategies for sustaining student engagement over time, and investigating the cognitive benefits of intermittent drone use in educational settings. The collaborative nature of drone-based activities is also emphasized, calling for more process-oriented research to understand how drones influence collaborative learning.}

abstract = {Background
Among the alternative solutions being tested to improve access to genetic services, chatbots (or conversational agents) are being increasingly used for service delivery. Despite the growing number of studies on the accessibility and feasibility of chatbot genetic service delivery, limited attention has been paid to user interactions with chatbots in a real-world health care context.
Objective
We examined users’ interaction patterns with a pretest cancer genetics education chatbot as well as the associations between users’ clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, chatbot interaction patterns, and genetic testing decisions.
Methods
We analyzed data from the experimental arm of Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services, a multisite genetic services pragmatic trial in which participants eligible for hereditary cancer genetic testing based on family history were randomized to receive a chatbot intervention or standard care. In the experimental chatbot arm, participants were offered access to core educational content delivered by the chatbot with the option to select up to 9 supplementary informational prompts and ask open-ended questions. We computed descriptive statistics for the following interaction patterns: prompt selections, open-ended questions, completion status, dropout points, and postchat decisions regarding genetic testing. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships between clinical and sociodemographic factors and chatbot interaction variables, examining how these factors affected genetic testing decisions.
Results
Of the 468 participants who initiated a chat, 391 (83.5%) completed it, with 315 (80.6%) of the completers expressing a willingness to pursue genetic testing. Of the 391 completers, 336 (85.9%) selected at least one informational prompt, 41 (10.5%) asked open-ended questions, and 3 (0.8%) opted for extra examples of risk information. Of the 77 noncompleters, 57 (74%) dropped out before accessing any informational content. Interaction patterns were not associated with clinical and sociodemographic factors except for prompt selection (varied by study site) and completion status (varied by family cancer history type). Participants who selected ≥3 prompts (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.91; P=.03) or asked open-ended questions (odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.96; P=.04) were less likely to opt for genetic testing.
Conclusions
Findings highlight the chatbot’s effectiveness in engaging users and its high acceptability, with most participants completing the chat, opting for additional information, and showing a high willingness to pursue genetic testing. Sociodemographic factors were not associated with interaction patterns, potentially indicating the chatbot’s scalability across diverse populations provided they have internet access. Future efforts should address the concerns of users with high information needs and integrate them into chatbot design to better support informed genetic decision-making.}

We posit AI as a new actor that has blurred the lines of the actors-resources-activities model. Findings show AI is now considered a new actor within B2B networks wielding dark force consequences such as algorithmic gatekeeping, which initiates dehumanization effects. In addition, AI is reliant on access to datasets which drives up resource costs. A lack of accountability of AI marketing solutions leads to opportunistic behaviours compromising actor relationships.

abstract = {The implementation of deep learning approaches based on instance segmentation data remains a challenge for customized scenarios, owing to the time-consuming nature of acquiring and annotating real-world instance segmentation data, which requires a significant investment of semi-professional user labour. Obtaining high-quality labelled data demands expertise and meticulous attention to detail. This requirement can significantly impact the overall implementation process, adding to the complexity and resource requirements of customized scenarios with diverse objects. The proposed work addresses the challenge of generating labelled data for large-scale robotic bin-picking datasets by proposing an easy-to-use automated framework designed to create customized data with accurate labels from CAD models. The framework leverages a photorealistic rendering engine integrated with physics simulation, minimizing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. Models trained using the synthetic data generated by this framework achieved an Average Precision of 86.95%, comparable to the performance of models trained on real-world datasets. Furthermore, this paper provides a comprehensive multi-metric analysis across diverse objects representing distinct industrial applications, including naval, logistics, and aerospace domains. The evaluation also includes the use of three distinct instance segmentation networks, alongside a comparative analysis of the proposed approach against two generative model techniques.}

However, consumers in many developing economies have yet to fully adopt social commerce technology. This research, therefore, aims to develop and empirically validate a conceptual model for understanding the factors influencing consumer adoption of social commerce in Bangladesh using an adapted and extended version of the Meta-UTAUT model. Analysis was undertaken to determine the appropriateness of external constructs such as trust, social support, anxiety, grievance redressal, innovativeness, and continuous participation intention. This research collected data from 402 social commerce users from Bangladesh to test and validate the proposed research model. The results suggest that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, innovativeness and trust have a direct influence on consumer attitude, whilst social influence, grievance redressal, facilitating conditions, social support, anxiety, and attitude, significantly influence usage behavior. The results also found that usage behavior is a strong predictor of continuous participation intention. This research contributes to existing knowledge by conceptualizing and validating a technology adoption model, which emphasizes the role of anxiety and grievance redressal in consumer acceptance of social commerce.}

This study introduces a novel diffusion-based model, named ArchiDiffusion, designed to revolutionize the generation of architectural floor plans from user-drawn sketches. ArchiDiffusion employs a two-stage process that ensures both creativity and practicality, setting a new standard in automated design. Embedded within the End-to-End Shear Wall Design (EESD) framework, ArchiDiffusion seamlessly integrates with existing structural design processes, including the previously developed StructDiffusion model, to streamline the traditionally complex and inefficient design workflow. Experimental results demonstrate that ArchiDiffusion significantly outperforms existing models in layout generation, reducing design time and enhancing project quality. A case study reveals that the EESD framework, powered by ArchiDiffusion, increases the design efficiency by 50 times compared to traditional workflows. Notably, ArchiDiffusion achieves a 9.6%–15.2% improvement in layout generation accuracy over traditional GAN-based models, while the EESD framework demonstrates an approximate 20% enhancement in overall building performance, as measured by energy efficiency and spatial optimization metrics. This research highlights the significant potential of ArchiDiffusion in intelligent design processes for shear wall residential buildings, offering a promising solution to the challenges faced in integrating architectural and structural design.}

abstract = {Generating granular-scale surface albedo data is extremely important for solar photovoltaic site planning and to optimise renewable energy yield of bifacial panel installations. The albedo effect brings about a significant increase in power in bifacial photovoltaic systems, compared to their mono-facial counterparts, since the spectral response of bifacial solar panels correlates with the incident solar radiation wavelength on the back of the panel, to provide additional power generation capacity. Thus, harnessing the albedo data at relatively local scales is critical towards boosting solar power generation and providing greater power density in local electricity grids. This paper develops novel modelling approaches to produce high-resolution spectral albedo imagery across the Visible and Near Infrared (VNIR) bands, using the Wavelet-Fusion super-resolution model (i.e., Wavelet-FusionSR) trained with the Learned Gamma Correction approach by applying satellite image enhancement methodology. The proposed Wavelet-FusionSR model utilises the low-resolution moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as high-resolution multi-spectral Advanced Space-borne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite images, as critical inputs and ground-truth imagery, respectively, in order to perform sensor-to-sensor deep downscaling, without employing any synthetic or low-resolution satellite imagery data pairs. To augment the proposed deep learning algorithm across the decomposed sub-images of low-resolution inputs, we integrate local and global feature representation learning to train the proposed Wavelet-FusionSR model with Cauchy loss functions. In comparison with five competing benchmark models, the proposed Wavelet-FusionSR model demonstrates performance superiority using quantitative image downscaling metrics and visual assessments of the downscaled images for the visible band of solar radiation. The proposed Wavelet-FusionSR model yielded a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.00017, Signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) of 37.80, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.999 and combined loss, MS-SSIMLoss, based on Multi Structural Similarity and Mean Absolute Error of 2.354 for the Visible Band images, and an MSE of 0.0014, PSNR of 28.43, SSIM of 0.999 and MS-SSIMLoss of 7.426 for the NIR spectral bands, demonstrating high efficacy of the proposed Wavelet-FusionSR method. The Wavelet-FusionSR method therefore attains high-resolution spectral albedo imagery outputs.}

To understand how small and medium-sized firms have utilised Gen AI-based tools to cope with the market's high level of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises, and economic slowdown, researchers have conducted an empirical study. Although Gen AI is receiving more attention, there remains a dearth of empirical studies that investigate how it influences the entrepreneurial orientation of firms and their ability to cultivate entrepreneurial resilience amidst market turbulence. Most of the literature offers anecdotal evidence. To address this research gap, the authors have grounded their theoretical model and research hypotheses in the contingent view of dynamic capability. They tested the research hypotheses using cross-sectional data from a pre-tested survey instrument, which yielded 87 useable responses from small and medium enterprises in France. The authors used variance-based structural equation modelling with the commercial WarpPLS 7.0 software to test the theoretical model. The study's findings suggest that Gen AI and EO have a significant influence on building entrepreneurial resilience as higher-order and lower-order dynamic capabilities. However, market turbulence has a negative moderating effect on the path that joins entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial resilience. The results suggest that the assumption that high market turbulence will have positive effects on dynamic capabilities and competitive advantage is not always true, and the linear assumption does not hold, which is consistent with some scholars' assumptions. The study's results offer significant contributions to the contingent view of dynamic capabilities and open new research avenues that require further investigation into the non-linear relationship of market turbulence.}

Even though much research has been conducted in this field, relatively few review studies assess how advancements in AI techniques can contribute to the sustainable advancement of MWM systems. Furthermore, there are discrepancies and a dearth of knowledge regarding the operation of AI-based techniques in MWM. To close this gap, this study conducts a thorough review of the relevant literature with an application of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses-based methods, examining 229 peer-reviewed publications to explore the role of AI in different MWM areas, such as waste characteristics forecasting, waste bin level monitoring, process parameter prediction, vehicle routing, and MWM planning. The main AI techniques and models used in MWM optimization, as well as the application areas and stated performance metrics, are all thoroughly analyzed in this review. A conceptual framework is proposed to guide research and practice to take a holistic approach to MWM, along with areas of future study that need to be explored. Researchers, policymakers, municipalities, governments, and other waste management organizations will benefit from this study to minimize costs, maximize efficiency, eliminate the need for manual labor, and change the approach to MWM.}

However, simply offloading part of DNN to the cloud introduces significant communication overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose EC5, an Edge–Cloud Collaborative Computing framework with Compressive Communication. The compression of the intermediate feature is formulated using information theory and jointly optimized with the DNN through end-to-end multi-task learning. By decomposing DNN parameters into a new space, EC5 enables efficient storage and update of models across various compression levels. An Adaptive Exit scheme is designed to retain high-confidence inputs on the edge for fast inference, reducing reliance on the cloud. Experimental comparisons with baseline methods prove that EC5 significantly conserves network bandwidth and reduces communication instances, with low latency and acceptable accuracy loss, showing flexibility across different communication scenarios.}

Yet many students experienced difficulties in comprehending complex VLA due to their limited data visualisation literacy. While conventional scaffolding approaches like data storytelling have shown effectiveness in enhancing students’ comprehension of VLA, these approaches remain difficult to scale and adapt to individual learning needs. Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, especially conversational agents, offer potential solutions by providing personalised and dynamic support to enhance students’ comprehension of VLA. This controlled lab study investigates the effectiveness of GenAI agents, particularly when integrated with scaffolding techniques, in improving students’ comprehension of VLA. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 117 higher education students to compare the effects of two types of GenAI agents: passive agents, which respond to student queries, and proactive agents, which utilise scaffolding questions, against standalone scaffolding in a VLA comprehension task. The results show that passive agents yield comparable improvements to standalone scaffolding both during and after the intervention. Notably, proactive GenAI agents significantly enhance students’ VLA comprehension compared to both passive agents and standalone scaffolding, with these benefits persisting beyond the intervention. These findings suggest that integrating GenAI agents with scaffolding can have lasting positive effects on students’ comprehension skills and support genuine learning.}

abstract = {Background
Patients are increasingly being provided with access to their electronic health records. However, in mental health care contexts, concerns have been raised due to a perception that such access would pose risks to patients, third parties, and the therapeutic relationship. These perceived risks may affect the information practices of health care professionals (HCPs) and patients, such as how they document, share, and use information in mental health care services with a patient-accessible electronic health record (PAEHR). Although there is growing research interest in PAEHRs, no study has specifically examined how they impact information practices. Understanding the impacts on information practices may help explain other outcomes of implementing PAEHRs and inform their design.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to explore the research on PAEHRs in mental health care contexts and how PAEHRs affect information practices of HCPs and patients in this context.
Methods
A scoping review was considered the most appropriate method due to the relatively recent adoption of PAEHRs in mental health care contexts and the heterogeneous nature of the evidence base. A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted for original empirical studies that described the use of PAEHRs or associated systems in mental health care contexts. One author reviewed all full texts, with 3 other authors reviewing a subset of studies. The study characteristics and findings were documented, and a thematic synthesis and textual narrative analysis were used to develop descriptive and analytical themes that addressed the research questions.
Results
A total of 66 studies were considered eligible and included in the analysis. The impact of PAEHRs on information practices in mental health care contexts included the following: (1) they may change how HCPs document patient information, including a reduction in detail and a focus on information perceived by HCPs as objective rather than subjective; (2) they may negatively impact workflows due to changes in documentation practices and limited guidance for HCPs on how to use PAEHRs; and (3) they may contribute to improved communication between HCPs and patients, including constructive disagreements regarding what is documented in the health record. The changes to HCP information practices were influenced by a concern for the therapeutic relationship and patient safety. Furthermore, PAEHRs supported new information practices for patients, such as using their PAEHR to prepare for clinical encounters.
Conclusions
We have identified several ways in which PAEHRs shape the information practices of HCPs and patients in the mental health context. These findings can inform the design of PAEHRs to promote information practices that contribute to improving the quality of mental health care. Further research is necessary to understand how changes in information practices due to the implementation of PAEHRs impact clinical outcomes and patient experiences of care.}

This Systematic Literature Review analyses the conceptual understanding of HDTs across all application domains to clarify the conceptual foundation. Our review reveals a consensus that an HDT’s twinned entity is a human individual. However, there is little agreement on the data flows between the individual and their HDT. We address this shortcoming by proposing three categories based on the level of data integration: Human Digital Models, Human Digital Shadows, and Human Digital Twins. Finally, we synthesise our findings in a domain-agnostic general definition for HDT. We highlight an edge case where the twinned entity is a human individual alongside a strongly coupled technical system, and name it augmented Human Digital Twin (aHDT). The definition and categorisation scheme provide the needed conceptual clarity for inter-disciplinary collaboration to address open challenges. Notable challenges are sensing human data, reliable data transfers and modelling, especially behavioural modelling. Additional ethical issues concerning security, privacy and consent are central to successful HDT adoption. We call for cross-disciplinary efforts to establish a standardised framework and ethical guidelines to enable future developments.}

Through the thematic analysis of 418 responses to the open-ended question, the author gained insights into the merits, flaws, and recommendations of blended English as a foreign language learning. As a result, perceived ease of use positively affected the usefulness of blended English as a foreign language learning. Perceived ease of use, teacher support, and usefulness positively impacted the social presence of blended English as a foreign language learning. Perceived teacher support, ease of use, and social presence positively influenced the perceived enjoyment of blended English as a foreign language learning.

The results indicate that Americans are more prone to be more convinced of both (73.8 %) than only environmental regulation effects (13.6 %), climate change effects (10.1 %) or none (2.5 %). Some socioeconomic, demographic, and other segmentation variables will be studied to analyse their impact on Americans' categorisation. The segmentation variables are mainly based on environmental attitudes, societal and political views, and political ideology. The implications and limitations of our results will be further discussed.}

abstract = {Background
Advancements in tomographic medical imaging have revolutionized diagnostics and treatment monitoring by offering detailed 3D visualization of internal structures. Despite the significant value of computed tomography (CT), challenges such as high radiation dosage and cost barriers limit its accessibility, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Recognizing the potential of radiographic imaging in reconstructing CT images, this scoping review aims to explore the emerging field of synthesizing 3D CT-like images from 2D radiographs by examining the current methodologies.
Methods
A scoping review was carried out following PRISMA-SR guidelines. Eligibility criteria for the articles included full-text articles published up to September 9, 2024, studying methodologies for the synthesis of 3D CT images from 2D biplanar or four-projection x-ray images. Eligible articles were sourced from PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, and arXiv.
Results
76 studies were included. The majority (50.8 %, n = 30) were published between 2010 and 2020 (38.2 %, n = 29) and from 2020 onwards (36.8 %, n = 28), with European (40.8 %, n = 31), North American (26.3 %, n = 20), and Asian (32.9 %, n = 25) institutions being primary contributors. Anatomical regions varied, with 17.1 % (n = 13) of studies not using clinical data. Further, studies focused on the chest (25 %, n = 19), spine and vertebrae (17.1 %, n = 13), coronary arteries (10.5 %, n = 8), and cranial structures (10.5 %, n = 8), among other anatomical regions. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) (19.7 %, n = 15), generative adversarial networks (21.1 %, n = 16) and statistical shape models (15.8 %, n = 12) emerged as the most applied methodologies. A limited number of studies included explored the use of conditional diffusion models, iterative reconstruction algorithms, statistical shape models, and digital tomosynthesis.
Conclusion
This scoping review summarizes current strategies and challenges in synthetic imaging generation. The development of 3D CT-like imaging from 2D radiographs could reduce radiation risk while simultaneously addressing financial and logistical obstacles that impede global access to CT imaging. Despite initial promising results, the field encounters challenges with varied methodologies and frequent lack of proper validation, requiring further research to define synthetic imaging's clinical role.}

abstract = {Large language models offer significant potential for increasing labour productivity, such as streamlining personnel selection, but raise concerns about perpetuating systemic biases embedded into their pre-training data. This study explores the potential ethnic and gender bias of ChatGPT—a chatbot producing human-like responses to language tasks—in assessing job applicants. Using the correspondence audit approach from the social sciences, I simulated a CV screening task with 34,560 vacancy–CV combinations where the chatbot had to rate fictitious applicant profiles. Comparing ChatGPT's ratings of Arab, Asian, Black American, Central African, Dutch, Eastern European, Hispanic, Turkish, and White American male and female applicants, I show that ethnic and gender identity influence the chatbot's evaluations. Ethnic discrimination is more pronounced than gender discrimination and mainly occurs in jobs with favourable labour conditions or requiring greater language proficiency. In contrast, gender bias emerges in gender-atypical roles. These findings suggest that ChatGPT's discriminatory output reflects a statistical mechanism echoing societal stereotypes. Policymakers and developers should address systemic bias in language model-driven applications to ensure equitable treatment across demographic groups. Practitioners should practice caution, given the adverse impact these tools can (re)produce, especially in selection decisions involving humans.}
