abstract = {This study introduces a new way to analyze financial sentiment by combining advanced transformer-based models with generative artificial intelligence (AI) to better understand the language and context of financial discussions. The objective is to enhance the predictive accuracy of market behavior through improved understanding of investor sentiment. The proposed sentiment analysis framework leverages six domain-specific datasets: Social Sentiment Indices (X-Scores), Fin-SoMe, SemEval-2017 Task 5, Fin-Lin, Sanders, and Taborda. These datasets, primarily sourced from social media, reflect diverse investor perspectives. Generative AI models, like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, are used to create more data, and the meaning of words is enhanced using techniques like BERT and Word2Vec. The model is trained with a cross-entropy loss function and fine-tuned using Few-shot Learning, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and ReAct strategies, ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The use of generative AI and transformer architectures makes the model stronger and better at understanding how investors feel in real financial situations. This research contributes to the field of explicable AI in finance by demonstrating the impact of domain-adapted models and generative techniques in advancing sentiment analysis. The findings offer practical value for investors and analysts seeking data-driven insights into market dynamics and decision-making processes.}

This study builds upon this developing field by exploring how 21 university students in literacy education courses multimodally composed with generative AI and their perspectives on the use of AI in the classroom. Data sources included screen capture and video observations, design interviews, pre- and post- surveys, and multimodal products. Through qualitative and multimodal analysis, four main themes emerged for understanding preservice teachers’ multimodal composing processes: (1) composing was an iterative process of prompting guided by the AI tools, (2) composers exhibited two distinct processes when designing their projects, (3) AI shaped creative possibilities, and (4) play, humor, and surprise served a key function while composing. Preservice teachers’ perspectives also revealed insights into how AI shaped engagement with content, the importance of scaffolding AI in the classroom, and how ethics were intertwined with technical function and teaching beliefs.}

However, healthcare professionals often harbor concerns about AI-related job displacement, data security, and ethical implications, creating a perceived AI threat that may impede its widespread adoption. This study integrates the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with perceived AI threat as both a direct and moderating factor, thereby examining how threat perceptions interact with established adoption drivers in the context of healthcare in Vietnam. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 573 healthcare professionals from major hospitals across Hanoi, Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed framework, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), and perceived AI threat. The results indicate that PE, EE, and SI had significant positive effects on behavioral intention, whereas FC was not a significant predictor. Perceived AI threat demonstrated a strong negative impact on adoption intentions, particularly by moderating and weakening the positive effects of PE and SI. The model explained 79.8 % of the variance in AI adoption intention, suggesting a substantial predictive power. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of addressing existential fears regarding AI in healthcare. Interventions targeting user training, transparent communication, and regulatory support may help mitigate perceived threats and harness AI's benefits.

In the context of Parathyroid Glands detection in Nuclear Medicine, physicians rely on a subtraction process involving two different images. Consequently, the subtracted image depends entirely on the two images. This methodology is manual, time-consuming, and depends entirely on medical expertise. Conditional GAI, a sub-field of GAI, generates new data based on input specifications, enabling more controlled results. However, generative models require a large amount of data and still present limitations in precisely controlling outputs over inputs. This paper presents a new model named Nuclear Medicine U-Net Siamese Network (NM-USNet) based on a combination of U-Net and Siamese networks. The U-Net takes two input images and generates one, while the Siamese network distinguishes between the generated and the reference images. The proposed methodology achieves a mean correlation of 0.956 compared to reference images, showing its potential as a reliable medical tool to assist physicians in the detection of parathyroid glands. This advancement not only improves the accuracy of diagnosis, but also represents a significant step forward in integrating GAI into medical practice. The proposed approach gives high results despite the limited data size.}

Faculty redesigned a drug information (DI) assignment to incorporate generative artificial intelligence (AI), encouraging the responsible use of AI to craft DI responses. The purpose of this study was to explore pharmacy students' perceptions of using AI tools in DI assignments and the value of AI-enabled assignments in health professions education.
Educational activity
A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted of third-year pharmacy students' narrative reflections after completing an AI-enabled team DI assignment in a Spring 2024 critical care elective. The steps to complete the DI assignment were: 1) create an AI-generated response to a DI question, 2) critique the AI output, 3) complete an individual literature search, 4) synthesize a final team DI submission, 5) reflect. Student AI use at baseline and anticipated use following the assignment were collected via a pre−/post- course survey.
Evaluation findings
Twenty-one students were enrolled in the course and submitted narrative reflections on the DI assignment. Most students stated that prior to the assignment they had never employed the use of AI for professional or academic reasons (n = 14/20; 70 %). Two themes, describing benefits and challenges, and six sub-themes were identified from the reflective statements: user benefits, awareness of AI and its capabilities, quality of the AI response, skepticism, user responsibility, and limitations of AI.
Analysis of educational activity
Through narrative reflection, students identified benefits and challenges of integrating AI into a DI assignment. While AI enhanced efficiency, students emphasized the importance of ensuring the validity and detail of the AI-generated DI question response.}

It shows how ChatGPT, a typical GAI, can affect practices, decision-making responsibility and the management disciplines through a dual discourse. The first one emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on “what is said about it” and “what it says”. In contrast to the existing literature on ChatGPT’s potential influence on organizations, this article, through its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting with these two discourses. The conclusions may be of interest to management readers in general, and of more particular interest to the accounting profession, as the conceptualization is based more broadly on examples taken from accounting, given the close link between the accounting profession and information technologies.}

abstract = {Background
The global shortage of mental health professionals, exacerbated by increasing mental health needs post COVID-19, has stimulated growing interest in leveraging large language models to address these challenges.
Objectives
This systematic review aims to evaluate the current capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models in the context of mental health applications.
Methods
A comprehensive search across 5 databases yielded 1046 references, of which 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were original research with experimental designs (eg, Turing tests, sociocognitive tasks, trials, or qualitative methods); a focus on GenAI models; and explicit measurement of sociocognitive abilities (eg, empathy and emotional awareness), mental health outcomes, and user experience (eg, perceived trust and empathy).
Results
The studies, published between 2023 and 2024, primarily evaluated models such as ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0, Bard, and Claude in tasks such as psychoeducation, diagnosis, emotional awareness, and clinical interventions. Most studies used zero-shot prompting and human evaluators to assess the AI responses, using standardized rating scales or qualitative analysis. However, these methods were often insufficient to fully capture the complexity of GenAI capabilities. The reliance on single-shot prompting techniques, limited comparisons, and task-based assessments isolated from a context may oversimplify GenAI’s abilities and overlook the nuances of human–artificial intelligence interaction, especially in clinical applications that require contextual reasoning and cultural sensitivity. The findings suggest that while GenAI models demonstrate strengths in psychoeducation and emotional awareness, their diagnostic accuracy, cultural competence, and ability to engage users emotionally remain limited. Users frequently reported concerns about trustworthiness, accuracy, and the lack of emotional engagement.
Conclusions
Future research could use more sophisticated evaluation methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting to fully uncover GenAI’s potential. Longitudinal studies and broader comparisons with human benchmarks are needed to explore the effects of GenAI-integrated mental health care.}

Design/methodology/approach
A virtual nominal group technique engaged experts (n = 14) in idea generation, refinement and consensus building across asynchronous and synchronous stages. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively.
Findings
The GenAI Academic Integrity Policy Development Blueprint for EMI Tertiary Education is not a definitive mandate but represents a roadmap of inquiry for reflective deliberation as institutions chart their own courses in this complex terrain.
Research limitations/implications
If repeated with varying expert panellists, findings may vary to a certain extent; thus, further research with a wider range of stakeholders may be necessary for additional validation.
Practical implications
While grounded within the theoretical underpinnings of the field, the tool holds practical utility for stakeholders to develop bespoke policies and critically re-examine existing frameworks.
Social implications
As texts produced by students using English as an additional language are at risk of being wrongly accused of GenAI-assisted plagiarism, owing to the limited efficacy of text classifiers such as Turnitin, the policy recommendations encapsulated in the blueprint aim to reduce potential bias and unfair treatment of students.
Originality/value
The novel blueprint represents a step towards bridging concerning gaps in policy responses worldwide and aims to spark discussion and further much-needed scholarly exploration to this end.}

Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM), the present study employs latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered approach that identifies distinct profiles of EFL learners’ engagement in GenAI-assisted writing. A one-way ANOVA is subsequently conducted to examine whether students’ attitudes toward GenAI differed across these engagement profiles. In addition, semi-structured interviews are conducted to investigate university teachers’ perceptions of how GenAI can enhance students’ writing engagement. The LPA identifies three engagement profiles as high engagement (31.9 %), medium engagement (50.8 %), and low engagement (17.3 %). However, GenAI attitude did not show a significant relationship with writing engagement. Qualitative findings indicate that teachers are aware of GenAI’s potential in improving students’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, though few have actively integrated such tools into their teaching. This study offers new insights into the relationship between writing engagement and GenAI attitudes. It provides practical implications for students, instructors, and educational institutions seeking to implement GenAI technologies in English as a foreign language (EFL) learning and teaching.}

However, GAI is likely to be a useful tool in future professional environments, including in many chemical engineering-related roles. It is, therefore, essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use GAI responsibly, ethically, and safely. This research adopts the IDEE (Identify desired outcomes, Determine level of automation, Ensure ethics, Evaluate effectiveness) framework to develop a chemical engineering lab session which is augmented by the use of LLMs. As part of the pre-lab work, Year 1 students were tasked with using ChatGPT v3.5 to derive a model which predicted the drainage profile of water from a tank. They then tested the validity of this model experimentally in a lab session and analysed the data obtained as part of the post-lab work. Pre- and post-lab surveys were conducted which revealed that students had limited prior experience with GAI but there was a general belief that it could be useful for future work. The post-lab survey showed that the vast majority of people believed that this exercise had helped them learn how to use LLMs, how to use it ethically, how to critique the output, and what some of its limitations were. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data obtained in the same surveys. This revealed eight distinct themes, one of which showed that there was a strong awareness of the need for criticising the LLM output, of the potential pitfalls associated with its use, and concerns over the quality of the output. As such, this work provides not just a case study for the integration of LLMs, and GAI more broadly, into chemical engineering curricula, but also valuable insight into student perceptions regarding the use of this nascent technology more generally.}

To address these challenges, it is critical to offer professional training and development programs to university teachers as institutional efforts to empower them with the knowledge and skills required to navigate the complex landscape of higher education. Against this background, this position paper proposes a teacher competency framework that includes three intersecting components: self-empowerment competency, professional and pedagogical competency, and empowerment competency. This framework provides a comprehensive training model that transforms university teachers from domain-specific experts to well-rounded educators, towards the ultimate goal of empowering students. Implications of the framework for education policies, teacher education, and professional development programs are discussed.}

This paper proposes a framework based on generative artificial intelligence to reconstruct the entire vessel from a fragment. The proposed framework is based on a fragment simulation mechanism and the combination of three different deep learning models that position, reconstruct, and post-process the fragment to obtain a ready-to-use reconstruction. The method is applied as a case-study to a dataset of six Italian Bronze and Early Iron Age burial contexts, including about 4000 complete vessels and over 400 actual fragments. The results are evaluated using statistical metrics and expert human evaluation, showing promising results. The proposed method is a positive application of generative artificial intelligence in archaeology and provides a solution to the use of fragments in the digital and computational analysis of ceramics. The dataset, as well as the code used and the analytical pipeline, are fully available in the supplementary materials.}

These psychosocial phenomena are especially potent in mental health care, where outcomes are closely tied to patients’ expectations, perceived provider competence, and empathy. Drawing on conceptual understanding of placebo and nocebo effects and the latest research, this Viewpoint argues that GenAI may amplify these effects, both positive and negative. Through tone, assurance, and even the rapidity of responses, GenAI-generated text—either co-written with clinicians or peers, or fully automated—could influence patient perceptions in ways that mental health clinicians may not currently fully anticipate. When embedded in clinician notes or patient-facing summaries, AI language may strengthen expectancies that underlie placebo effects, or conversely, heighten nocebo effects through subtle cues, inaccuracies, or potentially via loss of human nuance. This article explores the implications of AI-mediated clinical communication particularly in mental health care, emphasizing the importance of transparency, ethical oversight, and psychosocial awareness as these technologies evolve.}

abstract = {Background
Digital health has been taught at medical faculties for a few years. However, in general, the teaching of digital competencies in medical education and training is still underrepresented.
Objective
This study aims to analyze the objective acquisition of digital competencies through the implementation of a transdisciplinary digital health curriculum as a compulsory elective subject at a German university. The main subject areas of digital leadership and management, digital learning and didactics, digital communication, robotics, and generative artificial intelligence were developed and taught in a transdisciplinary manner over a period of 1 semester.
Methods
The participants evaluated the relevant content of the curriculum regarding the competencies already taught in advance during the study, using a Likert scale. The participants’ increase in digital competencies were examined with a pre-post test consisting of 12 questions. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student t test. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, an analysis of the acceptance of the transdisciplinary approach as well as the application of an alternative examination method (term paper instead of a test with closed and open questions) was carried out.
Results
In the first year after the introduction of the compulsory elective subject, students of human medicine (n=15), dentistry (n=3), and medical biotechnology (n=2) participated in the curriculum. In total, 13 participants were women (7 men), and 61.1% (n=11) of the participants in human medicine and dentistry were in the preclinical study stage (clinical: n=7, 38.9%). All the aforementioned learning objectives were largely absent in all study sections (preclinical: mean 4.2; clinical: mean 4.4; P=.02). The pre-post test comparison revealed a significant increase of 106% in knowledge (P<.001) among the participants.
Conclusions
The transdisciplinary teaching of a digital health curriculum, including digital teaching methods, considers perspectives and skills from different disciplines. Our new curriculum facilitates an objective increase in knowledge regarding the complex challenges of the digital transformation of our health care system. Of the 16 student term papers arising from the course, robotics and artificial intelligence attracted the most interest, accounting for 9 of the submissions.}

Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.}

Drawing upon Construal Level Theory (CLT), Goal Pursuit Theory, and Nudging Theory, we examine whether narrow (vs. broad) GenAI nudges enhance consumers' sense of empowerment by increasing goal desirability. Three mixed-method studies (one qualitative and two experimental) reveal that narrow GenAI nudges significantly heighten goal desirability, leading to greater consumer empowerment and key behavioral outcomes, including satisfaction, repurchase intentions, and advocacy (net promoter score). These findings advance theoretical perspectives on GenAI as a nudge for consumer decision-making and offer practical insights for designing AI systems that effectively guide consumer decisions within structured choice architectures.}

abstract = {Nowadays, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools or trainable agents can craft synthetic media (hereafter referred to as deepfakes) in the form of realistic texts, images, videos, and audios, incorporating events or things that never occurred in real life. These GenAI tools empower marketers and malicious actors to create deepfakes, both authorized and weaponized multimedia, which allows them to include celebrities without appearing in front of cameras or creating seductive phishing scams. Although GenAI tools can reduce the cost of content construction, they enable new risky opportunities (e.g., deepfake phishing and cyberbullying) that negatively impact netizens’ learning and (dis)trust behaviors in cyberspace. To address such risks, this study proposes a Multi-Criteria-Multi-Decision-Makers (MCMDM)-based Deepfake Risk Assessment Framework (DeepFakeR-MF) to evaluate determinant factors that impact the cyber (dis)trust behaviors of netizens in deepfakes. Moreover, DeepFakeR-MF deploys a combination of a novel optimized spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method and a game theory-based MCMDM approach to prioritize and recommend alternative strategies that can be taken by five management sectors (e.g., industrial enterprises, governmental organizations, media outlets, social non-profit, and educational institutes) to mitigate GenAI-associated risks. Then, we collect 100 experts’ judgments by analyzing their responses to our questionnaire and prioritize the importance of determinant factors considering their preferences. To validate the prioritized factors on the performance of DeepFakeR-MF, we conduct a sensitivity analysis applying Monte Carlo statistical modeling. Finally, our results confirm that DeepFakeR-MF provides effective strategic alternatives for policymakers, educators, media professionals, engineers, and netizens, hopefully reducing the socio-economic risks of deepfakes.}

The data collection included structured GenAI dialogues, periodic questionnaires, reflective assignments, and in-depth interviews. The findings revealed three interconnected dimensions of GenAI literacy development. Students internalized and recreated GenAI knowledge through practice, developed sophisticated prompt engineering skills grounded in metacognitive abilities including a critical awareness of their own values and learning goals, and evolved from viewing GenAI as a mere tool to seeing it as a context-sensitive partner requiring both exploration and caution. Notably, students learned to craft personalized GenAI workflows, critically evaluate GenAI outputs, and establish ethical boundaries that preserved their intellectual growth. This study extends the current GenAI literacy frameworks by empirically demonstrating how knowledge, skills, and attitudes coevolve through sustained engagement.

Through an IoT sensor network, the system collects critical data on environmental parameters and hive conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and hive weight, processing them locally at the edge or centrally in the cloud. The architecture incorporates a recommendation system that uses a small language model (SLM) to generate real-time alerts based on data provided by the IoT sensors. This system implements two distinct SLM models, Phi-3.5 and Tinyllama, enabling hardware performance measurement and optimizing efficiency for edge processing. To establish optimal environmental ranges, the recommendation system uses bio-inspired algorithms, such as ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and bee swarm algorithms. Additionally, LSTM neural networks are included to predict honey production and plan hive placement based on climate and weight projections, allowing for precise and personalized adjustments. This dual processing capability (edge and cloud) reduces the need for human intervention, optimizes hive inspection times, and minimizes false positives in monitoring, making it especially beneficial for large-scale beekeeping, where weekly inspection times can exceed 50 h. With this architecture, inspection time is reduced by 80%, significantly improving efficiency in hive management and promoting sustainable practices for bee conservation through intelligent agriculture.}

Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease requiring ongoing patient education and individualized management. The increasing reliance on digital tools, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI), to answer health-related questions has raised concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and comprehensibility of AI-generated information for people living with asthma.
Objective
To evaluate systematically the reliability, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and understandability of responses generated by three widely used artificial intelligence–based chatbots (ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot) to common questions formulated by people with asthma.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 15 questions regarding asthma management were formulated by patients and categorized by difficulty. Responses from ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot were evaluated by international experts for accuracy and comprehensiveness, and by patient representatives for understandability. Reliability was assessed through consistency testing across devices. We conducted a blinded evaluation.
Results
A total of 21 experts and 16 patient representatives participated in the evaluation. ChatGPT demonstrated the highest reliability (15 of 15 responses), accuracy (median score, 9.0; interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-9.0), and comprehensiveness (median score, 8.0; IQR, 8.0-9.0) compared with Bard and Copilot (P < .0001). Bard achieved superior scores in understandability (median score, 9.0; IQR, 8.0-10.0; P < .0001). Performance differences were consistent across question difficulty levels.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–driven chatbots can provide generally accurate and understandable responses to asthma-related questions. Variability in reliability and accuracy underscores the need for caution in clinical contexts. Artificial intelligence tools may complement but cannot replace professional medical advice in asthma management.}

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and its implementation in successive business management support systems is a rapidly growing area of theoretical consideration, ongoing research, discourse and application in practice. Recently, the implementation of of GenAI in customer relationship management (CRM) systems has been observed. Accordingly, the aim of this article is to identify areas where GenAI can enhance CRM systems, using Einstain GPT, Sugar CRM or Microsoft Dynamics 365 as examples. To this end, a research question was formulated: how can GenAI improve the effective use of CRM systems? Accordingly, a preliminary study based on secondary data analysis as well as software analysis was conducted to identify areas of GenAI use in CRM systems where we see an increase in the effective application of CRM. The results of the analysis showed that GenAI-powered CRM systems support the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing, sales, commerce, service and system user success. This is because they provide numerous advantages in terms of developing, expanding and strengthening customer relationships through highly advanced personalisation, closely linked to customer segmentation, which allows unique experiences to be provided to individual segments. As a result, this translates into building a company’s competitive advantage and increasing the profitability of its CRM efforts.}

However, the potential of GenAI to address the challenges in designing central nervous system (CNS) drugs that can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and engage their targets remains largely unexplored. The integration of GenAI techniques with experimental data sets and advanced evaluation metrics provides a unique opportunity to enhance CNS drug discovery. In this viewpoint, we will introduce the definition of CNS drug-like properties and data resources in CNS drug discovery, highlighting the need to train specialized GenAI models aimed at designing novel CNS drug candidates by efficiently exploring the CNS drug-like space.

This task is challenging because tailed classes suffer from severe data scarcity while requiring a comprehensive understanding of domain-specific medical information. To this end, we propose a Generative Class feature Fusion with Agent attention (GCFA) model, which leverages LLM-driven data generation and information fusion to enhance feature representations and mitigate data imbalance. Specifically, a generative head-tailed fusion strategy is proposed, which generates tailed samples by strategically fusing semantically diverse features from both head and tailed distributions. This ensures that generated samples retain tail-class identity while enriching their semantic diversity. Then, we design a prompt-based medical terminology learning method, where LLMs can mine critical, especially some low-frequency medical terms, from three public datasets to construct a medical vocabulary dictionary. This dictionary guides our Medical Agent Attention Mechanism, enabling targeted emphasis on important medical terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated datasets. Our code is available: https://github.com/WQYwqy123456/GCFA-123#.}

The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), established in 1974, historically played a crucial role in evaluating prospective student pharmacists. Research consistently linked higher PCAT scores with stronger academic performance in pharmacy programs. However, criticisms of standardized testing, such as biases against underrepresented and low-income students, prompted a shift toward test-optional policies in many institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with a declining number of applicants, accelerated this trend and led numerous pharmacy schools to adopt PCAT-optional admissions policies, ultimately resulting in the examination’s official retirement in January 2024. This paradigm shift raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of current admissions practices amidst evolving educational landscapes marked by grade inflation, reliance on remote learning, and the use of generative artificial intelligence. Concurrently, other health professions, such as medicine and dentistry, continue to use standardized tests for admissions decisions. This commentary explores the impact of discontinuing standardized tests in pharmacy school admissions, highlighting challenges faced and proposing the development of a new, unbiased standardized assessment tool to aid in identifying students equipped to meet the demands of pharmacy education and practice.}

abstract = {Background
The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming health care globally. In China, hospitals are rapidly embracing digital transformation. Senior leaders are pivotal in influencing and deciding the adoption of GenAI technologies in professional settings. However, evidence on their perceptions and attitudes and how they evolve over time is lacking.
Objective
This study aims to investigate senior Chinese hospital leaders’ perceptions relating to GenAI and their attitudes toward adopting GenAI technologies in professional settings and to document how their perspectives evolve.
Methods
A longitudinal, descriptive qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach. Senior leaders, including hospital directors/deputies and department heads/deputies, from 3 tertiary hospitals across the Hebei, Guangdong, and Sichuan provinces were purposively sampled. Data were collected through semistructured telephone interviews at two time points (baseline and 6 months later). Interview transcriptions were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method to extract themes related to knowledge acquisition, attitudinal shifts, and evolving barriers and facilitators to GenAI adoption.
Results
A total of 32 participants were interviewed in August 2024 and February 2025, including 11 (34.4%) participants from Hebei, 12 (37.5%) from Sichuan, and 9 (28.1%) from Guangdong. Their roles included 8 (25%) hospital directors/deputies and 24 (75%) department heads/deputies. The analysis of the interview transcriptions revealed three primary themes. First, participants’ understanding of GenAI improved markedly over time as they engaged with diverse information sources and gained practical experience. Second, despite widespread support for personal use, senior leaders shifted from initial reluctance to formal institutional adoption. Third, initial obstacles, such as limited technical literacy and resource constraint concerns, diminished over time, while new drivers, including peer influence and technological breakthroughs such as DeepSeek, emerged to catalyze adoption.
Conclusions
Senior Chinese hospital leaders’ perceptions and attitudes toward GenAI have evolved significantly over time. Improved knowledge through diverse information channels has enhanced their comprehension and shifted their stance from cautious personal experimentation toward formal institutional adoption. The dynamic interplay between diminishing obstacles and emerging catalysts, notably the influence of peer practices and technological breakthroughs such as DeepSeek, underscores the potential for transformative change in health care management. Targeted educational initiatives, pilot projects, and robust policy frameworks are needed to facilitate GenAI integration.}

Despite this suggestion, research providing context-related data and research findings for university librarians and educators in Ghana is inadequate. This has left many academic librarians with the difficult task of training students for the digital world on their own, with insufficient resources to provide guidance. The insufficient resources include context-relevant data to guide policy, clear research findings to support actions and evidence to convince university policy makers about the need for course reform and increased access to technology. This paper uses a correlational design in a sample of Ghanaian university students. It investigates the relationship between digital literacy, information literacy, access to and use of technology and intention to use technology. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for pairwise relationships between the variables. The relationship between information literacy and digital literacy was conceptualized as digital information literacy and backed with data from the study. Correlations between digital literacy and information literacy were supported, and a simple linear regression further showed that information literacy predicts digital literacy. A correlation between the intention to use technology and digital literacy, as well as information literacy and intention to use technology, was supported. The findings suggest that academic librarians in Africa improve information literacy training to cover digital topics. University policy makers are advised to improve access to and use of digital technology, be open to the ethical use of digital sources of information and ensure that all students receive training in digital sources of information and new approaches.}

We used the PRISMA method to select, analyze, and report the results. We screened 766 articles from four databases and identified 17 empirical studies with 1735 students for analysis. We compared the effect on student engagement between ChatGPT-based and non-ChatGPT learning. We found a medium effect size on overall student engagement in ChatGPT-based learning in the random effects model. Our analyses further suggest that ChatGPT-based learning is more effective in fostering student behavioral (medium effective size), cognitive (large effective size), and emotional engagement (medium effective size) than non-ChatGPT learning. Our findings revealed ChatGPT is an effective tool for engaging students in learning. We also suggested three roles ChatGPT plays in fostering student engagement: personalized tutoring, programming and technical assistance, and content generation and collaboration. Our systematic literature review revealed potential risks and results in student disengagement, such as over-reliance.}

Three groups of Chinese undergraduate students were recruited: a control group (CG, N = 33) and two experimental groups (EG1, N = 33; EG2, N = 33). The CG interacted with the teacher and classmates during the speaking class. In contrast, EG1 interacted with a text- and voice-based conversational GenAI chatbot called Typebot, while EG2 engaged with a conversational GenAI chatbot that featured both text and voice interaction along with human-like avatars named D-ID Agent. Quantitative analysis using multilevel modelling revealed that EG2 showed significant improvements in WTC and SPCC and a notable reduction in FLSA levels compared to CG. However, the pre- and post-speaking test results showed no significant differences in speaking performance across the groups. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews supported these findings, highlighting the immersive learning experience and emotional support provided by the human-like avatars. These results suggest that visually embodied GenAI chatbots can effectively enhance the emotional experience during the language learning.

The qualitative phase aims to identify the critical factors that influence GAI identity threat. After coding 30 semi-structured interview transcripts, we find that GAI's high intelligence and human-like abilities facilitate three kinds of affordance that influence GAI identity threat: creative affordance, analysis affordance, and communication affordance. The quantitative phase, based on IT identity threat theory, constructs a research model to examine how the three types of affordance influence GAI identity threat, as well as identifying the behavioral consequences. An examination of survey data from 405 users indicates that GAI's creative affordance, analysis affordance, and communication affordance are associated with GAI identity threat, which may lead to users’ resistance behavior. Furthermore, GAI autonomy and user self-identity moderate the relationship between GAI affordances and GAI identity threat, respectively. This study identifies users’ negative psychological mechanisms when using AI, develops IT identity threat theory in the context of GAI, and provides implications for practitioners to reduce identity threats.}

Harnessing cognitive and instructional psychology principles, load reduction instruction (LRI) offers guidance for implementing genAI in ways that accommodate differences among novice and expert learners. LRI comprises five principles aimed at productively easing the cognitive burden on learners: (1) difficulty reduction as appropriate to prior learning, (2) support and scaffolding, (3) structured practice, (4) feedback-feedforward, and (5) independent practice and problem-solving. We suggest that the future of genAI-related learning can benefit from synthesizing genAI implementation with the core principles underpinning LRI to effectively manage the cognitive burden on diverse students as they engage with genAI to learn.}

A 3 (authorship attribution: AI vs. human vs. control) x 2 (relational tone: warmth vs. competence) between-subjects factorial design with 464 participants was conducted to assess if and how incorporating a warm tone into AI-generated apologies can help overcome AI's inherent limitations associated with machine heuristics. Results show that human-authored apologies are perceived as more sincere, with warmth enhancing their positive impact. AI authorship elicited more negative emotions and reduced perceived sincerity compared to human authorship; however, relational tone was found to moderate the indirect effects of authorship on trust and forgiveness through negative emotions and perceived sincerity. These findings highlight the importance of both emotional and cognitive mechanisms in AI-mediated communication. This research advances an understanding of AI-mediated communication, identifying relational tone as a critical moderator of machine heuristic effects in crisis communication contexts. By integrating both emotional (negative affect) and cognitive (perceived sincerity) mediators into the model, this research provides a deeper understanding of how audiences evaluate and respond to AI-generated apologies in crisis contexts. Additionally, it offers a novel application of machine heuristic theory, extending its relevance to reputational management and organizational transparency.}

abstract = {Background
Trajectory modeling is a long-standing challenge in the application of computational methods to health care. In the age of big data, traditional statistical and machine learning methods do not achieve satisfactory results as they often fail to capture the complex underlying distributions of multimodal health data and long-term dependencies throughout medical histories. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have provided powerful tools to represent complex distributions and patterns with minimal underlying assumptions, with major impact in fields such as finance and environmental sciences, prompting researchers to apply these methods for disease modeling in health care.
Objective
While AI methods have proven powerful, their application in clinical practice remains limited due to their highly complex nature. The proliferation of AI algorithms also poses a significant challenge for nondevelopers to track and incorporate these advances into clinical research and application. In this paper, we introduce basic concepts in generative AI and discuss current algorithms and how they can be applied to health care for practitioners with little background in computer science.
Methods
We surveyed peer-reviewed papers on generative AI models with specific applications to time-series health data. Our search included single- and multimodal generative AI models that operated over structured and unstructured data, physiological waveforms, medical imaging, and multi-omics data. We introduce current generative AI methods, review their applications, and discuss their limitations and future directions in each data modality.
Results
We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and reviewed 155 articles on generative AI applications to time-series health care data across modalities. Furthermore, we offer a systematic framework for clinicians to easily identify suitable AI methods for their data and task at hand.
Conclusions
We reviewed and critiqued existing applications of generative AI to time-series health data with the aim of bridging the gap between computational methods and clinical application. We also identified the shortcomings of existing approaches and highlighted recent advances in generative AI that represent promising directions for health care modeling.}

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are an online source of information consulted by adolescents to gain insight into mental health and wellness behaviors. However, the accuracy and content of generative AI responses to questions related to suicide have not been systematically investigated.
Objective
This study aims to investigate general (not counseling-specific) generative AI chatbots’ responses to questions regarding suicide.
Methods
A content analysis was conducted of the responses of generative AI chatbots to questions about suicide. In phase 1 of the study, generative chatbots examined include: (1) Google Bard or Gemini; (2) Microsoft Bing or CoPilot; (3) ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI); and (4) Claude (Anthropic). In phase 2 of the study, additional generative chatbot responses were analyzed, which included Google Gemini, Claude 2 (Anthropic), xAI Grok 2, Mistral AI, and Meta AI (Meta Platforms). The two phases occurred a year apart.
Results
Findings included a linguistic analysis of the authenticity and tone within the responses using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. There was an increase in the depth and accuracy of the responses between phase 1 and phase 2 of the study. There is evidence that the responses by the generative AI chatbots were more comprehensive and responsive during phase 2 than phase 1. Specifically, the responses were found to provide more information regarding all aspects of suicide (eg, signs of suicide, lethality, resources, and ways to support those in crisis). Another difference noted in the responses between the first and second phases was the emphasis on the 988 suicide hotline number.
Conclusions
While this dynamic information may be helpful for youth in need, the importance of individuals seeking help from a trained mental health professional remains. Further, generative AI algorithms related to suicide questions should be checked periodically to ensure best practices regarding suicide prevention are being communicated.}

Teacher educators, as key facilitators of pre-service teacher learning, play a critical role in shaping the successful adoption of GenAI. Their perceptions guide curriculum redesign, define promoted practices, and shape how pre-service teachers experience educational uses of GenAI tools, potentially multiplying its impact across future classrooms. This mixed-methods study explored Danish teacher educators’ perceptions of GenAI (n = 91), focusing on its transformative potential and the knowledge pre-service teachers need to acquire. Innovative methods, including GenAI-supported thematic analysis and Natural Language Processing, were used to analyze qualitative and quantitative survey data. Findings reveal diverse perceptions, ranging from enthusiasm for fostering innovative teaching to concerns about ethics, assessment, and safeguarding basic skills. Concerning GenAI’s potential, three key themes emerged: AI literacy, AI didactics, and AI assessment. Regarding required knowledge, teacher educators emphasized multifaceted AI literacies (AI as a teaching tool, as teaching content, and as a learning tool) framed within ethical, cultural, and democratic contexts. Mediation analyses showed that GenAI use mediated the link between both intrinsic motivation and confidence, and perceptions of its potential. Importantly, teacher educators identified a pressing need for both formal professional development and informal, collaborative learning opportunities. This study extends the TPACK framework by incorporating the triadic nature of AI literacy and emphasizes the importance of preparing educators to engage critically and responsibly with GenAI in education.}

Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI’s capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban–rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a wide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban design, through prompt modification alone.}

While recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in applying GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to support personalized learning, business model simulation, and decision-making, the field remains at an early exploratory stage. Drawing on 50 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and early 2025, the study aims to map the conceptual landscape, identify key themes, and assess the current state of theoretical and empirical development. The findings reveal four major domains in GAI-enabled EE: personalized and adaptive instruction, simulation-based entrepreneurial training, ethical and psychological concerns, and ecosystem integration through intelligent systems. Although promising use cases are identified, most studies are either conceptual or limited to small-scale exploratory evidence. As such, the long-term impact of GAI on entrepreneurial competence, mindset, and outcomes remains uncertain and calls for empirical caution. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a set of research propositions and a conceptual framework that integrates micro-level instructional applications with meso-level competency development and macro-level ecosystem readiness. These are grounded in educational theories, including constructivism, experiential learning, and social cognitive theory. In addition, the review suggests methodological strategies, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and longitudinal mixed-methods designs, to test GAI's influence across cultural and institutional contexts rigorously. Furthermore, the study discusses actionable implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of ethical guidance, digital equity, and cross-contextual adaptability. It advocates for designing GAI-integrated curricula that foster not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning. By systematically synthesizing current findings while avoiding overgeneralized claims, this review contributes to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of GAI in EE and sets the foundation for future empirical exploration.}

The Longevity Games Interview Simulator provides an innovative approach to preparing students for real-world research interactions by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Claude-3.7. This paper outlines the development and demonstrates the benefits of the simulator, designed to mimic interviews with older adults to enhance students’ interviewing skills, empathy, and cultural competence. Key outcomes included preparing students for real-world interactions with interview subjects, improving their ability to identify and properly document protected health information (PHI), gaining experience in asking relevant follow-up questions, and directing conversations to achieve interview goals. The simulator used generative AI models to create realistic interview scenarios based on demographic data from Rochester, NY. Components of the simulator included a student interview-question selection and creation portion, an interview-guide worksheet, a post-simulation quiz on the materials, and a reflective exercise focusing on information gathering and ethical considerations regarding PHI. This tool was designed for the Science of Aging course’s CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience) to provide students with practical, repeatable interview practice. A small pilot study with senior nursing students indicated that the simulator improved students’ confidence, preparedness, and understanding of ethical considerations. This paper also discusses how the simulator has potential for adaptation across educational contexts and encourages educators to develop their own custom interview simulations.}

This creates a global concern, leading to a heavy demand for verification and fact-checking of information. Existing solutions aim at educating users or using artificial intelligence to fact-check and detect false documents or media. While these methods provide a measure for combating misinformation, many of these existing methods are inaccurate. Methods such as deepfake detection for videos are an uphill battle as deepfake generation keeps improving and newer methods are created to subvert deepfake detection techniques. VeracOS is introduced and presented as an operating system modification that is easily deployed, can certify files that are created, and ensures that any user can automatically check the authenticity of files across any existing application or platform. VeracOS invents a unique algorithm for certifying and verifying files. VeracOS aims to revolutionize the war against misinformation and exploitation of fake content by introducing several key features: VeracOS allows users or corporations to easily and automatically certify their media. Unlike existing solutions, VeracOS avoids intensive computations, specialized hardware, and private data sharing. VeracOS also allows any user to automatically be notified if the file they are viewing is verified to be authentic. VeracOS does not require the modification of existing applications nor does it require the sharing of private information such as what files or media are being viewed by a user. These key features provide a highly portable and easily deployed system for users of any operating system, including Internet of Things devices and mobile operating systems. Using media files such as images and videos as exemplary file types and using Android as an exemplary operating system, a VeracOS prototype was implemented to allow any user to automatically certify or verify their media files. The results show that VeracOS is easy to use and can be easily run on smartphones without the need for specialized systems, applications, or hardware.}

abstract = {Aim
This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence literacy (GAIL) on self-directed learning skills (SDL) among nursing and midwifery students. Additionally, it examines whether general attitudes toward artificial intelligence (GAAI) mediate this relationship.
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support the development of clinical decision-making and problem-solving skills in nursing and midwifery education, particularly by enhancing students’ self-directed learning abilities.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study design was used. The study was conducted in three universities in Türkiye between January and February 2025. 656 nursing and midwifery students participated, selected through cluster sampling. Data were collected using the GAIL, GAAI and SDL scales. The survey form included descriptive questions regarding participants' socio-demographic characteristics and AI usage patterns. Structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze direct and indirect relationships among variables.
Results
A significant positive effect of GAILS on GAAIS was found (β = 0.75, p < .01). GAILS also had a direct and significant effect on SDLS (β = 0.60, p < .01). However, GAAIS did not mediate the relationship between GAILS and SDLS (β = 0.02, p > .05).
Conclusions
AI literacy significantly enhances SDL in nursing and midwifery students. However, positive attitudes toward AI do not independently foster SDL, highlighting the need for structured AI education in healthcare curricula. Future studies should explore long-term AI literacy interventions to assess their impact on academic outcomes and their potential contributions to clinical reasoning and decision-making skills.}

abstract = {Optimisation of the product design and development cycle is crucial for maintaining product quality and ensuring lower production costs. It is necessary to intervene at early stages to prevent future expenses. Leveraging rapid digitalisation to achieve the desired goals and bringing in ‘smart manufacturing’ will benefit industries with large-scale productions. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance ‘design for manufacturability (DfM)’ paradigm. Integrating digital twins and generative artificial intelligence (AI), a software is proposed that not only simulates real-world environments for testing and visualisation of potential processes but also provides designs to optimise the manufacturing process, maintain cost, and enhance the product’s appeal to the target market. The proposed model uses sensors to replicate the product in a digital environment to run a simulation. Meanwhile, a generative AI model embedded in the software provides creative and effective solutions based on user requirements and market data. When incorporated into the product development cycle, this process will ensure cost efficiency and improve the time required to develop quality products, enabling quicker launches. Thus, combining these emerging technologies yields a powerful, innovative model that enhances design for manufacturability.}

However, as industrial systems grow in scale and complexity, conventional tag configuration methods face challenges in balancing precision and operational efficiency. Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions. The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offers a transformative approach. This study introduces a structured prompt optimization strategy, termed structured tag engineering prompt (STEP), to increase the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality tag files. To validate the STEP method, we assessed five mainstream LLMs on basic tag generation tasks via the CodeBERTScore and pass@k metrics. The results revealed that performance of all models has been improved, thus validating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. On the basis of these findings, a tag generation framework grounded in the STEP method was developed and validated through case studies and practical industrial scenarios. These validations confirmed the STEP method’s applicability, demonstrating its value and potential to advance prompt engineering for SCADA systems. In summary, this study contributes to the automation and intelligence of industrial control systems while providing unique insights through the application of LLMs combined with prompt engineering in addressing complex industrial tasks.}

However, the rapidly escalating use of GLP-1/dual RA medications is poised to overwhelm an already overburdened health care provider workforce and health care delivery system, stifling its potentially dramatic benefits. Relying on existing systems and resources to address the oncoming rise in GLP-1/dual RA use will be insufficient.

However, issues such as delayed response and unsatisfactory after-sales service have severely plagued the further development of CGB. Generative AI (Gen-AI), as a disruptive innovation of artificial intelligence, offers significant potential for CGB promotion due to its excellent performance. This paper endeavors to introduce Gen-AI to the CGB scenario, and a tripartite evolutionary game model is formulated to help better understand the stakeholders' behavior including the supplier, CGB platform, and group leaders. The evolutionary stable strategies of participants under different constraints are scrutinized, which assists in exploring the impact of Gen-AI empowerment on the decision strategies of the three involved parties. Besides, simulation experiments are performed to investigate the impact of different parameter changes on the game's tripartite decisions. Results indicate that the costs, profits, and potential risks associated with Gen-AI empowerment are crucial considerations for the supplier and platform. Moreover, even with Gen-AI empowerment, the platform's revenue may decline if customers reduce their purchase frequency due to passive service from the group leader. As a result, the platform is more inclined to adopt Gen-AI empowerment when the group leader provides active service.}

A scenario-based experimental design was employed, presenting participants with hypothetical situations of restaurants utilizing AI-generated and human-created social media content. MANOVA results revealed that perceived brand authenticity, image, and self-brand congruity were significantly lower in the GenAI condition compared to the human-generated content condition. Multigroup analysis further indicated that while brand authenticity and image had diminished effects on consumer behavior under the GenAI condition, self-brand congruity played a significantly stronger role in driving e-WOM and behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that AI-generated content may weaken traditional brand perception cues, prompting consumers to rely more on internal identity alignment.

abstract = {Objective
Participation in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) provides important resources to surgeons, but the ability to do so is often limited by time and data entry personnel. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) are examples of generative artificial intelligence products that may help bridge this gap. Trained on large volumes of data, the models are used for natural language processing and text generation. We evaluated the ability of LLMs to accurately populate VQI procedural databases using operative reports.
Methods
A single-center, retrospective study was performed using institutional VQI data from 2021 to 2023. The most recent procedures for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and infrainguinal lower extremity bypass (LEB) were analyzed using Versa, a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant institutional version of ChatGPT. We created an automated function to analyze operative reports and generate a shareable VQI file using two models: gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4. Application of the LLMs was accomplished with a cloud-based programming interface. The outputs of this model were compared with VQI data for accuracy. We defined a metric as “unavailable” to the LLM if it was discussed by surgeons in <20% of operative reports.
Results
A total of 150 operative notes were analyzed, including 50 CEA, 50 EVAR, and 50 LEB. These procedural VQI databases included 25, 179, and 51 metrics, respectively. For all fields, gpt-35-turbo had a median accuracy of 84.0% for CEA (interquartile range [IQR]: 80.0%-88.0%), 92.2% for EVAR (IQR: 87.2%-94.0%), and 84.3% for LEB (IQR: 80.2%-88.1%). A total of 3 of 25, 6 of 179, and 7 of 51 VQI variables were unavailable in the operative reports, respectively. Excluding metric information routinely unavailable in operative reports, the median accuracy rate was 95.5% for each CEA procedure (IQR: 90.9%-100.0%), 94.8% for EVAR (IQR: 92.2%-98.5%), and 93.2% for LEB (IQR: 90.2%-96.4%). Across procedures, gpt-4 did not meaningfully improve performance compared with gpt-35 (P = .97, .85, and .95 for CEA, EVAR, and LEB overall performance, respectively). The cost for 150 operative reports analyzed with gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4 was $0.12 and $3.39, respectively.
Conclusions
LLMs can accurately populate VQI procedural databases with both structured and unstructured data, while incurring only minor processing costs.

keywords = {generative artificial intelligence tools and applications, GenAI, service, clinical, health care, transformation, digital},
abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence tools and applications (GenAI) are being increasingly used in health care. Physicians, specialists, and other providers have started primarily using GenAI as an aid or tool to gather knowledge, provide information, train, or generate suggestive dialogue between physicians and patients or between physicians and patients’ families or friends. However, unless the use of GenAI is oriented to be helpful in clinical service encounters that can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes, the expected potential will not be achieved. As adoption continues, it is essential to validate the effectiveness of the infusion of GenAI as an intelligent technology in service encounters to understand the gap in actual clinical service use of GenAI.
Objective
This study synthesizes preliminary evidence on how GenAI assists, guides, and automates clinical service rendering and encounters in health care The review scope was limited to articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals.
Methods
We screened and selected 0.38% (161/42,459) of articles published between January 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023, identified from PubMed. We followed the protocols outlined in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to select highly relevant studies with at least 1 element on clinical use, evaluation, and validation to provide evidence of GenAI use in clinical services. The articles were classified based on their relevance to clinical service functions or activities using the descriptive and analytical information presented in the articles.
Results
Of 161 articles, 141 (87.6%) reported using GenAI to assist services through knowledge access, collation, and filtering. GenAI was used for disease detection (19/161, 11.8%), diagnosis (14/161, 8.7%), and screening processes (12/161, 7.5%) in the areas of radiology (17/161, 10.6%), cardiology (12/161, 7.5%), gastrointestinal medicine (4/161, 2.5%), and diabetes (6/161, 3.7%). The literature synthesis in this study suggests that GenAI is mainly used for diagnostic processes, improvement of diagnosis accuracy, and screening and diagnostic purposes using knowledge access. Although this solves the problem of knowledge access and may improve diagnostic accuracy, it is oriented toward higher value creation in health care.
Conclusions
GenAI informs rather than assisting or automating clinical service functions in health care. There is potential in clinical service, but it has yet to be actualized for GenAI. More clinical service–level evidence that GenAI is used to streamline some functions or provides more automated help than only information retrieval is needed. To transform health care as purported, more studies related to GenAI applications must automate and guide human-performed services and keep up with the optimism that forward-thinking health care organizations will take advantage of GenAI.}

Such feelings can be primarily affected by VI characteristics and customer characteristics, which can also affect customers’ purchase motivations. The findings contribute to the ALSC literature by examining the emotional motivations of groundedness in customers’ purchase decisions, in contrast to the existing cognitive focus.The findings also extend the groundedness theory by identifying new sources, contextualized antecedents, and dark sides of groundedness.

abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots may be useful tools for supporting shared prostate cancer (PrCA) screening decisions, but the information produced by these tools sometimes lack quality or credibility. “Prostate Cancer Info” is a custom GPT chatbot developed to provide plain-language PrCA information only from websites of key authorities on cancer and peer-reviewed literature.
Objective
The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and readability of Prostate Cancer Info’s responses to frequently asked PrCA screening questions.
Methods
A total of 23 frequently asked PrCA questions were individually input into Prostate Cancer Info. Responses were recorded in Microsoft Word and reviewed by 2 raters for their accuracy and completeness. Readability of content was determined by pasting responses into a web-based Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease Scores calculator.
Results
Responses to all questions were accurate and culturally appropriate. In total, 17 of the 23 questions (74%) had complete responses. The average readability of responses was 64.5 (SD 8.7; written at an 8th-grade level).
Conclusions
Generative AI chatbots, such as Prostate Cancer Info, are great starting places for learning about PrCA screening and preparing men to engage in shared decision-making but should not be used as independent sources of PrCA information because key information may be omitted. Men are encouraged to use these tools to complement information received from a health care provider.}

However, with the rapid evolution of consumer demands, traditional aesthetic design processes for personalized products face significant challenges. The core challenge lies in effectively integrating Generative AI, individual differences, and style-based user preference modeling into the personalized product design workflow. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates style-themed information into the generation and evaluation of personalized product aesthetics and a new dataset. In the personalized aesthetic generation phase, a predictive model is developed to infer consumer style preferences. The top-ranked styles are then used as conditional inputs to guide the generation of conceptual design solutions. In the personalized aesthetic evaluation phase, a personalized aesthetic evaluation incorporating style themes is conducted using a hybrid model that combines interaction matrix with collaborative filtering. The proposed method is empirically validated through a case study involving wristwatch design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both aesthetic design generation and aesthetic personalized evaluation. It proves especially effective in enhancing design efficiency and meeting personalized product aesthetic preferences.}

Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how GAI-IDLE fosters user stickiness among Chinese university students by focusing on the psychological needs that influence intrinsic motivation. The constructs of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, control, and flow experience are interpreted within this motivational framework to reveal how learners’ internal psychological states influence their long-term engagement with GenAI-integrated learning environments. Guided by SDT, a survey was conducted with 669 participants, and the data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) via Smart PLS 4.0. Empirical findings demonstrate that GAI-IDLE significantly promotes user stickiness through both direct and indirect pathways. Notably, control (β = 0.440, p < 0.001) and flow experience (β = 0.180, p < 0.001) emerged as strong mediators, underscoring the centrality of learner autonomy and immersive experiences in sustaining engagement. While perceived ease of use showed a moderate positive association, perceived usefulness did not exert a significant effect, suggesting that affective and experiential dimensions may be more critical than utilitarian perceptions in motivating continued use. The study highlights the need for GAI-IDLE platforms to foster intrinsic motivation and sustain meaningful engagement.}

These technological tools offer new opportunities for both the public and professionals. However, these advancements also pose risks of exacerbating health disparities. Limited research has focused on combining these health communication mediums, particularly those enabled by new technologies like GenAI, and their applications for health promotion and health disparities. Therefore, this viewpoint, adopting a conceptual approach, provides an updated overview of health communication mediums and their role in understanding health promotion and disparities in the GenAI era. Additionally, health promotion and health disparities associated with GenAI are briefly discussed through the lens of the Technology Acceptance Model 2, the uses and gratifications theory, and the knowledge gap hypothesis. This viewpoint discusses the limitations and barriers of previous internet-based communication mediums regarding real-time responses, personalized advice, and follow-up inquiries, highlighting the potential of new technology for public health promotion. It also discusses the health disparities caused by the limitations of GenAI, such as individuals’ inability to evaluate information, restricted access to services, and the lack of skill development. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for future research on how GenAI could be leveraged for public health promotion and how its challenges and barriers may exacerbate health inequities. It underscores the need for more empirical studies, as well as the importance of enhancing digital literacy and increasing access to technology for socially disadvantaged populations.}

To generate dye-free ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) images from noninvasive ultra-widefield color fundus photography (UWF-CFP) using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and to evaluate its effectiveness in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening.
Design
A cross-sectional study involving generative AI.
Participants
This study included 1263 patients with DR (2747 UWF-CFP images and 18 321 UWF-FA images) from the Second People's Hospital of Foshan.
Methods
Ultra-widefield CFP and UWF-FA image pairs were matched and used to train a pix2pixHD generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model modified with Gradient Variance Loss. The generated UWF-FA images were evaluated using quantitative similarity metrics and qualitative ophthalmologist evaluation. An external data set, DeepDRiD, was used to validate the contribution of the generated UWF-FA images to DR grading.
Main Outcome Measures
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for DR grading.
Results
The generated early-, mid-, and late-phase UWF-FA images demonstrated high authenticity, with multiscale similarity scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 and qualitative evaluation scores from 1.64 to 1.98 (1 = real UWF-FA quality). In a Turing test with 50 randomly selected images, 56% to 76% of the generated images were indistinguishable from real images. Generated UWF-FA images successfully depict details of DR lesions, such as a nonperfusion area and leakage. The incorporation of these generated UWF-FA images in DR grading significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.869 to 0.904 compared with the baseline model using UWF-CFP images alone (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
The study suggests that the GAN-based model can successfully generate realistic multiframe UWF-FA images, which could enhance DR grading without the need for IV dye injection, with the potential to improve the safety and accessibility of DR screening.

We employ advanced machine learning techniques-topic modelling and word2vec- to extract more accurate insights from unstructured data. We collect customer reviews from AI content-creation platforms from 2022 to 2024. By combining topic modelling and word2vec, we uncover valuable insights. Our analysis identifies eight key topics: Playground, Support Hub, Content Lab, Productivity, User Experience, Access, Business Assistant, and Remix. The topic of regression analysis reveals that Content Lab, User Experience, Business Assistant, and Remix are more favourable in terms of customer satisfaction scores. The word2vec analysis with negative sampling indicates that Access and Playground demonstrate better cohesion scores compared to other themes. Conversely, themes such as Content Lab, Productivity, and Business Assistant have lower cohesion scores, indicating weak clustering among words within these themes.
