abstract = {This paper introduces readers to the use of multimodal visualization reflections (MVRs) in applied linguistics research, with special attention paid to its applications for researching various topics within second language (L2) writing. MVRs are a method of data elicitation, in which participants are asked to illustrate something (either in print or digitally) as a means of visualizing a process, an idea, and/or their current knowledge state on a given topic. Participants are then typically asked to describe what their visualization represents, including all parts of their illustration. Although MVRs have been used in a handful of L2 writing studies, their full potential has yet to be realized. Thus, this paper advocates for their use in future studies. The paper opens with a review of the concept of multimodality and its place within contemporary applied linguistics scholarship. Next, discussed is the theoretical support behind leveraging MVRs. Example studies are then outlined, showcasing how MVRs have been leveraged by previous researchers when investigating different phenomena (e.g., L2 learners’ genre awareness, identities, ideologies, and issues involving language testing). The article closes with a discussion of future research directions covering how L2 writing scholars might adopt MVRs in future studies.}

abstract = {Introduction
Difficulty removing central venous ports in children is generally uncommon. We present a rare case of intraoperative difficulty with port removal that resulted in catheter breakage.
Case presentation
An 18-year-old girl presented for port removal nearly six years after placement. The catheter was stuck intraoperatively and despite increased tension, proximal dissection, and extraction attempts with a wire, a portion of the catheter broke off intravascularly. Since intraoperative fluoroscopy confirmed that neither end of the catheter had free intravascular motion, the catheter was left in place. The patient has had no apparent complications from this retained portion of the catheter.
Conclusion
It is uncommon to have great difficulty removing a port in a child but in cases where the catheter is stuck, multiple techniques can be attempted intraoperatively to improve chances of removal. If the catheter breaks intraoperatively but has no free intravascular motion on fluoroscopy, it may be reasonable to leave the retained fragment in place and obtain interval imaging to ensure the fragment has not moved.}

abstract = {Introduction
Gastrostomy tube hypertrophic granulation tissue development, prolapse, and leakage are common problems that are often treated with tube re-siting. Wedge gastrostomy tube site resection is a revision technique used to enable continued use of the original tube site while removing affected tissue. The aim of this study was to describe this technique and outcomes in a series of patients requiring this intervention. The wedge gastrostomy tube site resection involves wedge excision of hypergranulation tissue or prolapsed gastric tissue and primary closure of the remaining defect. We reviewed outcomes for two children who underwent wedge gastrostomy tube site resection for medically refractory hypergranulation tissue.
Case presentation
Two patients presented with hypertrophic granulation tissue at their gastrostomy tube sites. In Case 1, the patient underwent two revisions spaced two years apart and has been symptom-free for 9 months. In Case 2, the patient required a single revision and has been symptom-free for 13 months. Neither patient had complications related to their gastrostomy tube site revision in the immediate postoperative period.
Conclusion
Wedge gastrostomy tube site resection is a useful strategy to remove reactive tissue that contributes to leakage around a gastrostomy tube and avoids the morbidities of tube re-siting.

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in natural language tasks and are increasingly being integrated into health care for tasks like disease risk assessment. Traditional machine learning methods rely on structured data and coding, limiting their flexibility in dynamic clinical environments. This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.
Objective
This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.
Methods
We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.
Results
Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.
Conclusions
Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.}

abstract = {Introduction
We are currently developing a cell classification system intended for routine histopathology. During observation, cells of interest are added to a deep learning (DL) network, which after training classifies the remaining cells of interest with high and immediately validatable accuracy. In this study, we identify the optimal histological microsection thickness for this process and describe in high detail the morphological differences introduced by variation in microsection thickness.
Method
From HE-stained digitized sections of liver cut manually at 5 thicknesses and on an automated microtome (DS), hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were manually annotated and loaded into a DL convolutional neural network (ResNet). The network was trained at different settings to identify the thickness with optimal relation between number of training cells and validation accuracy. To shed interpretable light on the impact of thickness, exhaustive morphological details of the annotated cells were quantified and the differences between hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes were analyzed with random forest.
Results
Classifying hepatocytes from DS sections clearly resulted in highest validation accuracy with least number of cells and for the remaining thicknesses a trend towards thin sections being more efficient was observed. Random forest analysis generally identified variations in nuclear granularity as the most important features in distinguishing cells. In DS and the thinner tissue sections, nuclear granularity features were more distinguished.
Conclusion
Microsections cut with DS in particular and thin sections in general are better suited for the intended cell classification system.}

The dataset was curated through the running of a prototyping hackathon designed to assess the abilities and performance of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in the early stages of engineering design. This assessment involved comparing ChatGPT's performance to that of experienced engineering students in a hackathon setting, where participants competed by making a prototype that fires a NERF dart as far as possible. In this setup, all ideas, concepts, strategies, and actions undertaken by the AI-controlled team were autonomously generated by the ChatGPT, without human intervention or guidance, but implemented by two participants. Five self-directed baseline teams competed against the AI team. The dataset comprises 116 prototype entries and 433 edges (connection) that enable comparative analysis of design practices and performance between the team instructed solely by generative AI and baseline teams of experienced engineering design students. Prototypes and their attribute data were captured using Pro2booth, an online prototype capture platform running on participants' phones and computers. The dataset includes a transcript of the conversation between ChatGPT and the team responsible for implementing its recommendations, featuring 97 exchanges of prompts and responses. It contains the initial prompt used to instruct the AI, the objective and rules of the hackathon and the objective performance of teams, showing the ChatGPT team finishing 2nd among six teams. To the authors' knowledge, the TrollLabs Open dataset is the first and only open resource that directly compares the performance of generative AI with human teams in an engineering design context. Thus, it is intended to be a valuable resource to design researchers, engineering and design students, educators, and industry professionals seeking to find strategies for implementing generative AI tools in their design processes. By offering a comprehensive data collection, the dataset enables external researchers to conduct in-depth analyses that could highlight the practical implications of integrating generative AI in design practices, possibly providing an overview of its limitations and presenting recommendations for improved integration in the design process.}

Consumer search behavior is a key topic in marketing, economics, and psychology. Across fields, distinct research traditions have emerged, each with its own foundational assumptions and data requirements. Some of these differences stem from conflicting assumptions (e.g., search is Bayesian optimal vs heuristic) while others arise from contextual factors (e.g., search in a visual space vs search in memory). This article proposes an agenda for comparing and extending models of consumer search to support practitioners and researchers in selecting, applying, and refining these models. Ultimately, this may contribute to a more integrated understanding of consumer search. We review five prominent theoretical models, each with distinct terminologies. For each model, we review its background, aims, core assumptions, and provide illustrative examples. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we initiate a synthesis aimed at resolving terminological differences and propose an agenda for model comparison, extension, and integration; and (2) we identify opportunities for future research to advance a more comprehensive understanding of consumer search and choice.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study assessed the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) colonization in rectal swabs from haematological patients with malignancies undergoing routine surveillance and explored the relationship between MDR-GNB colonization and subsequent development of bloodstream infections (BSIs).
Methods
Between January 2020 and September 2022, all patients admitted to our haematology ward underwent weekly MDR-GNB colonization screening via rectal swabs. A retrospective analysis was performed. MDR-GNB were defined per 2022 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases criteria: (a) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCephRE), (b) carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), (c) Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR), and (d) carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
Results
Among 3024 rectal swabs from 699 patients, 503 of 3024 (16.6%) tested positive for MDR-GNB in 192 of 699 patients (27.5%). The most prevalent organisms were Escherichia coli (248/503; 49.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae complex (125/503; 24.9%), and P. aeruginosa (36/503; 7.2%). A total of 59 of 503 (11.7%) colonizations of CRE were identified. Overall, 27 of 192 (14.1%) patients were colonized at admission, primarily by 3GCephRE (27/29; 93.1%). Colonization with CRE and DTR P. aeruginosa was more frequently documented after several days of hospitalization. BSI occurred in 74 of 192 (38.5%) colonized and 61 of 507 (12.0%) non-colonized patients. MDR-GNB caused 57 of 166 BSIs episodes, 50 of 57 (87.7%) of which were in colonized patients. The unadjusted concordance rate between rectal swab isolates and blood cultures was observed in 43 of 90 BSIs (47.8%) occurring in colonized patients, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 36.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.9% for DTR P. aeruginosa; a PPV of 25.0% and an NPV of 99.9% for CRE; and a PPV of 14.6% and an NPV of 99.0% for 3GCephRE.
Discussion
Routine weekly surveillance for MDR-GNB in haematological patients enables early identification of colonization, often preceding MDR-GNB BSIs. Further studies using adjusted analyses are needed to establish its independent predictive value.}

abstract = {Cysticercosis, caused by the larval stage of Taenia solium, is a major zoonotic parasitic disease with a global impact, heightened by immigration and transboundary activities. Recognizing its importance, the World Health Organization has prioritized eliminating taeniasis/cysticercosis by 2030, designating it as a priority neglected tropical disease (NTD). Accurate diagnosis is essential for effective disease control, yet traditional methods often fall short due to low sensitivity of the test and the need for specialized laboratory setups. This study focuses on developing a recombinant Ag2 (rAg2)-based dot blot assay to detect T. solium cysticercosis in pigs. The rAg2 antigen was successfully expressed and purified, with immunoreactivity confirmed against sera from naturally infected pigs. The dot blot test evaluated against serological gold-standard enzyme-linked immunotransfer blot (EITB) assay, demonstrated preliminary laboratory sensitivity (89 %, 95 % CI: 68.6–97.1) and specificity (100 %, 95 % CI: 97.6 - 100), highlighting its potential as a reliable alternative diagnostic method. Cost-effectiveness and minimal laboratory requirements make it particularly suited for field use in resource-limited settings.}

abstract = {Purpose
Successful total knee arthroplasty (TKA) relies on proper ligament balancing with a focus on medial stability. Intra-operative evaluation of the medial flexion gap must account for the relative femur–tibia positioning after implant placement. This study investigated whether intra-operative fine-tuning of the medial gap, enabled by a simple, reproducible spacer block for precise flexion gap measurement, could achieve consistent medial gap matching in both extension and flexion.
Methods
Forty-seven patients (9 men, 38 women) with knee osteoarthritis underwent JOURNEY II bicruciate stabilized TKA. A spacer block simulating post-cam engagement was designed to accurately assess the medial flexion gap. Intra-operative fine-tuning of the medial flexion gap was performed using spacer blocks and a stepless femoral cutting guide. Gaps were measured during the component trial using a tension device and at 1 year post-operatively via stress radiographs.
Results
Initially, 29% of knees exhibited a flexion–extension gap difference ≥2 ​mm after posterior cruciate ligament resection and tibial osteotomy. Spacer block fine-tuning reduced this to 8% and this improvement persisted at 1 year. At 4 years follow-up, Knee Society Scores were favorable, with significant gains in extension and flexion angles.
Conclusion
The developed spacer block technique, which replicates the post-cam engaging position, provided consistent and accurate flexion gap measurements and reduced flexion–extension discrepancies. This approach enhanced knee stability and patient outcome post-TKA.}

Pediatric patients with sustained tachyarrhythmias present unique challenges to prehospital clinicians due to differences in physiology, pathology, compensatory mechanisms, and treatment algorithms. Additionally, pediatric patients require careful thought into the psychosocial impacts that one's demeanor, treatment, and explanations will have on them.
Case report
This case illustrates an adolescent male with a history of Chiari 1 malformation who presented to EMS with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). An unusual rhythm response was experienced during electrical cardioversion, where this intervention resulted in an immediate doubling of his heart rate.
Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?
We discuss approaches to pediatric dysrhythmias, differential diagnosis considerations, appropriate management of wide-complex tachycardia, and methods to reduce the psychological burden on patients and families in a first-encounter clinical situation.}

abstract = {Objective
Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is advisable to promote better prognosis. The Mini-TEA scale was conceived as a sensitive screening for ASD among children. The authors aimed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of the scale in a wider population.
Method
279 children from 2.5 to 12 yo were recruited, most of them under evaluation for possible ASD in the APAE of Passo Fundo/RS, as well as children with other diagnoses and normal children. Their parents/relatives answered the 48 binary questions (yes/no) of the Mini-TEA scale, divided into 15 items, which resulted in a score from 0 to 15. After that, the children were evaluated regarding the diagnostic criteria of ASD by experienced raters (gold standard) who had previously submitted to a concordance test and remained unaware of the children’s scores. Sensitivity and specificity Figs. were obtained. Factor analysis and Item Response Theory approaches were used for validity evidence.
Results
115 children were diagnosed with ASD. Scores ≥9 had 98.3 % of sensitivity and 62.2 % of specificity for the diagnosis. Two cases with the typical presentation of Asperger’s syndrome scored lower than 9. The mean time for screening was about 8.5 min. The validation model presented excellent coefficients of factorability. The analysis showed that the total variance of the scores of the scale through the 15 items was explained only by the set of ASD symptoms (unidimensionality).
Conclusion
The Mini-TEA scale is a very sensitive tool to screen for ASD and has high internal consistency for assessing typical autistic symptoms.}

abstract = {Summary
The risk of drug interactions in patients with HTN is aggravated when prescribing treatments for additional acute pathologies. This can favor adverse reactions to medications or make it difficult to control blood pressure during their stay in the emergency room.
Objective
Identify and classify, using CDSS, the IFFs between the antihypertensive treatment regimen and the drugs prescribed in the emergency department.
Material and methods
Fifty-three patients with systemic arterial hypertension were treated in the emergency department. Clinical decision support systems are used to identify and classify potential FFs.
Results
IFFs were found in 96.2% of hypertensive patients in the emergency department. Those with the highest frequency were of moderate risk. The most frequent mechanism was pharmacodynamic, mainly synergistic by ad-dition.
Conclusions
The correlation index between the number of drugs prescribed in the emer-gency room and the presence of IFF shows the need to carry out a scrutiny of the joint pharmaco-logical behavior used in hypertensive patients who attend emergency medical care to rationalize the use of medications reducing the probability of presenting IFF.
Résumé
Le risque d’interactions médicamenteuses chez les patients hypertendus est aggravé lors de la prescription de traitements pour des pathologies aiguës supplémentaires. Cela peut favoriser les réactions indésirables aux médicaments ou rendre difficile le contrôle de la pression artérielle pendant leur séjour au service des urgences.
Objectif
Identifier et classifier, à l’aide du système d’aide à la décision clinique (CDSS), les IFF entre le schéma de traitement antihypertenseur et les médicaments prescrits au service des urgences.
Matériels et méthodes
Cinquante-trois patients souffrant d’hypertension artérielle systémique ont été traités au service des urgences. Les systèmes d’aide à la décision clinique sont utilisés pour identifier et classifier les IFF potentiels.
Résultats
Des IFF ont été trouvées chez 96,2 % des patients hypertendus au service des urgences. Ceux de fréquence la plus élevée étaient de risque modéré. Le mécanisme le plus fréquent était pharmacodynamique, principalement synergique par addition.
Conclusion
L’indice de corrélation entre le nombre de médicaments prescrits au service des urgences et la présence d’IFF montre la nécessité d’effectuer un examen du comportement pharmacologique conjoint utilisé chez les patients hypertendus qui se présentent aux soins médicaux d’urgence pour rationaliser l’utilisation des médicaments et réduire la probabilité de présenter des IFF.}

Recent comparative studies with closely related NHPs at the single-cell resolution using multimodal genomic profiling, assisted with high-throughput functional screening have provided unprecedented insights into human-specific brain features and their genetic underpinnings. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge of human brain evolution at cellular and molecular levels, emphasizing how genetic changes have shaped these adaptations.

This has created the need for transformative change in the agricultural sector, with soil health playing a key role in this transition. Soil health is essential for agricultural productivity, economic viability, and ecosystem resilience, while also advancing sustainability and inclusivity. Achieving these outcomes depends on effective soil management, but slow growth in fertilizer use and limited understanding of its efficiency by farmers pose significant challenges. The Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit (Nairobi, May 2024) underscored the urgency of these challenges, endorsing the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan. This commentary outlines key considerations for successful implementation of the plan, highlighting enabling conditions and strategic approaches: (1) trusted multi-sectoral partnerships fostering collaboration among farmers, governments, private companies, non-governmental organisations, and donors, (2) demand-driven research and development with strong focus on measurable development outcomes, (3) targeted investments and finance effectively expanding the role of the private sector, (4) effective policy mandates relying on comprehensive policy mixes, and (5) inclusive capacity-building using gender-transformative approaches. These strategic contributions are essential to achieving sustainable, equitable agricultural transformation in Africa. The transformation will demand innovation, long-term commitment, and coordinated action across sectors to ensure impact beyond the timeframe of the African Fertilizer and Soil Health Action Plan.}

abstract = {T1N0 non-small cell lung cancers account for about 20 % of all lung cancer cases and are defined as tumours up to 3cm without nodal or distant metastasis. The incidence of early-stage diagnoses is increasing, largely driven by the implementation of low dose computed tomography screening programs. Surgery has long been considered the standard of care for these tumours, offering excellent oncologic outcomes and allowing essential pathological staging. However, surgery may be indicated or poorly tolerated in certain populations, particularly elderly or medically inoperable patients. Stereotactic body radiotherapy has emerged as a non-invasive alternative with high local control rates and reduced early morbidity. This raises a critical question: should all patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer be managed surgically, or is there a role for treatment individualization? Current evidence highlights the need of balancing curative intent with treatment-related risks. Several clinical trials are currently evaluating stereotactic body radiotherapy in operable patients, aiming to identify subsets that may derive benefit from a non-surgical approach. This review advocates for a personalized, patient-centred treatment strategy, integrating tumour characteristics, operability, comorbidities, and patient preference.
Résumé
Le cancer bronchique non à petites cellules de stade T1N0 représente environ 20 % des cancers du poumon et correspond à des tumeurs de taille inférieure ou égale à 3cm sans atteinte ganglionnaire ni métastase à distance. La fréquence des diagnostics à un stade précoce est en augmentation grâce à la généralisation du dépistage par scanographie thoracique. Traditionnellement, la chirurgie constitue le traitement de référence, offrant des taux de guérison élevés ainsi qu’un accès indispensable au bilan histopathologique complet. Toutefois, elle n’est pas toujours indiquée, notamment chez les patients âgés ou fragiles. La radiothérapie en conditions stéréotaxiques s’est imposée comme une alternative, avec des taux de contrôle local élevés et une morbidité aiguë moindre. Cette évolution soulève une question essentielle : tous les patients doivent-ils être opérés, ou un traitement personnalisé est-il envisageable ? Les données actuelles soulignent la nécessité de concilier l’intention curative avec le risque de morbidité. Plusieurs essais cliniques explorent actuellement l’utilisation de la radiothérapie en conditions stéréotaxiques chez des patients opérables, dans le but d’identifier des sous-groupes susceptibles d’en tirer bénéfice.

abstract = {Objective
Acquired anterior glottic webs are the result of trauma, iatrogenic, radiation, or inflammation to the anterior commissure, resulting in narrowing of the airway and elevated pitch. They are very challenging to treat, and contemporary management strategies typically involve repeat procedures under general anesthesia with high rates of web recurrence. We aim to describe a novel treatment for anterior glottic webs with potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser treatment that are performed in-office under topical anesthesia.
Methods
This is a retrospective chart review of six patients with an anterior glottic web who were managed in an office setting with KTP laser between the years 2019 and 2023. Demographic data, patient reported outcome measures, and treatment details were collected. Preprocedure and postprocedure video laryngoscopy was collected, and representative images were evaluated by blinded laryngologists. The reviewer, blinded to treatment status, was asked to measure the length of the vocal fold from vocal process to current anterior commissure and in addition, measure vocal process to expected ideal anterior commissure. The percentage change in length of the anterior glottic web is then calculated and reported.
Results
Six patients were included in the study, all tolerated the procedure well, and no adverse events. Patient follow up was on average 7 months (5 weeks to 3.1 years), with three of six patients having approximately 3 years follow up. All patients had a reduction in the length of the anterior glottic web, with an average pretreatment web length 40.4%, falling to 15.4% postKTP; t(6) = 3.43, 95%CI [6.29-43.71], P < 0.05. There were no significant change in VHI-10 scores post treatment t(3) = 1.73, 95% CI [−2.93−9.93].
Conclusions
KTP is a novel in-office treatment that offers promising and potentially durable results in the management of anterior glottic web.

The paper then highlights some problems by attending to the tokenistic engagement with epistemology and ontology plus some associated fallacies. Some thoughts about how qualitative research in sport and exercise psychology might develop are next offered. To help support the ongoing development of qualitative research we attend to interviewing, story completion, analysis, computer-assisted software, artificial intelligence (AI), and digital methods. The paper also provides a note on physical activity guidelines, qualitative research, and policy-making. It closes by reaffirming the need to approach qualitative research as a slow craft that involves people (not AI) making tough, well-thought-out ethical, theoretical, and methodological decisions.}

abstract = {Introduction and importance
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an extremely rare sarcoma mainly reported in the lung. The adrenal gland, however, is an extremely rare site of occurrence. Herein, we report a case of a large adrenal mass with no contributory imaging features presenting a challenging pathological diagnosis.
Case presentation
A healthy 32-year-old male patient, with no personal nor family history, presented with loss of body weight and condition developing for two months. Physical examination revealed no abnormalities with a soft and depressible abdomen and absence of palpable lump. Circulating Chromogranin A and catecholamine metabolites were within normal range. The preoperative imaging features were noncontributory. The pathological examination on biopsy specimen concluded to a spindle cell proliferation set in a chronically inflamed background suggesting the diagnosis of IMT. The patient, subsequently, underwent radical nephrectomy unveiling a 25 cm adrenal mass. Pathological findings on resection specimen confirmed the diagnosis of IMT of the left adrenal gland.
Clinical discussion
Due to their rarity in the adrenal gland and their noncontributory radiological features, IMTs are typically not considered as a potential diagnosis in this location. As a result, this condition is often underdiagnosed. In this setting, suspicion for IMT should be raised when spindle cell histology is observed.
Conclusion
It is fundamental for practicians to keep this entity in mind as the treatment consists of complete tumor extirpation. The latter being the only guarantee of recurrence free follow up.}

abstract = {Background: Neuromyths are widespread among educators, which raises concerns about misconceptions regarding the (neural) principles underlying learning in the educator population. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education, educators are increasingly relying on these for lesson planning and professional development. Therefore, if LLMs correctly identify neuromyths, they may help to dispute related misconceptions. Method: We evaluated whether LLMs can correctly identify neuromyths and whether they may hint educators to neuromyths in applied contexts when users ask questions comprising related misconceptions. Additionally, we examined whether explicitly prompting LLMs to base their answer on scientific evidence or to correct unsupported assumptions would decrease errors in identifying neuromyths. Results: LLMs outperformed humans in identifying neuromyth statements as used in previous studies. However, when presented with applied user-like questions comprising misconceptions, they struggled to highlight or dispute these. Interestingly, explicitly asking LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions increased the likelihood that misconceptions were flagged considerably, while prompting the models to rely on scientific evidence had only little effects. Conclusion: While LLMs outperformed humans at identifying isolated neuromyth statements, they struggled to hint users towards the same misconception when they were included in more applied user-like questions—presumably due to LLMs’ tendency toward sycophantic responses. This limitation suggests that, despite their potential, LLMs are not yet a reliable safeguard against the spread of neuromyths in educational settings. However, when users explicitly prompt LLMs to correct unsupported assumptions—an approach that may initially seem counterintuitive–this effectively reduced sycophantic responses.}

This study investigates the attitudes of English major students toward peer feedback in academic writing classes, using Sociocultural Theory as the analytical framework. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, the study first surveyed 142 students to quantify general trends in attitudes, followed by semi-structured interviews with 12 participants to explore the sociocultural dimensions underpinning those attitudes. Findings indicate that while students generally perceive peer feedback as beneficial for their academic development, their engagement is notably shaped by sociocultural factors including face-saving norms, perceived proficiency hierarchies, and interpersonal relationship dynamics. Significantly, students strongly preferred anonymity in peer feedback to mitigate emotional discomfort and enhance objectivity. The study concludes that incorporating anonymous feedback mechanisms in peer review activities substantially addresses sociocultural constraints and improves student engagement, thus representing a key strategy for effective writing instruction in EFL contexts. These insights underscore the importance of culturally responsive pedagogical practices and provide clear implications for instructional design in writing pedagogy.}

At the primary analysis of the EV-302 trial, enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab (EV+P) demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (la/mUC).
Patients and methods
We present an updated analysis of efficacy and safety in the overall population, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years, providing an additional year of follow-up since the primary analysis.
Results
The median PFS by blinded independent central review was 12.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-16.6 months] for the EV+P arm and 6.3 months (95% CI 6.2-6.5 months) for the chemotherapy arm [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.41-0.57]. The median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI 26.1-39.3 months) for the EV+P arm and 15.9 months (95% CI 13.6-18.3 months) for the chemotherapy arm (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43-0.61). Safety data with an additional year of follow-up were consistent with those of the primary analysis.
Conclusion
The continued survival benefit with EV+P compared with chemotherapy in this updated analysis reinforces EV+P as the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with la/mUC.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming musculoskeletal research, offering new approaches to diagnosis, prognosis, and patient management in osteoarthritis (OA). However, implementation and ethical challenges persist. This manuscript summarizes insights from the OARSI 2025 Pre-Congress Workshop on Artificial Intelligence in Osteoarthritis Research, highlighting opportunities and challenges in applying AI across biomechanics, imaging, and clinical research domains.
Design
The workshop, organized by the OARSI Early Career Investigator Committee and co-chaired by Drs. Matthew Harkey and Brooke Patterson, convened experts to discuss the use of AI in real-world biomechanics data collection, radiomics for imaging-based biomarkers, and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and research applications. Emphasis was placed on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical oversight.
Results
In biomechanics, AI-driven markerless motion capture and wearable sensors enable scalable, ecologically valid data collection, though issues such as class imbalance, data privacy, and model interpretability remain. In imaging, radiomics and deep learning models show promise for early OA detection and progression prediction but face challenges in domain adaptation and external validation. In clinical research, LLMs can streamline documentation and thematic analysis but must address concerns around bias, data security, and transparency. Across domains, transparency, reproducibility, and ethical use of AI were emphasized as critical for maintaining scientific rigor.
Conclusions
Cross-disciplinary collaboration and AI literacy are essential to responsibly advance AI integration in OA research. The workshop's collective insights call for ethical, patient-centered approaches that leverage AI's strengths while preserving research integrity and trust.}

Compared with traditional social real objects, chatbots are more controllable in social relationships. At the same time, compared with traditional real social objects, chatbots may show better emotional identification with objects. The structural equation modeling is a path analysis method based on the factor analysis and linear regression, which can be used to analyze the path relationship between intricate variables. Based on the structural equation modeling, this paper analyzes the potential pathways for artificial intelligence chatbots to induce the user's emotional dependence. The results show that the “sense of identification” and “sense of control” will cause people to have emotional dependence on the artificial intelligence chatbots, with p < 0.05. However, the psychological distance plays a regulating role in the identification-emotional dependence and the sense of control-emotional dependence, respectively. The research results in this paper show that there is a certain theoretical basis for the chatting intelligent robots to transform from a tool role to a social and emotional role.}

abstract = {Mural sketches reveal both the content and structure of the murals and are crucial for the preservation of murals. However, existing methods lack robustness, making it difficult to suppress noise while preserving sketches on damaged murals and fully capturing details on clear murals. To address this, we propose a Data Uncertainty-Driven Robust Network (DURN) for mural sketch detection. DURN uses uncertainty to quantify noise in the murals, converting prediction into a learnable normal distribution, where the mean represents the sketch and the variance denotes the uncertainty. This enables the model to learn both the sketch and the noise simultaneously, achieving noise suppression while preserving the sketches. To enhance sketches, we design an Adaptive Fusion Feature Enhancement Module (AFFE) to dynamically adjust the fusion strategy according to the contribution of features at different scales and reduce the information loss caused by feature dimensionality reduction to maximize the utility of each feature. We develop a novel Deep-Shallow Supervision (DSS) module to mitigate background noise using deep semantic information to guide shallow features without adding parameters. Additionally, we achieve model lightweighting through pruning techniques, ensuring competitive performance while reducing the number of parameters to only 4.5 % of the original. The experimental results show an improvement of 10. 4 % AP over existing methods, demonstrating the robustness of DURN for complex and damaged murals.

abstract = {Background
Cognitive assessment is an important component of applied psychology, but limited access and high costs make these evaluations challenging.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) to create personalized artificial intelligence–based verbal comprehension tests (AI-BVCTs) for assessing verbal intelligence, in contrast with traditional assessment methods based on standardized norms.
Methods
We used a within-participants design, comparing scores obtained from AI-BVCTs with those from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) verbal comprehension index (VCI). In total, 8 Hebrew-speaking participants completed both the VCI and AI-BVCT, the latter being generated using the LLM Claude.
Results
The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) demonstrated strong agreement between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (Claude: CCC=.75, 90% CI 0.266-0.933; GPT-4: CCC=.73, 90% CI 0.170-0.935). Pearson correlations further supported these findings, showing strong associations between VCI and AI-BVCT scores (Claude: r=.84, P<.001; GPT-4: r=.77, P=.02). No statistically significant differences were found between AI-BVCT and VCI scores (P>.05).
Conclusions
These findings support the potential of LLMs to assess verbal intelligence. The study attests to the promise of AI-based cognitive tests in increasing the accessibility and affordability of assessment processes, enabling personalized testing. The research also raises ethical concerns regarding privacy and overreliance on AI in clinical work. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to establish the validity and reliability of this approach and develop more accurate scoring procedures.}

Using AMOS software and the CB-SEM structural equation model to analyze valid data, this study reveals the significant impact of subjective norms, cognitive attitudes, and perceived behavioral control on usage intention in different design contexts. It also highlights the differentiated influence of external variables, such as system information quality, on intermediary variables like subjective norms. Through these analyses, the study clarifies the specific impact mechanisms of various external variables on behavioral intention. This study offers a new perspective on understanding designers' cognitive acceptance of generative AI image tools and proposes differentiated promotion and training strategies, providing valuable guidance for industry practice.}

abstract = {Factor V Leiden as a mutant gene defect of hereditary thrombophilia exists peculiarly in Caucasians but almost absent in people traditionally living in Asia. This lopsided dispensation has persisted as an enigma to be solved. Thus, a hypothesis is raised here that the Black Death, a plague pandemic caused by Yersinia pestis, which ravaged Europe in the fourteenth century and brought on a severe human extermination constituted the pathogenic selective pressure for factor V Leiden of which the procoagulative, anti-fibrinlolysis function, and the resultant resistance potential to Yersinia pestis infection have been demonstrated in a series of animal experiments and clinical observation. The same explanation is also proposed for a similar unbalanced distribution of prothrombin G20210A mutation, another thrombophilia genetic variant, between Caucasians and Asians despite awaiting more solid evidence in the near future. On the other hand, the fact that deficiency of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin had not risen during the plague disaster is theoretically attributed to more severe and fatal disseminated intravascular coagulation associated with the dysfunction of them. The whole assumption implies an underlying evolutionary advantage of factor V Leiden and a mysterious relationship between genetic traits and diseases. It is hoped that future investigations dedicating to analysis of ancient DNA from human remains in the medieval cemeteries before, during, and after the plague will finally let the speculation come true.}

To assess the clinical reasoning capabilities of two large language models, ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0, compared to those of neonatal nurses during neonatal care scenarios.
Design
A cross-sectional study with a comparative evaluation using a survey instrument that included six neonatal intensive care unit clinical scenarios.
Participants
32 neonatal intensive care nurses with 5–10 years of experience working in the neonatal intensive care units of three medical centers.
Methods
Participants responded to 6 written clinical scenarios. Simultaneously, we asked ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 to provide initial assessments and treatment recommendations for the same scenarios. The responses from ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 were then scored by certified neonatal nurse practitioners for accuracy, completeness, and response time.
Results
Both models demonstrated capabilities in clinical reasoning for neonatal care, with Claude-2.0 significantly outperforming ChatGPT-4 in clinical accuracy and speed. However, limitations were identified across the cases in diagnostic precision, treatment specificity, and response lag.
Conclusions
While showing promise, current limitations reinforce the need for deep refinement before ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 can be considered for integration into clinical practice. Additional validation of these tools is important to safely leverage this Artificial Intelligence technology for enhancing clinical decision-making.
Impact
The study provides an understanding of the reasoning accuracy of new Artificial Intelligence models in neonatal clinical care. The current accuracy gaps of ChatGPT-4 and Claude-2.0 need to be addressed prior to clinical usage.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have dominated public interest due to their apparent capability to accurately replicate learned knowledge in narrative text. However, there is a lack of clarity about the accuracy and capability standards of LLMs in health care examinations.
Objective
We conducted a systematic review of LLM accuracy, as tested under health care examination conditions, as compared to known human performance standards.
Methods
We quantified the accuracy of LLMs in responding to health care examination questions and evaluated the consistency and quality of study reporting. The search included all papers up until September 10, 2023, with all LLMs published in English journals that report clear LLM accuracy standards. The exclusion criteria were as follows: the assessment was not a health care exam, there was no LLM, there was no evaluation of comparable success accuracy, and the literature was not original research.The literature search included the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used in all possible combinations: “artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” “GPT,” “LLM,” “large language model,” “machine learning,” “neural network,” “Generative Pre-trained Transformer,” “Generative Transformer,” “Generative Language Model,” “Generative Model,” “medical exam,” “healthcare exam,” and “clinical exam.” Sensitivity, accuracy, and precision data were extracted, including relevant CIs.
Results
The search identified 1673 relevant citations. After removing duplicate results, 1268 (75.8%) papers were screened for titles and abstracts, and 32 (2.5%) studies were included for full-text review. Our meta-analysis suggested that LLMs are able to perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.61 (CI 0.58-0.64) and a United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) accuracy of 0.51 (CI 0.46-0.56), while Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) can perform with an overall medical examination accuracy of 0.64 (CI 0.6-0.67).
Conclusions
LLMs offer promise to remediate health care demand and staffing challenges by providing accurate and efficient context-specific information to critical decision makers. For policy and deployment decisions about LLMs to advance health care, we proposed a new framework called RUBRICC (Regulatory, Usability, Bias, Reliability [Evidence and Safety], Interoperability, Cost, and Codesign–Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement [PPIE]). This presents a valuable opportunity to direct the clinical commissioning of new LLM capabilities into health services, while respecting patient safety considerations.

keywords = {Urate, Reference values, Cardiometabolic syndrome, Urato, Valores de referencia, Síndrome cardiometabólico},
abstract = {Background
Urate is the final product of purine catabolism, and its levels have been linked to various cardiometabolic disorders. In Mexico, most epidemiological data on urate levels derive from populations with existing comorbidities, limiting the establishment of normative reference values.
Objective
To characterize the distribution of serum urate concentrations in a healthy adult population residing in Mexico City.
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 3099 healthy adults (64.6% women) enrolled in the Tlalpan 2020 cohort. Participants with chronic diseases, abnormal blood pressure or glucose levels, or exposure to urate-altering medications were excluded. Clinical, anthropometric, and biochemical parameters were recorded, and serum urate concentrations were analyzed overall and stratified by sex.
Results
The median serum urate level in the overall cohort was 5.16mg/dL (interquartile range, 4.32–6.15), with a central 95% reference interval ranging from 3.05 to 7.98mg/dL. Median urate levels differed significantly by sex: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) in women and 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) in men. The prevalence of hyperuricemia in the total cohort was 16.5%, notably higher in men (28.4%) compared to women (10.0%).
Conclusion
This study establishes sex-specific reference values for serum urate in a healthy Mexican adult population. The findings may inform clinical decision-making and future research on urate-related risk stratification.
Resumen
Antecedentes
El urato es el producto final del catabolismo de las purinas y su concentración se ha asociado con diversos trastornos cardiometabólicos. En México, la mayoría de los datos epidemiológicos sobre los niveles de urato provienen de poblaciones con comorbilidades existentes, lo que limita el establecimiento de valores de referencia normativos.
Objetivo
Caracterizar la distribución de las concentraciones séricas de urato en una población adulta sana residente en la Ciudad de México.
Métodos
Se realizó un análisis transversal utilizando datos de 3,099 adultos sanos (64.6% mujeres) incluidos en la cohorte Tlalpan 2020. Se excluyeron participantes con enfermedades crónicas, cifras anormales de presión arterial o glucosa, o exposición a medicamentos que alteran el urato. Se registraron parámetros clínicos, antropométricos y bioquímicos, y las concentraciones de urato se analizaron de forma global y estratificadas por sexo.
Resultados
La mediana de urato sérico en la cohorte fue de 5.16mg/dL (rango intercuartílico: 4.32–6.15), con un intervalo de referencia (95%) que oscila entre 3.05 y 7.98mg/dL. Las concentraciones de urato difirieron significativamente por sexo: 4.60mg/dL (3.99–5.28) en mujeres y 6.39mg/dL (5.61–7.09) en hombres. La prevalencia de hiperuricemia en la cohorte total fue de 16.5%, siendo mayor en hombres (28.4%) que en mujeres (10.0%).
Conclusión
Este estudio establece valores de referencia de urato específicos por sexo en una población mexicana adulta sana. Los hallazgos pueden ser útiles para la toma de decisiones y para futuras investigaciones sobre la estratificación del riesgo relacionado con el urato.}

abstract = {Introduction
Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a rare condition in athletes and musicians who perform repeated prolonged forced gripping movements. It mainly affects young men, and presents with cramp-like pain, beginning on the anteromedial side of the forearm and progressively extending to the entire circumference, and may be associated with muscle weakness and neurologic symptoms. The objective of this study was to report preliminary results of ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome.
Material and methods
A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted. Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome was diagnosed on clinical presentation and pathological intramuscular pressure measurement, defined as >30 mmHg at 1 min after effort. The series comprised 7 men, with bilateral involvement. Mean age was 30 years. All patients were motorcyclists. The mean preoperative intramuscular pressure at 1 min after effort was 60.75 mmHg (range: 30−81 mmHg). The main study endpoint was change in pain on visual analogic scale. Secondary endpoints comprised patient satisfaction, change in competitive sports level, and time to return to sport. Complications were noted.
Results
Six patients (12 forearms) were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 22.5 months (range: 3–48 months). Mean pain rating was 7.3/10 (range: 6–9) preoperatively, and 0/10 postoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the procedure. Mean time to return to sports was 25.5 days (range: 21–30 days). No patients decreased their competitive sports level after the procedure. One patient presented a postoperative hematoma, not requiring surgery.
Conclusion
Ultrasound-guided fasciotomy in the treatment of Forearm chronic exertional compartment syndrome is an innovative technique with promising preliminary results.

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, is transforming healthcare by offering novel ways to synthesize and communicate medical knowledge. This development is especially relevant in cardiology, as patient education, clinical decision-making, and administrative workflows play pivotal roles in this area. ChatGPT, originally built on GPT-3 and refined into GPT-4, can simplify complex cardiology literature, translate technical explanations into plain language, and address questions across different linguistic backgrounds. Studies show that although ChatGPT demonstrates considerable promise in performing text-based tasks—ranging from passing portions of the European Exam in Core Cardiology to creating patient-friendly educational materials—its inability to interpret images remains a major limitation. Meanwhile, concerns around false information, data bias, and ethical issues highlight the need for careful oversight. Future directions include integrating LLMs with computer-vision modules for image-based diagnostics and combining unstructured patient data to improve risk prediction and phenotyping. Social-media research suggests that chatbots sometimes provide more-empathetic responses than do physicians, underscoring both their potential advantages and complexities. LLM-based tools can also generate letters for insurance prior authorizations or appeals, helping reduce administrative burden. New multimodal approaches, such as ChatGPT Vision, have the potential to enable direct image processing, although clinical validation of this function is yet to be established. The judicious integration of ChatGPT and other LLMs into cardiology requires ongoing validation, robust regulatory frameworks, and strong ethical guidelines to ensure patient privacy, avoid misinformation, and promote equitable healthcare delivery. This review aims to provide a primer on LLMs for cardiovascular professionals, summarizing key applications, current limitations, and prospects in this rapidly evolving field of digital health.
Résumé
L'intelligence artificielle (IA) générative, en particulier les grands modèles de langage (LLM) tels que ChatGPT, transforme les soins de santé en offrant de nouveaux moyens de synthétiser et de communiquer les connaissances médicales. Ceci est particulièrement pertinent en cardiologie, où l'éducation des patients, la prise de décision clinique et les flux de travail administratifs jouent un rôle central. ChatGPT, basé à l'origine sur GPT-3 et affiné dans GPT-4, peut simplifier la littérature complexe en cardiologie, traduire des explications techniques en langage clair et répondre à des questions provenant de différents contextes linguistiques. Les études montrent que si ChatGPT démontre un potentiel très prometteur pour les tâches basées sur le texte - qui vont de la réussite de certaines parties de l'examen européen de cardiologie de base à la création de matériel éducatif accessible aux patients - son incapacité à interpréter les images reste une limitation majeure. Par ailleurs, les inquiétudes concernant les renseignements faux, les biais de données et les questions éthiques soulignent la nécessité d'une supervision attentive. Les orientations futures comprennent l'intégration des LLM avec des modules de vision par ordinateur pour les diagnostics basés sur l'image et la combinaison de données non structurées sur les patients pour améliorer la prédiction des risques et le phénotypage. Les recherches sur les médias sociaux suggèrent que les agents conversationnels peuvent parfois fournir des réponses plus empathiques que les médecins, révélant des opportunités et les complications inhérentes. Pour les tâches administratives, les outils basés sur les LLM peuvent générer des lettres pour les demandes d'autorisation préalable ou des appels, contribuant ainsi à réduire la charge administrative. De nouvelles approches multimodales, telles que « ChatGPT Vision », pourraient à l'avenir permettre un traitement direct des images, bien que la validation clinique reste à établir. En fin de compte, l'intégration judicieuse de ChatGPT et d'autres LLM en cardiologie nécessitera une validation continue, des cadres réglementaires solides et des lignes directrices éthiques strictes pour garantir la confidentialité des patients, éviter la désinformation et promouvoir une prestation de soins de santé équitable. Cette étude a pour but de fournir aux professionnels de la santé cardiovasculaire une introduction aux LLM, en résumant les applications clés, les limites actuelles et les perspectives dans ce domaine de la santé numérique qui évolue rapidement.}

The National Library of Medicine’s Integrated Academic/Advanced Information Management Systems (IAIMS) initiative played a central role in the evolution of health informatics over the project’s lifetime (1983–2009) and continues to do so.
Aim
Our objective is to demonstrate how IAIMS and two key IAIMS concepts, integration and outreach, have functioned at very different times during this evolutionary process.
Approach
Using a framework drawn from Lorenzi and Stead’s 2021 history of IAIMS, we examine the role of integration and outreach in work at the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) in the early 1980s and at the University of Texas Arlington (UTA) in 2020.
Results
Guided by these concepts, UMB implemented a campus-wide information utility, while UTA established a center to accelerate research and innovation.
Conclusions
Outreach and integration have been formative in the evolution of health informatics and will continue to hold their power.}

Given the expected time until the heat death of the universe, we demonstrate that the widely-accepted conclusion from the Infinite Monkeys Theorem is, in fact, misleading in our finite universe. As such, this places the theorem in a class of probabilistic problems or paradoxes, including the St. Petersburg paradox, Zeno's dichotomy paradox and the Ross–Littlewood paradox wherein the infinite-resource conclusions directly contradict those obtained when considering limited resources, however sizeable.}

abstract = {Summary
Introduction
Simulated paediatric surgical training is inherently advantageous and flourishing. Moreover, several working conditions resulted in reduced training hours, index and subspecialty cases encountered, and the COVID-19 pandemic affected elective surgery backlogs, hence training opportunities. Hypospadias repair is technically-demanding and requires a spectrum of dissective and reconstructive skills. We therefore aimed to test a 3D-printed silicon model for hypospadias repair, in the context of hands-on surgical training.
Material and methods
Twenty-Seven trainees, under the supervision of 15 instructors, completed the activity. They were given a seminar to show the relevant anatomy, and 8 key steps of the exercise: (1)-degloving; (2)-urethral plate marking; (3)-incision; (4)-tubularisation; (5)-glansplasty/glanuloplasty; (6)-dartos layer preparation; (7)-preputioplasty and (8)-skin closure. Each trainee completed a structured feedback assessment. An on-site trainer supervised and evaluated each exercise. Trainees and trainers rated the model through the above steps from unsatisfactory-(1/5) to excellent-(5/5), presented herein via cross-sectional analysis.
Results
Eleven-(40.7 %) trainees were in years:1–3 of specialist training, 10-(37 %) were in years:4–6, and 6-(22.2 %) were beyond year-6. Two-(7.4 %) trainees had nil-hypospadias experience, 16-(59.2 %) previously assisted in procedures or performed steps, 5-(18.5 %) performed whole procedures supervised and 4-(14.8 %) independently. Twenty-(74 %) trainees and 15-(100 %) instructors judged the model to resemble the anomaly. Seventeen-(63 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated the material needle-penetrability ≥3/5, compared to human tissue. Sixteen-(59 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated the material suture holding ≥3/5. Eleven-(73.3 %) trainees and 13-(86.6 %) instructors rated sutures’ evenness and edge coaptability ≥3/5.
Discussion
Hypospadias is an index operation, which requires precision skills. Simulated training in Paediatric Surgery and Urology is gaining importance. 3D-printed models are gaining a key role in simulated training. The study presents a novel 3D-printed high-fidelity silicon-based hypospadias model designed for hands-on training. A structured pathway to divide a standard hypospadias repair into key steps is displayed to ensure skill acquisition and stabilisation.
Conclusion
This 3D-printed silicon-based hypospadias model is proven useful for hands-on training. The fidelity can still improve, especially regarding suture holding of the material.

Comparative analysis with four demographically matched traditional cohorts (n = 93) revealed that GenAI-supported instruction significantly improved assignment performance. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression confirmed that AI integration was a robust and statistically significant predictor of higher scores, even after controlling for demographic and professional background variables. Simultaneous quantile regression further showed that lower-performing students experienced the greatest gains, highlighting the intervention's equalizing potential. Beyond these quantitative results, students demonstrated more structured economic reasoning and deeper conceptual application. By emphasizing faculty agency, ethical AI use, and inquiry-based design, this model offers a scalable and replicable approach for integrating GenAI in executive education.}

As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth—namely that highly hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and cell envelope morphology (hops are not equally effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre- and post-assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application.}

Firstly, based on the definition of prescribed time stability, a lemma of practical prescribed time stability is proposed, which guarantees the system states converge to a region within the prescribed time. Secondly, a prescribed time SMC method is designed, which does not contain negative power terms in the controller and solves the singular problem. In addition, a continuous function is adopted instead of the sign function to reduce chattering, and it is also considered in the stability proof. The stability analysis shows that whatever it is in the sliding stage or the reaching stage, the tracking error is prescribed time stable. On the basis of prescribed time SMC method, the neural network (NN) is introduced to approximate the unknown model information. Finally, compared with other existing control methods, the results of simulation demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits superior performance, encompassing the achievement of prescribed time stability, the elimination of chattering, and the capability to analyze unknown model information via neural networks.}
