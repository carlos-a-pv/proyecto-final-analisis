abstract = {Background
Digital health technologies are widely used for disease management, with their computing platforms, software, and sensors being used for health care. These technologies are developed to manage chronic diseases and infectious bacterial diseases, including tuberculosis (TB).
Objective
This study aims to comprehensively review the literature on the use of digital health interventions (DHIs) for enhancing TB treatment adherence and identify major strategies for their adoption.
Methods
We conducted a literature search in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, and Scopus databases for relevant studies published between January 2012 and March 2022. Studies that focused on web-based or mobile phone–based interventions, medication adherence, digital health, randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, or mobile health and ubiquitous health technology for TB treatment and related health outcomes were included.
Results
We identified 27 relevant studies and classified them according to the intervention method, a significant difference in treatment success, and health outcomes. The following interventions were emphasized: SMS text messaging interventions (8/27, 30%), medicine reminders (6/27, 22%), and web-based direct observation therapy (9/27, 33%). Digital health technology significantly promoted disease management among individuals and health care professionals. However, only a few studies addressed 2-way communication therapies, such as interactive SMS text messaging and feedback systems.
Conclusions
This scoping review classified studies on DHIs for patients with TB and demonstrated their potential for the self-management of TB. DHIs are still being developed, and evidence on the impact of digital technologies on enhancing TB treatment adherence remains limited. However, it is necessary to encourage patients’ participation in TB treatment and self-management through bidirectional communication. We emphasize the importance of developing a communication system.}

PCR-based genotyping, such as enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (Rep) PCR, and protein profiling using outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and whole cell proteins (WCPs) were studied. Despite their different sources, PCR-based methods revealed genetic similarity between antibiotic-resistant and sensitive isolates. The protein profile also showed varying bands around the 29–43 kDa region. The PCR-based techniques were found to be dependable and repeatable. While the OMPs and WCPs profiles limited the selectiveness of the molecular typing techniques, they could still help determine the most and least frequently occurring protein bands, which would aid in typing K. pneumoniae isolates. To better understand the differences between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive K pneumoniae isolates, PCR-based genotyping techniques were the most effective approach. Protein profiles and antibiogram results provided further insights into the typing process. PCR-based genotyping methods are dependable resources for examining genetic connections among K. pneumoniae isolates, supplemented by insights from protein profiling to improve understanding of their epidemiological relevance and antibiotic resistance mechanisms in hospital environments.}

This study explores the factors influencing researchers' adoption of preprint publication, particularly the perceived effectiveness of this practice and research intensity indicators such as publication and review frequency. Using open data from a comprehensive survey with 5873 valid responses, we conducted regression analyses to control for demographic variables. Researchers' productivity, particularly the number of journal articles and books published, greatly influences the frequency of preprint deposits. The perception of the effectiveness of preprints follows this. Preprints are viewed positively in terms of early access to new research, but negatively in terms of early feedback. Demographic variables, such as gender and the type of organisation conducting the research, do not have a significant impact on the production of preprints when other factors are controlled for. However, the researcher's discipline, years of experience and geographical region generally have a moderate effect on the production of preprints. These findings highlight the motivations and barriers associated with preprint publication and provide insights into how researchers perceive the benefits and challenges of this practice within the broader context of open science.}

Mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET), the opposite of EMT, causes tumor metastasis. EMT drives primary tumor cells, whereas MET inhibits them. Importantly, the complex network of EMT includes cell–cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Transcription factors, post-translational regulation, cytokine-mediated signaling, and microRNAs control EMT. In this review, we discussed how molecular mechanisms, signaling networks, and epithelial/mesenchymal states affect cancer treatment resistance and the tumor microenvironment.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in various healthcare domains, but their effectiveness in identifying specific clinical conditions in real medical records is less explored. This study evaluates LLMs for detecting signs of cognitive decline in real electronic health record (EHR) clinical notes, comparing their error profiles with traditional models. The insights gained will inform strategies for performance enhancement.
Methods
This study, conducted at Mass General Brigham in Boston, MA, analysed clinical notes from the four years prior to a 2019 diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in patients aged 50 and older. We developed prompts for two LLMs, Llama 2 and GPT-4, on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant cloud-computing platforms using multiple approaches (e.g., hard prompting, retrieval augmented generation, and error analysis-based instructions) to select the optimal LLM-based method. Baseline models included a hierarchical attention-based neural network and XGBoost. Subsequently, we constructed an ensemble of the three models using a majority vote approach. Confusion-matrix-based scores were used for model evaluation.
Findings
We used a randomly annotated sample of 4949 note sections from 1969 patients (women: 1046 [53.1%]; age: mean, 76.0 [SD, 13.3] years), filtered with keywords related to cognitive functions, for model development. For testing, a random annotated sample of 1996 note sections from 1161 patients (women: 619 [53.3%]; age: mean, 76.5 [SD, 10.2] years) without keyword filtering was utilised. GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and efficiency compared to Llama 2, but did not outperform traditional models. The ensemble model outperformed the individual models in terms of all evaluation metrics with statistical significance (p < 0.01), achieving a precision of 90.2% [95% CI: 81.9%–96.8%], a recall of 94.2% [95% CI: 87.9%–98.7%], and an F1-score of 92.1% [95% CI: 86.8%–96.4%]. Notably, the ensemble model showed a significant improvement in precision, increasing from a range of 70%–79% to above 90%, compared to the best-performing single model. Error analysis revealed that 63 samples were incorrectly predicted by at least one model; however, only 2 cases (3.2%) were mutual errors across all models, indicating diverse error profiles among them.
Interpretation
LLMs and traditional machine learning models trained using local EHR data exhibited diverse error profiles. The ensemble of these models was found to be complementary, enhancing diagnostic performance. Future research should investigate integrating LLMs with smaller, localised models and incorporating medical data and domain knowledge to enhance performance on specific tasks.

Traditional methods for estimating this response often rely on experimental tests or numerical simulations, which are labor-intensive, costly, and sometimes unstable. This study presents HysGAN-RC, a conditional generative adversarial network model developed to predict the hysteretic behavior of RC columns. The model was trained using 258 hysteretic loops of RC column specimens encompassing flexure, flexure-shear, and shear failure modes. By incorporating the Wasserstein distance with a gradient penalty, HysGAN-RC improves the baseline CGAN performance. The model’s effectiveness was evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metrics under various conditions. Numerical experiments show that HysGAN-RC achieves a mean IoU of 0.68 and an FID of 7.2 when utilizing ten RC design parameters, including geometric, material, and reinforcement details. The model’s performance is further supported by a mean Structural Similarity Index of 0.90, indicating strong agreement between generated and real hysteretic curves in both visual shape and mechanical behavior. Notably, HysGAN-RC can predict hysteretic shapes across varying design conditions without requiring prior knowledge of the failure type, positioning it as a promising tool for high-fidelity seismic assessment of RC columns.}

The preclinical abuse potential assessments for HSK21542 included the following studies: 1) intravenous self-administration study to explore the relative reinforcing efficacy in rats self-administering remifentanil; 2) rat drug discrimination study to examine the pharmacological similarity of the interoceptive or subjective effects of HSK21542 in rats discriminating pentazocine; 3) rat conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm to test the rewarding effects; 4) rat natural physical dependence-spontaneous withdrawal study in rats chronically treated with HSK21542; 5) naloxone-precipitated withdrawal assay following chronic HSK21542 exposure to evaluate its physical dependence potential. The results showed that HSK21542 was devoid of behavioral evidence of positive reinforcing effect and did not share similar discriminative stimulus effects with pentazocine. HSK21542 also did not produce CPP in rats. In addition, HSK21542 did not produce spontaneous withdrawal or naloxone-precipitated withdrawal in rats with chronic treatments. Collectively, these preclinical findings suggest that HSK21542 has no abuse potential in animals, which demonstrate low abuse potential in humans.}

South Korean undergraduate L2 students were asked to engage in two chatbot-based linguistic tasks and complete a survey regarding their perceptions of LLM-based TOD chatbots. The results showed that the utterances generated by these state-of-the-art chatbots were perceived as very natural, and they were found to be highly capable of understanding dialogues in context and keeping track of the progress of the conversation to produce contextually appropriate responses to the user’s input.

abstract = {Obesity rates are increasing globally, and food addiction (FA1) may be an important contributing factor but there is a lack of understanding of the key psychological mechanisms that contribute to FA. The bioSocial Cognitive Theory (bSCT) proposes that substance use is predicted by biologically based personality traits and their influence on social cognitive mechanisms. While validated in substance use, bSCT has not been applied to a behavioural or non-substance addiction. However, the bSCT does not include a negative affective personality component, of which there is clear theoretical and empirical support as risk factors for FA. Thus, this study sought to test both the original bSCT model and an elaborated version related to eating (bSCT-e) that included direct and indirect punishment sensitivity pathways to identify the individual risk factors of FA. Data were collected from 204 university students (75.5% female; Mage = 24.82, SD = 9.17) via an online survey. Both original bSCT and bSCT-e models provided a good fit to the data, with the latter providing slightly better fit and accounting for more variance in FA. The findings suggest that individuals who are more reward driven and punishment sensitive hold exaggerated beliefs about the reinforcing and emotion regulation effects of eating, which may undermine eating control and increase risk of FA. This study provides potential new insights into the complex biopsychosocial mechanisms of FA, and points to potential intervention targets.}

abstract = {Objectives
To systematically evaluate the performance of COVID-19 prognostic models and scores for mortality risk in older populations across three health-care settings: hospitals, primary care, and nursing homes.
Study Design and Setting
This retrospective external validation study included 14,092 older individuals of ≥70 years of age with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 2020 to December 2020. The six validation cohorts include three hospital-based (CliniCo, COVID-OLD, COVID-PREDICT), two primary care-based (Julius General Practitioners Network/Academisch network huisartsgeneeskunde/Network of Academic general Practitioners, PHARMO), and one nursing home cohort (YSIS) in the Netherlands. Based on a living systematic review of COVID-19 prediction models using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool for quality and risk of bias assessment and considering predictor availability in validation cohorts, we selected six prognostic models predicting mortality risk in adults with COVID-19 infection (GAL-COVID-19 mortality, 4C Mortality Score, National Early Warning Score 2-extended model, Xie model, Wang clinical model, and CURB65 score). All six prognostic models were validated in the hospital cohorts and the GAL-COVID-19 mortality model was validated in all three healthcare settings. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home settings. Model performance was evaluated in each validation cohort separately in terms of discrimination, calibration, and decision curves. An intercept update was performed in models indicating miscalibration followed by predictive performance re-evaluation.
Main Outcome Measure
In-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home setting.
Results
All six prognostic models performed poorly and showed miscalibration in the older population cohorts. In the hospital settings, model performance ranged from calibration-in-the-large −1.45 to 7.46, calibration slopes 0.24–0.81, and C-statistic 0.55–0.71 with 4C Mortality Score performing as the most discriminative and well-calibrated model. Performance across health-care settings was similar for the GAL-COVID-19 model, with a calibration-in-the-large in the range of −2.35 to −0.15 indicating overestimation, calibration slopes of 0.24–0.81 indicating signs of overfitting, and C-statistic of 0.55–0.71.
Conclusion
Our results show that most prognostic models for predicting mortality risk performed poorly in the older population with COVID-19, in each health-care setting: hospital, primary care, and nursing home settings. Insights into factors influencing predictive model performance in the older population are needed for pandemic preparedness and reliable prognostication of health-related outcomes in this demographic.}

abstract = {Objectives
Motor imagery (MI) practice has shown substantial benefits on force, but this was mostly demonstrated on force produced by isometric contractions in laboratory settings. Here, we tested a new type of MI intervention to improve force and power in expert athletes.
Design
CrossFit® athletes (n = 100) of national level were randomly assigned to experimental groups who completed a 5-week back squat training program (3 resistance training sessions/week, ~1 h per week). A first group (n = 35) received instructions to perform kinesthetic MI of the concentric phase of the back squat concomitant to its physical execution (MICONCENTRIC). A second group (n = 35) performed kinesthetic MI of the eccentric phase concomitant to its physical execution (MECCENTRIC). A control group (n = 30) completed the same amount of physical training without engaging in MI (Control).
Methods
Performance was indexed from the 5 repetition maximum (5 RM) squat workload before and after the intervention. Weekly, we assessed squat power using an accelerometer.
Results
MICONCENTRIC and MIECCENTRIC groups outperformed Control regarding pretest vs. posttest improvements in both 5 RM force and power (RP2 = 0.60, both p < 0.001). The MIECCENTRIC group also outperformed the MICONCENTRIC group for the 5 RM workload (RP2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). However, subjective evaluations revealed that athletes in the MIECCENTRIC group experienced higher effort perception and difficulty to complete the experimental task.
Conclusions
MI practice concomitant to physical training was efficient to improve force on a dynamic multi-joint exercise in expert athletes.}

abstract = {Generating realistic synthetic tabular data is a crucial task for privacy-preserving data sharing, data augmentation, and learning from limited samples. However, existing methods often struggle with small sample sizes, heterogeneous feature types, and generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose TabularMDLM, a novel diffusion-based generative framework that integrates masked language modeling to synthesize high-quality tabular data. Unlike prior work, TabularMDLM applies noise only to feature values—preserving the semantic relationship between column names and values—and leverages pre-trained language models to iteratively reconstruct masked tokens during reverse diffusion. This design enhances generation quality while ensuring structural consistency. To evaluate the framework, we conduct extensive experiments on six tabular datasets of varying sizes, domains, and feature types. We compare TabularMDLM against recent baselines, including TabDDPM, CTGAN, and CTGAN+, under a privacy-conscious setting where only synthetic data is used for training and real data for testing. We also assess performance under class imbalance to validate generalization. Results show that TabularMDLM achieves consistently strong classification performance across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, outperforming baselines in both balanced and imbalanced settings. In contrast to existing methods, TabularMDLM scales to diverse data types and low-resource regimes, offering practical advantages in privacy-sensitive applications.}

We examined how this connectedness predicted lecturers’ self-efficacy in online teaching. This was in addition to other social context variables (connectedness with colleagues and perceived support from the university) and their previous experience with digital tools. The shift to online teaching in the lockdown period abruptly removed any in-person contact between lecturers and their students. Lecturers’ self-efficacy in online teaching is crucial to student motivation, achievement, and the lecturer's own teaching experience. Likewise, lecturers’ connectedness with students and colleagues has been identified as a key factor in learning. Consequently, this study explored how different forms of connectedness predicted lecturers’ self-efficacy in the new teaching environment. A total of 252 lecturers from UK and Swiss universities completed an online survey about their teaching experiences before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Multiple regressions were used to predict lecturers’ online teaching self-efficacy. The results revealed that connectedness with students was a significant and positive predictor of online teaching self-efficacy. However, connectedness with colleagues and perceived support from the university did not. The perception that digital tools enhanced teaching prior to the lockdown was a significant predictor only for the UK lecturers, but not for the Swiss ones. These findings point towards lecturers’ connectedness with their students being a pathway to success in online teaching.}

abstract = {Context:
Utilizing pretrained language models (PLMs) has become common practice in maintaining the content quality of question-answering (Q&A) websites. However, evaluating the effectiveness of PLMs poses a challenge as they tend to provide local optima rather than global optima.
Objective:
In this study, we propose using semantic-preserving Metamorphic Relations (MRs) derived from Metamorphic Testing (MT) to address this challenge and validate PLMs.
Methods:
To validate four selected PLMs, we conducted an empirical experiment using a publicly available dataset comprising 60000 data points. We defined three groups of Metamorphic Relations (MRGs), consisting of thirteen semantic-preserving MRs, which were then employed to generate “Follow-up” testing datasets based on the original “Source” testing datasets. The PLMs were trained using a separate training dataset. A comparison was made between the predictions of the four trained PLMs for “Source” and “Follow-up” testing datasets in order to identify instances of violations, which corresponded to inconsistent predictions between the two datasets. If no violation was found, it indicated that the PLM was insensitive to the associate MR; thereby, the MR can be used for validation. In cases where no violation occurred across the entire MRG, non-violation regions were identified and supported simulation metamorphic testing.
Results:
The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed MRs could effectively serve as a validation tool for content quality classification on Stack Overflow Q&A using PLMs. One PLM did not violate the “Uppercase conversion” MRG and the “Duplication” MRG. Furthermore, the absence of violations in the MRGs allowed for the identification of non-violation regions, confirming the ability of the proposed MRs to support simulation metamorphic testing.
Conclusion:
The experimental findings indicate that the proposed MRs can validate PLMs effectively and support simulation metamorphic testing for PLMs. However, further investigations are required to enhance the semantic comprehension and common sense knowledge of PLMs and explore highly informative statistical patterns of PLMs, in order to improve their overall performance.}

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been increasingly applied to enhance the audio quality and reduce the bit rate. However, applying models with high computational complexity to IoT terminals is difficult. In this study, we propose a voice-services-over NTN solution including a novel 6G non-terrestrial and ground network integrated framework and a lightweight Large Models (LMs)-driven codec operating at 450 bits per second. We also designed a new voice packet header and deployed an agent on-ground gateway to reduce the bandwidth overhead. The non-standard Session Initiation Protocol header was converted to the standard format while re-encapsulating Internet Protocol and User Datagram Protocol headers, replacing the conventional implementations. Additionally, an operational NTN satellite was used to evaluate the proposed ReCodec. The experimental results demonstrate that the ReCodec decreases the computational complexity by 96.61% while increasing the voice quality by 17.55% when compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms. Furthermore, the design of the packet header reduced the voice frame header to 50 bytes.}

Real-time data is acquired from several legacy machine artifacts (such as seven-segment displays, toggle switches, and knobs), smart machines (such as 3D printers), and building data (such as sound sensors and temperature measurement devices) through MTConnect data streaming protocol. Further, a multi-agent LLM framework that consists of four specialized agents – a supervisor agent, a machine-expertise agent, a data visualization agent, and a fault-diagnostic agent is developed for context-specific manufacturing tasks. This LLM framework is then integrated into a digital twin to visualize the unstructured data in real time. The paper also explores how LLM-based digital twins can serve as real time virtual experts through an avatar, minimizing reliance on traditional manuals or supervisor-based expertise. To demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of this framework, we present a case study consisting of legacy machine artifacts and modern machines.

This article proposes a metamodern workflow for public relations, one that embraces uncertainty, pluralism, and relational ethics. Drawing on recent conceptual work, we position generative AI not as a solutionist tool for efficiency, but as a provocation: a mirror of our sociotechnical condition and a medium for speculative, stakeholder-centric practice. The proposed genAI enhanced ‘what if’ workflow replaces deterministic ‘if-then’ logic models with reflective, scenario-based approaches, embedding deliberative temporality, stakeholder co-creation, and ethical humility into communication planning. This shift from managerial instrumentalist to stakeholder-centric thinking reclaims public relations as a site of societal value—not in opposition to organizational strategy, but as its reimagined core. This, we argue, enables public relations practitioners to become curators of complexity and facilitators of communitas: cultivating shared meaning across difference, rather than smoothing it over. Furthermore, we explore how genAI can support—but not substitute—this role, modeling possible futures and mapping divergent stakeholder positions. This metamodern orientation does not resolve paradoxes but inhabits them, oscillating between pragmatism and idealism, structure and fluidity. It critiques the legacy of commercial democracy and managerial instrumentalism while offering an alternative: a relational, reflexive, and socially situated praxis of public relations. This article invites scholars and practitioners to reconceive public relations not as a promotional and persuasive function, but as an anticipatory and co-creative force for public and social value.}

Among Aeromonas species, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, A. veronii, and A. dhakensis are clinically important species that cause infections in humans, leading to diarrhea associated with gastroenteritis, necrotizing fasciitis, and sepsis. A. dhakensis is a newly established species that was reclassified in 2013, and it is considered more pathogenic than other Aeromonas species. However, accurate identification of Aeromonas species by biochemical characteristics, mass spectrometry, and 16S rRNA gene analysis can sometimes be difficult. In this study, 24 strains were classified into nine species by homology and phylogenetic analysis of the RNA polymerase B subunit gene (rpoB), the gold standard method for identifying Aeromonas species. The results of 16S rRNA gene analysis were consistent with those of rpoB analysis for all strains. The results of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were consistent with those of rpoB analysis for all strains excluding A. dhakensis; however, all five A. dhakensis strains were misidentified as other species. Therefore, we attempted to develop species-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR) for four pathogenic Aeromonas species. The results of these PCRs were completely consistent with those of rpoB gene analysis. These PCR-based methods can permit the identification of pathogenic Aeromonas species, especially A. dhakensis, more quickly and simply than conventional methods.}

In addition, the relationships between the SST anomaly (SSTA) and three climate index time series for the period 1982–2020 were investigated: the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. The spatiotemporal variability and climatology of the SST were studied by analyzing annual, seasonal, and monthly mean SST time series and climate fields. Relationships between the SSTA and climate index time series were investigated using Pearson's correlation analysis and wavelet coherence analysis. The annual mean SST time series shows a positive linear trend of about 0.027°C per year over the period 1982–2020. The spatial variability of the linear trend shows that the positive trend is consistent throughout the study area, ranging from 0.024 to 0.034°C per year. The spatial variability is not uniform, and high values of the trend are observed in the upper northwestern part and southwestern half of the basin. Seasonal mean SST fields show a positive North-South latitudinal gradient, with higher temperatures in the south, especially in the southwestern basin. In addition, the seasonal mean SST fields show possible coastal upwelling signatures along the coast of the Azores islands in different seasons. The results of Pearson's correlation analysis between basin-averaged, de-trended monthly mean SSTA and climate indices show that SSTA shows a significant positive correlation with SOI and a negative correlation with ONI from 1982 to 2020. NAO shows positive correlation with SSTA for the December-January-February season. Wavelet coherence analysis confirms significant coherences between the Azores SSTA and the climate-ocean indices at certain time scales and periods.}

abstract = {Background
Nucleolus complex-associated 4 homologue (NOC4L), a ribosome biogenesis factor essential for small subunit processome assembly, has demonstrated oncogenic potential across multiple malignancies. Nevertheless, the mechanistic contributions of NOC4L to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) pathogenesis remain poorly characterized. This study systematically investigates the expression, clinical relevance, and molecular functions of NOC4L in LUAD.
Methods
We analyzed RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD cohort and normal lung tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to quantify tumor-specific NOC4L expression. Functional enrichment analysis employing Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways revealed associations with ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional dysregulation. Single-cell RNA analysis were interrogated to identify cellular subpopulations with elevated NOC4L expression. Immune microenvironment alterations were evaluated using ssGSEA algorithms, while methylation aberrations were mapped via MethSurv. The STarBase database and prognostic model were utilized to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks regulating NOC4L. siRNA mediated NOC4L knockdown in A549 and H1299 LUAD cell lines was performed to assess phenotypic impacts through CCK-8 proliferation assays, colony formation analyses, and migration experiments.
Results
NOC4L exhibited significant overexpression in LUAD compared to normal tissues (P < 0.001), correlating with advanced TNM staging. Enrichment analysis indicated that NOC4L is associated with key pathways involved in cancer development. Single-cell analysis localized NOC4L overexpression predominantly within fibroblast subpopulations (c-9 cluster). High NOC4L expression correlated with immune microenvironment disorders, abnormal methylation levels, and mutations. Mechanistic studies identified the SNHG1/LINC00662-miR-101-3p axis as the predominant ceRNA regulator of NOC4L. Functional silencing of NOC4L significantly inhibited the proliferation, clone formation, and migration abilities of LUAD cells.
Conclusions
NOC4L as an oncogenic protein promotes the cancer progression related to immune infiltrates, which underscores that NOC4L is a promising diagnostic and prognostic marker that may facilitate targeted therapies in LUAD.}

A pivotal step in the development of such interventions involves translating theoretical intervention techniques into specific technological features. However, practical guidelines on how to approach this translation are currently underdeveloped. To support efforts to develop digital mental health interventions, from theoretical inception to an actual digital intervention, we present the Digital Intervention Development Guide (DID-Guide). The DID-Guide is structured into two distinct phases. Phase 1 establishes the intervention's theoretical foundation, outlining the steps for developing a theoretical intervention framework. Phase 2 translates this theoretical framework into actionable technological features, that make up the intervention. We break down the DID-Guide's two phases into a series of actionable steps, accompanied by concrete examples from a recent intervention that can be delivered through both a smartphone app and Virtual Reality. The DID-Guide serves as a comprehensive resource for creating impactful digital mental health interventions, while also facilitating collaboration and communication among a diverse range of stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and software developers.}

In this study, we investigated the toxicity of naphthalene on osteoblast function using osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Naphthalene at concentrations of 5–50 μM, which were low enough to not affect cell viability, effectively suppressed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and matrix mineralization in MG-63 cells. Moreover, naphthalene downregulated the expression of osteogenic markers, including runt-related transcription factor 2, Osterix, ALP, collagen type 1 alpha 1, and osteopontin, and phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The expression of β-catenin and its associated proteins was also suppressed following naphthalene treatment, leading to a reduction in nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Naphthalene enhanced the intracellular reactive oxygen species level and suppressed nuclear expression of β-catenin signaling and its target molecules, including glycogen synthase kinase 3β, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, and these proteins were restored by treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Treatment with lithium chloride and MG132 confirmed that naphthalene-induced reactive oxygen species generation increased GSK3β activity, thereby promoting the proteasomal degradation of β-catenin and suppressing osteogenic activity in MG-63 cells. Interestingly, MG-63 cells cultured as spheroids exhibited enhanced osteogenic potential, providing a more physiologically relevant model. In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of naphthalene on osteogenic differentiation in MG-63 cells, as validated using a 3D spheroid model. Further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying naphthalene’s effects, particularly its role in the Wnt/β-catenin/GSK3β pathway, is needed.}

The results indicate that the Apology × Internal Attribution strategy is most effective in enhancing authenticity and tolerance. Mediation analysis revealed distinct psychological pathways, whereby in faithfulness hallucination, both authenticity and tolerance mediate continuance intention, whereas in factuality hallucination, only authenticity serves as a significant mediator. These findings suggest that AI providers should develop differentiated response strategies based on hallucination type, with internal attribution and explicit responsibility acknowledgment being crucial for maintaining user trust.}

abstract = {Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often leads to cognitive and neurological dysfunction. Valproic acid (VPA) has a neuroprotective effect in acute central nervous system diseases; the neurotrophin 3 gene (NT-3) can maintain the survival of neurons, and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) can promote the growth of nerve axons. This study aimed to evaluate the restorative effect of VPA combined with NT-3 modified OECs (NT-3-OECs) on neurological function after TBI.
Methods
The neurological severity score (NSS) of rats was evaluated on the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 28th day after TBI modeling and corresponding intervention. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, p75 nerve growth factor receptor (P75), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament protein (NF)staining, and argyrophilic staining were used to observe the morphology of brain tissue 28 days after modeling. Moreover, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect the apoptosis rate of neurons. The changes in synapses and mitochondria in the injured area were observed by electron microscope.
Results
NT-3-OECs transplantation can increase the content of NT-3 in brain tissue, and NT-3-OECs can survive for >28 days. The NSS score of the TBI-VPA-NT-3-OECs group 28 days after cell transplantation was significantly lower than that of the other model treatment groups (P < 0.05). The morphological structure of the brain tissue was more complete, and the neurofilament fibers were neatly arranged, achieving better results than those of the other groups. The apoptosis rate of nerve cells in the TBI-VPA-NT-3-OECs group was significantly lower than in the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of synapses in the combined intervention group was significantly higher than in the other treatment groups, and the mitochondrial structure was more complete.
Conclusion
NT-3-OECs have good biological function, and VPA combined with NT-3-OECs transplantation can effectively improve the prognosis of TBI rats.}

It was found that the optimized quenching temperature of the as-deposited steel specimen was 850℃, however that of the as-cast one was 800℃. The laths of martensite in the 850℃ quenched as-deposited steel specimen is apparently finer than that in the 800℃ quenched as-cast one. The two as-quenched steels at the optimized temperature above, compared with the other temperatures, exhibited the highest microhardness and the ultimate tensile strength (σuts). Additionally, much more dispersed carbides of Fe3C and Fe7C3 precipitated in the tempered martensite in the as-cast steel specimen after tempering treatments. The quenching at the optimized temperature of 850℃ led the as-deposited steel to have high σuts of 1179 MPa, however low total elongation (εtotal) of 14.3 %. In contrast, tempering at 180℃ for 2 h on the as-deposited steel specimen resulted in the lower σuts of 1161 MPa, however higher total elongation (εtotal) of 16.7 %.}

Interrogative, incidental recasts were provided by the researcher targeting lexical, morphological and syntactic features. In order to capture participants' attentional processes while reading the feedback, we used eye-tracking methodology and we employed Weblink software to generate measures showing number and length of fixations, duration of first fixation, and number of times learners returned to a target feature (interest area). For triangulation, we also conducted stimulated recall interviews so as to gain information about learners’ levels of noticing of target language areas. Both eye-tracking and stimulated recall interviews demonstrated greater levels of attention to lexical recasts than morphological and syntactic ones. In particular, lexical recasts led to more and longer fixations, and more returns to target features. The stimulated recall comments support this finding. Learners noticed target areas when lexical recasts were provided; whereas they perceived the majority of morphological and syntactic recasts as clarification requests or confirmation checks.}

In a preregistered 2x2 online experiment, participants from Austria, Denmark, France, and Serbia (Ntotal = 1951) encountered written scenarios about their health that manipulated disease threat (low vs. high) and stigma (low vs. high). The sample was stratified to ensure representativeness for age, gender, and educational level across the countries studied. Results showed no main effect of disease threat on AI information-seeking intentions, but stigma significantly influenced preferences, particularly in mild health conditions. Participants were more likely to consult AI over peers for stigmatized conditions, highlighting the role of AI's anonymous interface in reducing social judgment. Country differences further revealed that national contexts also shape AI adoption: while participants in Denmark and France showed a stronger preference for AI over peers, those in Serbia and Austria preferred peers over AI. Additionally, AI trust and literacy emerged as the strongest predictors of both AI usage intentions and preferences. These findings indicate that gen AI tools can play a complementary role in the health information ecosystem, particularly for stigmatized conditions and in contexts where traditional sources are perceived as less accessible or judgment-free.}

Based on an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) with task relevance, subjective norm, and perceived enjoyment being added, quantitative data were collected from 140 Chinese EFL learners. Structural equation modeling analysis suggested that the proposed model could effectively explain participants’ views of Grammarly. Their perceptions of ease of use significantly influenced usefulness, which had a major impact on their attitudes towards AI and behavioral intention. Perceived enjoyment and task relevance were also significant predictors of students’ perceptions of this software. The research model explained 71% of the variance of EFL learners’ intentions to use AI. Suggestions were given to teachers on implementing AI writing support.}

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the completeness and quality of open peer review reports from BMC journals for regression-based clinical prediction model studies in oncology, focusing on adherence to methodological standards, reporting guidelines, and constructive feedback.
Methods
We searched for published prediction model studies in the field of oncology, published in BioMed Central journals in 2021. Data extraction used the ARCADIA checklist (13-item tool assessing review quality) with additional criteria (e.g., word count, focus of comments on manuscript sections). Two investigators independently evaluated all open peer reviews, with conflicts resolved involving a third researcher. Descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis were applied.
Results
Peer reviews were brief (median: 243 words; range: 0–677), with 82.7% focusing on methods or results but rarely addressing limitations (<20%) or generalisability. No reviewers verified adherence to reporting guidelines (e.g., TRIPOD); only one mentioned guideline use. Reviews prioritised superficial issues (67.3% focused on presentation) over methodological rigor (38.5% evaluated statistical methods). There are 19.2% suggested statistical revisions, and <1% addressed protocol deviations or data availability.
Conclusions
Our findings show that peer reviews of prediction models lack depth, methodological scrutiny, and enforcement of reporting standards. This risks clinical harm from biased models and perpetuates research waste. Reforms are urgently needed, including implementing reporting guidelines (e.g., TRIPOD+AI), mandatory reviewer training, and recognition of peer review as scholarly labour. Journals must prioritise methodological rigor in reviews to ensure reliable prediction models and safeguard patient care.}

abstract = {Background
The recent unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak in Saudi Arabia necessitated an assessment of healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP). This study assessed healthcare workers' knowledge regarding the transmission, contagiousness, presentation, and diagnosis of foodborne botulism, as well as their management practices, including contacting public health authorities, administering antitoxin, preparedness to respond to botulism cases and consulting generative Artificial Intelligent (AI)-chatbots, like ChatGPT.
Methods
A cross-sectional online survey targeting Saudi HCWs was conducted from May 6–19, 2024, following the first foodborne botulism outbreak. The survey, developed by infectious disease and public health experts according to the Saudi Public Health Authority (SPHA) botulism guidelines, covered several sections: demographics, knowledge about foodborne botulism, attitudes and perceptions, intended practices, and worry level. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, multivariable linear regression to assess factors influencing knowledge, and multivariable logistic binary regression to evaluate factors affecting confidence in handling botulism.
Results
Among the 1058 participants, the knowledge score was 9.69/20 (48.4 % correct ± 18 %), with higher scores among HCWs working in tertiary centers, older than 34 years, reading SPHA botulism protocol, and using scientific journals as main information sources. HCWs consulting ChatGPT had significantly lower knowledge scores (p-value < 0.001). HCWs displayed highly intended practices in managing botulism, with a mean score of 4.10/5. The self-rated management confidence was moderate (2.84 ± 1.05 out of 5-points). Multivariable logistic binary regression showed that previous experience with botulism and reading SPHA protocol were the most significant factors associated with a higher management confidence.
Conclusions
This study highlights significant HCWs’ knowledge gaps during unprecedented foodborne botulism outbreak. Previous experience with botulism cases and reading recent guidelines were associated with higher knowledge and confidence, while reliance on ChatGPT was linked to lower scores. This study emphasizes the importance of timely publishing local guidelines to favorably affect both knowledge and confidence to deal with infectious outbreaks. Future research should evaluate long-term effectiveness of educational interventions.}

abstract = {This study introduces a novel, automated methodology for extracting urban building typologies from digital land cadastres using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Unlike traditional shape clustering approaches, that depend on predefined rules or manual labelling, the method employs unsupervised learning to identify building typologies, based solely on geometric features, derived from roof-print shapes. Leveraging a large-scale dataset of over 100,000 buildings from the Seville, Spain cadastre, the VAE has been trained with augmented data to generate a latent space that captures dominant morphological patterns. The analysis has revealed 24 to 26 distinct building typologies, encompassing both prevalent and rare urban forms. The approach effectively filters out non-representative shapes and is scalable for application across entire cities. By automatically identifying representative building shapes, the method facilitates the creation of parametric structural models, which are essential for developing machine learning tools to predict seismic damage. This replicable and automated strategy significantly reduces the time and resources required for typology-based seismic vulnerability assessments, providing valuable support for civil protection agencies and urban planners.}

Health equity is a concept that has gained increasing attention and relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed and exacerbated the health disparities and inequities among different population groups in the United States. This article aims to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the historical, theoretical, and empirical foundations of health equity, as well as the challenges and opportunities for advancing it in the modern US society. By adopting an interdisciplinary and intersectional approach, and by drawing on literature from public health, sociology, economics, and human rights, we argue that health equity is not only a matter of fairness and justice, but also a strategic and pragmatic goal for improving the health and well-being of the entire nation. Here, we propose a modern definition of health equity for the US context, and conclude with some recommendations for policy, practice, and research to promote health equity in the US}

abstract = {Introduction
Persons with disabilities still face numerous barriers in their everyday lives, especially in transportation. The problem of access to transportation is identified through fewer daily trips and more barriers in public transport. These problems indicate transportation equity issues among persons with disabilities. Another issue recognized in previous studies was a gender imbalance in the samples that could indicate gender equality problems among persons with disabilities. This paper aims to investigate mobility and accessibility indicators among persons with disabilities, with a particular emphasis on the impact of gender, in order to explore two critical transportation equity issues: inclusivity and social justice.
Methods
The mobility and accessibility indicators analyzed in this research were the Number of daily trips, Mobility satisfaction, Infrastructure accessibility satisfaction, and Modal distributions of daily trips. The data about indicators was collected by an online version of a questionnaire. The research was performed on 100 persons with disabilities from Serbia, equally distributed by gender. The most common recorded diagnosis of the respondents was spinal cord injury.
Results
In general, respondents made 3.26 trips per day. At two transportation modes, we identified significant differences between males and females. Males frequently tripped as passenger car drivers, and females often traveled as passengers in passenger cars. Additionally, nine Bayesian linear regression models with weak informative prior distributions brought much helpful information.
Conclusions
The obtained results bring stakeholders valuable information in creating policies, practices, and recommendations to achieve specific goals related to transportation equity. Improving flexibility and time efficiency of females’ trips and resolving the problem of females’ fear of abuse and harassment in taxi cars were recognized as the two most critical topics.}

abstract = {Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy can enhance anti-tumor activity. This phase Ib clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cisplatin in combination with sintilimab and niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Methods
Patients with advanced solid tumors who had progressed after first-line or more lines of standard therapy were enrolled in the study, and received cisplatin and sintilimab on day 1 and niraparib from days 1–21 every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with sintilimab and niraparib (the same doses and schedules as before), until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicities. During the dose-escalation phase, patients were divided into three dose groups on the basis of a 3+3 dose-escalation regimen, and a dose-expansion phase was conducted based on the determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The primary endpoint was safety, including treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the secondary endpoint was efficacy. In addition, exploratory endpoints were prespecified to analyze potential biomarkers.
Results
From July 31, 2019, to July 1, 2022, a total of 26 patients were enrolled, and no DLTs were observed in the dose-escalation phase. The recommended RP2Ds of cisplatin, sintilimab, and niraparib were 60 mg/m2, 200 mg, and 100 mg every 3 weeks, respectively. All of the patients experienced varying degrees of TRAEs, and a 19.23% (5 patients) incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). With the median follow-up time of 47.9 months (95% CI: 38.8–NA), objective response rate was 26.92% (7 patients, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.57–47.79), disease control rate was 57.69% (15patients, 95% CI, 36.92–76.65), the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.30 months (95% CI, 2.14–4.46) and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.03 months (95% CI, 3.41–12.66), with PFS rates of 26.92% (seven patients) and 11.54% (three patients) at 6 and 12 months, and OS rates of 69.23%, 34.62% and 11.54% at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Patients with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression ≥1% showed significantly longer PFS (3.93 months, P = 0.032) and OS (14.97 months, P = 0.036) compared to those with PD-L1 expression <1%.
Conclusion
The combination of cisplatin with sintilimab and niraparib showed a manageable safety profile and modest anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Further validation in larger, histology-specific patients is needed to confirm clinical benefit. Trial registration: https://www.chictr.org.cn/; ID: ChiCTR1900024488}

As a propeptide, CgA is proteolytically cleaved to generate several peptides of biological importance, including pancreastatin (PST: hCgA250–301), Vasostatin 1 (VS1: hCgA1–76), and catestatin (CST: CgA 352–372). VS1 represents the most conserved fragment of CgA. A 20 amino acid domain within VS1 (CgA 47–66) exhibits potent antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Autism is known to be associated with inflammation. Therefore, we seek to test the hypothesis that VS1 modulates autism behaviors by reducing inflammation in the hippocampus. Treatment of C57BL/6 (B6) and BTBR (a mouse model of idiopathic autism) mice with VS1 revealed the following: BTBR mice showed a significant decrease in chamber time in the presence of a stranger or a novel object. Treatment with VS1 significantly increased chamber time in both cases, underscoring a crucial role for VS1 in improving behavioral deficits in BTBR mice. In contrast to chamber time, sniffing time in BTBR mice in the presence of a stranger was less compared to B6 control mice. VS1 did not improve this latter parameter. Surprisingly, sniffing time in BTBR mice in the presence of a novel object was comparable with B6 mice. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1b, as well as other inflammatory markers, were elevated in BTBR mice, which were dramatically reduced after supplementation with VS1. Interestingly, even Beclin-1/p62, pAKT/AKT, and p-p70-S6K/p70-S6K ratios were notably reduced by VS1. We conclude that VS1 plays a crucial role in restoring autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) plausibly by attenuating neuroinflammation.}

This study examines socioeconomic inequalities (SEI) in depression outcomes among people with HIV and/or diabetes who participated in a cluster randomised controlled trial in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The trial took place at 24 primary care clinics randomised to deliver a task-shared psychological intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). The trial enrolled 1119 participants meeting criteria for probable depression. Depression symptom severity was evaluated at baseline and 24-month follow-up. Using a concentration index (CI), SEIs in depression were assessed for the intervention and TAU arms. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were used to decompose the CI to identify contributors to SEI. Results indicate poorer participants at the intervention arm have significantly worse 24-month outcomes than wealthier counterparts (CI = – 0.080; SE = 0.025). Race (34.2%), unemployment (17.4%) and food insecurity (15%) were the main contributing factors. While policymakers need to invest in psychological interventions to reduce the burden caused by depression, this study suggests treatment outcomes may be different across the socioeconomic spectrum. Decomposition of these findings points to structural constraints, such as unemployment, as the key contributors towards poorer treatment outcomes. These findings suggest a need to combine psychological interventions with structural interventions that address the broader socio-economic determinants of mental health.}

abstract = {Background
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major public health concern and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, challenges remain in deploying effective screening strategies for early-stage CRC. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a fecal-based syndecan-2 (SDC2) methylation test for the detection of colorectal lesions and CRC.
Methods
We retrospectively collected data on participants who underwent fecal SDC2 methylation testing from January 1, 2019, to May 30, 2023. Patients with positive results were recommended to undergo colonoscopy. Performance indicators associated with certain clinical characteristics, including positive rate (PR), positive predictive value (PPV), and colonoscopy compliance rate (CCR), were subjected to statistical analysis.
Results
We analyzed data from 113,209 participants, of whom 11,841 (10.4% PR) had positive fecal SDC2 methylation test results. A total of 4315 participants with positive results adhered to the colonoscopy recommendations, and the CCR was 36.4%. Finally, 3169 colorectal lesions were detected, including 1134 polyps, 875 non-advanced adenomas (NAAs), 770 advanced adenomas (AAs), and 390 CRCs, with PPV values of 26.3% (1134/4315), 20.3% (875/4315), 17.8% (770/4315), and 9.0% (390/4315), respectively. Notably, the PPV for CRC increased significantly with age (χ2 = 164.40, P < 0.0001). In addition, as the cycle threshold (CT) values increased, the PPVs of AAs and CRCs generally decreased, whereas those of NAAs and polyps significantly increased. Moreover, the clinical patient group had the highest incidence of late-stage CRC (stage II and higher), whereas asymptomatic populations from the staff physical examination group and rural town-based screening programs had the highest number of stage 0 and I CRCs detected (P = 0.0107).
Conclusions
This study indicates that fecal SDC2 methylation testing combined with colonoscopy may be an effective screening method for colorectal lesions and CRC.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia remains debated, and data from Mediterranean populations are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between AF and dementia in a large Catalan cohort, with a particular focus on identifying subgroups with the strongest associations.
Methods
We conducted a population-based observational study including individuals aged ≥45 years without prior diagnosis of dementia. Data were obtained from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care, which covers more than 80% of the Catalan population. Dementia was identified using ICD-10-CM codes and prescription records. Early-onset dementia (EOD) was defined as diagnosis before age 65 years. Participants were followed up from 2009 to 2021. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of incident dementia.
Results
A total of 2 520 839 individuals were included (mean follow-up: 13 years), of whom 79820 (3.25%) had AF at baseline. On univariate analysis, AF was a strong predictor of dementia (HR, 3.39; P<.001). However, after multivariable adjustment, the association was modest (HR, 1.04; P<.001). AF was a stronger independent predictor in individuals aged <70 years (HR, 1.21; P<.001), whereas the association was not significant in those aged ≥70. The strongest association was observed for EOD (HR, 1.36; P<.001). All associations remained consistent in analyses restricted to individuals without prior stroke.
Conclusions
In a large Mediterranean cohort, AF was independently associated with a modest increase in dementia risk, regardless of stroke. This association was stronger in younger individuals and in EOD. These findings highlight the need for studies assessing the impact of early identification and management of AF on dementia incidence in younger populations.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La relación entre fibrilación auricular (FA) y demencia es controvertida y hay datos limitados en la población mediterránea. Se evaluó la asociación entre FA y demencia en Cataluña, intentando identificar subgrupos de mayor riesgo.
Métodos
Estudio observacional poblacional que incluyó a individuos ≥45 años sin demencia. Los datos se obtuvieron del Sistema de Información para el Desarrollo de la Investigación en Atención Primaria, que cubre más del 80% de la población catalana. La demencia se identificó mediante códigos CIE-10-MC y datos de prescripción farmacológica. Se definió como demencia de inicio temprano (DIT) aquella diagnosticada antes de los 65 años. El seguimiento fue desde 2009 hasta 2021. Los predictores de demencia se evaluaron mediante modelos de regresión de Cox.
Resultados
Se incluyó a 2.520.839 participantes (seguimiento medio de 13 años); 79.820 (3,25%) tenían FA basalmente. La FA fue predictor univariante de demencia (HR=3,39; p<0,001), pero el análisis multivariante reveló una asociación modesta (HR=1,04; p<0,001). La FA fue un predictor independiente más potente en <70 años (HR=1,21; p<0,001) y la asociación fue máxima en DIT (HR=1,36; p<0,001). En cambio, la asociación FA-demencia perdió significación en ≥70 años. Los resultados fueron similares censurando por ictus.
Conclusiones
En una gran cohorte mediterránea, la FA se asoció de forma independiente con un aumento moderado del riesgo de demencia, independientemente del ictus. Esta asociación fue más fuerte en individuos más jóvenes y en DIT. Estos hallazgos subrayan la necesidad de realizar estudios que evalúen el impacto de la identificación y el tratamiento precoz de la FA en la incidencia de la demencia en pacientes jóvenes.}

abstract = {Bulk oxide polishing occupies a substantial portion of time to achieve surface planarization in semiconductor manufacturing. Recently, thermal management has emerged as a critical issue in the polishing process. Fundamental research on thermal effects in oxide film polishing is essential for optimizing both the thermal management system and the polishing process itself. Experiments indicate that friction force, significantly influenced by wafer and retainer ring pressures as well as slurry species, plays a major role in determining polishing temperature, more so than slurry flow rate. An important finding is the temperature-dependent behavior of slurry particles, which generally reduce in size and concentrate more at higher temperatures, with aggregation starting at around 80 °C. High-temperature slurry deteriorated pad properties but enhance oxide film surface hydrolyzation. During a 60-s polishing process, the slurry temperature exhibited the maximum removal rate at 60 °C for fumed silica polishing, while for calcined ceria, the highest removal rate was observed at 20 °C. Pad B at ambient temperature, having similar hardness to Pad A at 60 °C, reduced the oxide film removal rate by 31.82 % for fumed silica and 40.94 % for calcined ceria. This indicates that pad hardness has a more pronounced effect on polishing with calcined ceria slurry.}

abstract = {Purpose
To provide a proof-of-concept analysis of the appropriateness and performance of ChatGPT-4 to triage, synthesize differential diagnoses, and generate treatment plans concerning common presentations of knee pain.
Methods
Twenty knee complaints warranting triage and expanded scenarios were input into ChatGPT-4, with memory cleared prior to each new input to mitigate bias. For the 10 triage complaints, ChatGPT-4 was asked to generate a differential diagnosis that was graded for accuracy and suitability in comparison to a differential created by 2 orthopaedic sports medicine physicians. For the 10 clinical scenarios, ChatGPT-4 was prompted to provide treatment guidance for the patient, which was again graded. To test the higher-order capabilities of ChatGPT-4, further inquiry into these specific management recommendations was performed and graded.
Results
All ChatGPT-4 diagnoses were deemed appropriate within the spectrum of potential pathologies on a differential. The top diagnosis on the differential was identical between surgeons and ChatGPT-4 for 70% of scenarios, and the top diagnosis provided by the surgeon appeared as either the first or second diagnosis in 90% of scenarios. Overall, 16 of 30 diagnoses (53.3%) in the differential were identical. When provided with 10 expanded vignettes with a single diagnosis, the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 increased to 100%, with the suitability of management graded as appropriate in 90% of cases. Specific information pertaining to conservative management, surgical approaches, and related treatments was appropriate and accurate in 100% of cases.
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 provided clinically reasonable diagnoses to triage patient complaints of knee pain due to various underlying conditions that were generally consistent with differentials provided by sports medicine physicians. Diagnostic performance was enhanced when providing additional information, allowing ChatGPT-4 to reach high predictive accuracy for recommendations concerning management and treatment options. However, ChatGPT-4 may show clinically important error rates for diagnosis depending on prompting strategy and information provided; therefore, further refinements are necessary prior to implementation into clinical workflows.
Clinical Relevance
Although ChatGPT-4 is increasingly being used by patients for health information, the potential for ChatGPT-4 to serve as a clinical support tool is unclear. In this study, we found that ChatGPT-4 was frequently able to diagnose and triage knee complaints appropriately as rated by sports medicine surgeons, suggesting that it may eventually be a useful clinical support tool.}

abstract = {Fatigue of materials stands as a prevalent cause of mechanical structure failures, which often occur suddenly, unpredictably, and catastrophically. Accurately predicting the fatigue lifespan of materials is crucial, especially given the potential for fatigue failure to occur within a short design life. While traditional methodologies based on S-N curve models remain prevalent in industry, there is a contemporary shift towards employing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to significantly refine the accuracy of fatigue lifetime predictions. In this study, a dataset containing experimental data from various structural steels is used. Through preprocessing and feature selection, four techniques are explored: Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGB Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), aiming to identify the most effective algorithm. The implementation of these methodologies for fatigue lifetime prediction yields substantial outcomes. All models exhibit satisfactory performance, with XGB Regression demonstrating superior effectiveness. Furthermore, Polynomial Regression provides highly satisfactory results, almost identical to the Artificial Neural Network. Notably, it requires significantly less computational power, making it a practical alternative in cases of restricted computational resources or limited implementation time. Overall, the proposed methodology effectively leverages material preprocessing details, mechanical properties and experimental conditions to provide accurate predictions of the remaining fatigue lifespan of structural steels.}

The receptor tyrosine kinase Kit is expressed in cells derived from the trunk neural crest (NC), such as melanocytes; however, its role in cranial NC cell development is not fully understood.
Methods
We investigated the effects of the heterozygous loss of Kit in NC cells during embryonic development by mating Kit2lox/+ mice with Wnt1-Cre mice to produce Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ embryos. In addition, Wnt1-Cre mice were mated with Rosa26R-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mice to visualize the tissue regions expressing Cre recombinase. Histological studies of the craniofacial regions of these mice were performed using samples from embryonic day (E) 12.5 and postnatal day (P) 1. Cellular apoptosis and proliferation were both analyzed through the immunostaining of tissue sections collected on E13.5 and E14.5 using anti-cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) to detect apoptosis and anti-Ki67 to detect proliferation. Cells from YFP-positive tissue regions of the facial areas of Wnt1-Cre; Kit+/+; Rosa26R–YFP embryos and Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+; Rosa26R–YFP embryos collected on E12.5 and E15.5 were cultured and evaluated for cell proliferation.
Results
Compared with control littermates, Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ embryos exhibited midline cleft lip and bifid nose deformities. Substantial early (P1) postnatal lethality was observed in Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ mice, with none surviving to 3 weeks of age. YFP-positive cells from the maxillary regions of Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+; Rosa26R–YFP embryos exhibited defective cell growth and self-renewal in vitro.
Conclusion
Conditional heterozygous loss of Kit in Wnt1-Cre; Kit2lox/+ embryos is associated with craniofacial dysplasia and exhibit defective NC development in vitro and in vivo.}

As a consequence, it was impossible to mathematically model individual-based mechanisms of direct and indirect competition, which hampers the understanding of ecological dynamics. To overcome this problem, we developed a fully transparent mechanistic analog of the classical Lotka-Volterra phenomenological model based on explicitly explainable artificial intelligence (AI) of the glass-box type. In this paper, on an individual-based model, we present (i) a rigorous mechanism of inverted competitive exclusion where, all else being equal, the weaker species in direct competition defeats the stronger species through indirect exploitative competition and (ii) a rigorous mechanism of coexistence of complete competitors resulting from a combination of accounting for microhabitat regeneration, moderate reproduction, a certain habitat size and boundary conditions. Both presented mechanisms go beyond the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, as in our model two species with different competitiveness compete for a single limiting resource in one homogeneous bounded ecosystem. We have shown that individual-based modeling of direct and indirect competition mechanisms allows for a more detailed understanding of the causal mechanisms of interspecific competition. Such understanding is necessary to refine formulations of the competitive exclusion principle, to search for mechanisms of competitive coexistence, to predict ecosystem behavior, and to develop conservation strategies. Our approach allows us to study discrete systems with fundamentally discrete mathematics, which opens up new opportunities for achieving accuracy, clarity, rigor, and explainability in studies of complex systems.}

abstract = {When applying blockchain sharding technology in the building Internet of Things (IoT) domain to enhance the throughput performance of the blockchain, cross-shard transactions triggered by device collaborative tasks have increasingly become a prominent issue. Existing solutions base their shard division on historical transaction moments, using the outcomes for future transaction processing. However, since the historical interaction characteristics do not accurately reflect the interaction details within specific fine-grained time periods, this leads to poor system performance. Additionally, the parameter configuration in blockchain sharding systems is mostly based on arbitrary or default settings, which also results in unstable system performance. To address these two challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain sharding scheme called AI-Shard. Firstly, the system includes a module, G-AI, that utilizes generative AI to predict future node interaction relationships, enabling more proactive and adaptive shard division based on the predicted interaction matrix. Secondly, the system integrates a reinforcement learning module, DL-AI, specifically tailored for configuring parameters of the blockchain sharding system, such as the number of shards, block size, and block interval, to automatically optimize them, aiming to further enhance the system's throughput. Experimental results show that AI-Shard can reduce the proportion of cross-shard transactions and improve the system's throughput.}

abstract = {Objectives
Aging-associated body composition changes lead to a decrease in muscle mass and strength, affecting the functionality of older adults. Myostatin and musclin are myokines that regulate muscle metabolism and may modulate muscle changes during aging. Our objective was to determine the relationship between myostatin, musclin, and nutritional status with physical functionality in older adults.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study of a subsample of a stratified random sampling population survey in community-dwelling 60–90-year-old adults of both sexes. Serum myostatin and musclin concentrations were measured using MILLIPLEX technology (Merck Millipore, USA). Trained personnel recorded body mass index (BMI), and waist (WC), calf (CC), and arm (AC) circumferences as indicators of nutritional status. Functionality tests included handgrip strength (GS), walking speed (WS), and Advanced Activities of Daily Living.
Results
Of 101 participants, 55.4% were women, 56.4% were between 60 and 69 years old, 53.5% had abdominal obesity, 23.8% had dynapenia, and 33.7% had low WS. Neither myostatin nor musclin showed significant changes from 60 to 90 years. In a multiple lineal regression model, myostatin showed an inverse correlation with BMI, CC, and AC in men (P < 0.05) but did not explain GS or WS. In a similar analysis, musclin and WC showed an inverse correlation with GS (P < 0.05). Moreover, myostatin was lower in the more physically active men (P < 0.05) but musclin did not show any relationship with the Advanced Activities of Daily Living scale.
Conclusions
Myostatin and musclin do not decrease with aging and are associated with nutritional and metabolic status. Musclin is associated with dynapenic obesity in older adults.}

We report a preregistered within-subjects survey experiment with a representative German sample (n = 1850) testing how information about AI-facilitated deliberation affects willingness to participate and expected quality. Respondents were randomly assigned to descriptions of identical deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or humans, enabling causal identification of information effects. Results show a clear AI penalty: participants were less willing to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and anticipated lower deliberative quality than for human-facilitated formats. The penalty shrank among respondents who perceived greater societal benefits of AI or tended to anthropomorphize it, but grew with higher assessments of AI risk. These findings indicate that AI-facilitated deliberation currently faces substantial public skepticism and may create a new “deliberative divide.” Unlike traditional participation gaps linked to education or demographics, this divide reflects attitudes toward AI. Efforts to realize AI's affordances should directly address these perceptions to offset the penalty and avoid discouraging participation or exacerbating participatory inequalities.}

Because of being limited by the known and inherent features, KE can only generate a limited number of new modeling without providing a rich source of creativity. To get rid of the shackles of inherent characteristics, KE and Association Creative Thinking Method (ACTM) are combined in this paper to stimulate the bionic design creativity. The creativity of bionic design comes from the association of highly ordered Kansei vocabulary, and the product form derived from this can significantly enhance emotional value and user satisfaction. The electronic scale is taken as an example and the research is divided into three stages. Firstly, samples and Kansei words are widely selected; the priority order of each Kansei word is obtained after continuous fuzzy Kano model analysis. Secondly, after morphological analysis deconstructs product features, support vector regression establishes an engineering model between the highest-ranking Kansei words and products’ form features so as to generate the optimal product design. Finally, after six operational steps of ACTM, a series of biologically inspired creative designs are obtained. The research results found that: 1. Customers ranked their Kansei needs for electronic scales in order of cute, fashionable, and elegant. 2. The circular appearance, square screen, U-shaped mechanical key and other styling components can easily trigger customers’ cute emotional needs. 3. The biomimetic design of fish tail, cat paw, and octopus style meets the Kansei needs of customers and provides parameter guidance for manufacturers. Compared to traditional KE, which only obtains the optimal design combination for morphological analysis table, combining ACTM’s biomimetic inspired design makes creative shapes more vivid and interesting, improving market sales and the success rate of new product development.}

Anticancer researchers have identified peptide-based CXCR4 antagonists as promising candidates due to their high targeting specificity and favorable safety profiles.. This review provides an analytical examination of CXCR4 antagonistic peptides,the selective Mavorixafor (X4P-001), an advanced, selective CXCR4 inhibitor. When Mavorixafor binds to the same location as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), it disrupts the CXCR4 protein receptor, stopping signals that help cancer grow and spread, as well as the formation of new blood vessels. Mavorixafor blocks cancer cell progression and metastatic growth in different tumor models while strengthening chemotherapy results, radiotherapy outcomes, and checkpoint inhibitor performance. Antagonistic peptides AMD3100 (Plerixafor), LY2510924, and POL6326, as well as their therapeutic potential. Mavorixafor is a promising option for cancer treatments that combine different therapies because it stays attached to its target for a long time and can be taken by mouth. Clinical studies have demonstrated that Mavorixafor produces promising outcomes when combined with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors during the treatment of hematological malignancies alongside solid tumors. Mavorixafor is promising for cancer treatment because it works well with other therapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy, as well as targeted therapies and radiation therapy. Research from Mavorixafor will focus on two main areas: personalized medicine development and new delivery systems and their broad medical applications extending beyond oncology. As a potential CXCR4 antagonist, Mavorixafor shows promise as a transformative tool in cancer care because it regulates the tumor microenvironment (TME) while increasing the degree of therapeutic benefits.}

The optimal antithrombotic therapy (AT) after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is debated. We assessed the impact of intensive vs nonintensive AT on the incidence of device-related thrombus (DRT) based on whether the device implantation was classified as optimal or suboptimal.
Methods
This study included patients who underwent successful LAAC in 9 centers. Patients were classified according to the quality of device implantation: optimal (proximal implant without ≥3mm peridevice leak) or suboptimal (distal implant and/or ≥3mm peridevice leak). Postimplant AT was classified as either intensive (dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, or a combination of both) or nonintensive (no AT or a single antiplatelet therapy). The primary endpoint was the incidence of DRT between the 6th and 12th weeks postprocedure.
Results
A total of 1225 patients underwent LAAC, with 757 (61.8%) achieving optimal device implantation and 468 (38.2%) classified as suboptimal. After a median follow-up of 20 months, the incidence of DRT in the optimal implant group was 2.6% with intensive AT and 3.7% with nonintensive AT (P=.38). In the suboptimal implant group, the incidence of DRT increased to 11.2% with intensive AT and 15.5% with nonintensive AT (P=.19). On multivariate analysis, suboptimal implantation (HR, 4.51; 95%CI, 2.70-7.54, P<.001) but not intensive AT (HR, 0,66; 95%CI, 0.40-1.07, P=.09) emerged as an independent predictor of DRT.
Conclusions
The incidence of DRT after LAAC was higher in patients with suboptimal device implantation. In patients with optimal implantation, the incidence of DRT was low and similar between nonintensive and intensive AT strategies. Large, randomized trials are warranted to confirm these results.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
El tratamiento antitrombótico (TA) óptimo tras el cierre de la orejuela izquierda (COI) es objeto de debate. Se evaluó el impacto de los TA intensivo y no intensivo en la incidencia de trombosis relacionada con el dispositivo (TD) según el implante fuera óptimo o subóptimo.
Métodos
El estudio incluyó a pacientes que se sometieron a un COI exitoso en 9 centros. Se clasificó a los pacientes según el implante del dispositivo fuera óptimo (implante proximal sin fuga peridispositivo ≥3mm) o subóptimo (implante distal y/o fuga ≥3mm) y el TA, intensivo (doble antiagregación plaquetaria, anticoagulación o una combinación de ambas) o no intensivo (sin TA o antiagregación plaquetaria simple) tras el implante. El objetivo primario fue la incidencia de TD entre las semanas 6 y 12 tras el procedimiento.
Resultados
Un total de 1.225 pacientes se sometieron a COI. Se lograron implantes óptimo y subóptimo del dispositivo en 757 (61,8%) y 468 (38,2%) de ellos. Tras un seguimiento de 20 meses, los pacientes con implante óptimo y TA intensivo o no intensivo presentaron una incidencia de TD del 2,6 y el 3,7% (p=0,38). En aquellos con un implante subóptimo, la incidencia de TD aumentó al 11,2% con TA intensivo y el 15,5% con TA no intensivo (p=0,19). En el análisis multivariable, el implante subóptimo (HR=4,51; IC95%, 2,70-7,54; p <0,001), pero no el TA intensivo (HR=0,66; IC95%, 0,40-1,07; p=0,09), se identificó como un predictor independiente de TD.
Conclusiones
La incidencia de TD tras el COI fue mayor en pacientes con implante subóptimo del dispositivo. En el grupo de implante óptimo, la incidencia de TD fue baja y similar entre TA no intensivo y TA intensivo. Se requieren ensayos clínicos grandes y aleatorizados para confirmar estos resultados.}

We propose that the metaverse offers several physical advantages (architecture, music, and nature), social (accessibility, affordability, community-building, and relief of social anxiety), and therapeutic (immersive, anti-inflammatory, and adjunctive use in complementary and integrative medicine). Lifelogging by patients may help clinicians personalize interventions by matching data to therapeutic outcomes. Although the metaverse cannot entirely replace our current model of care, a strategic approach will ensure adequate resource allocation and value assessment. In a collaborative effort between Reulay, Inc and Mayo Clinic, we are building a platform for the delivery of personalized and idiographic interventions to promote healthy longevity. To this end, we are using specific science-informed art design to reduce stress and anxiety for patients, with the progressive addition of integrated care elements that connect to this framework and connect treatment response to biomarkers that are relevant to healthy longevity.

This type of exit can arise due to a variety of reasons, including life situations, strategic reasons, or other interests. The process of selling a small, privately held company, oftentimes facilitated by business intermediaries, typically begins with introducing the company to potential acquirers through confidential marketing that provides just enough information to pique interest while also preserving the anonymity of the entrepreneur or business. One important element included in the marketing of a business is the entrepreneur's reason to sell. Due to the potential information asymmetry present in the sale of privately-held businesses, this study proposes that the reason for sale, referred to in this study as the communicated exit purpose, sends varying signals to potential acquirers impacting the perception of the business opportunity and acquisition price at exit. Utilizing an archival dataset from a popular business-for-sale website, our analysis shows support that the price at exit is affected by the communicated entrepreneur's reason for exit. A separate experiment and qualitative study provide further insight into the acquirer perceptions of the business opportunity based on the stated reason of entrepreneurial exit. Our paper concludes with strategies to assist entrepreneurs regarding the disclosure of reasons for exiting.}

To address these issues, we propose BatteryGPT, a frozen pre-trained Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) framework tailored for lithium-ion battery energy forecasting. Instead of retraining the entire model, our approach fine-tunes only the input embedding and output projection layers, enabling efficient adaptation to varied battery conditions. To enhance temporal feature representation, we introduce a contrastive temporal embedding module that compresses multivariate sequences while retaining essential dynamic features. Furthermore, we design a temporal suffix alignment strategy to align time-series data with textual prompts, improving the model’s capacity for temporal reasoning. Experiments show that BatteryGPT achieves an average 55.52% improvement in prediction accuracy over LSTM and conventional deep learning baselines. Instruction-based evaluations further demonstrate its end-to-end applicability in dynamic charging management scenarios. These results highlight the potential of integrating large language models with time-series adaptation techniques for industrial energy forecasting tasks.}

A series of aluminum micropillar evaporators were fabricated through ion etching, and dense boehmite nanostructures were synthesized on the surfaces using boiling water treatment. The thermal performance of the evaporators was assessed in a vacuum chamber under controlled conditions. The experimental results quantitatively demonstrated the effect of micropillar structural parameters on the thermal performance of the evaporator. A critical heat flux of 217.4 W/cm2 and a heat transfer coefficient of 102.3 kW/m2K were achieved for a sample with a pillar height of 500 μm, a unit size of 1200 μm, and a length-to-gap ratio of 1.27.

To evaluate the quality, readability, and accuracy of large language model (LLM)–generated patient education materials (PEMs) on childhood glaucoma, and their ability to improve existing the readability of online information.
DESIGN
Cross-sectional comparative study.
METHODS
We evaluated responses of ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard to 3 separate prompts requesting that they write PEMs on “childhood glaucoma.” Prompt A required PEMs be “easily understandable by the average American.” Prompt B required that PEMs be written “at a 6th-grade level using Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability formula.” We then compared responses’ quality (DISCERN questionnaire, Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool [PEMAT]), readability (SMOG, Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level [FKGL]), and accuracy (Likert Misinformation scale). To assess the improvement of readability for existing online information, Prompt C requested that LLM rewrite 20 resources from a Google search of keyword “childhood glaucoma” to the American Medical Association–recommended “6th-grade level.” Rewrites were compared on key metrics such as readability, complex words (≥3 syllables), and sentence count.
RESULTS
All 3 LLMs generated PEMs that were of high quality, understandability, and accuracy (DISCERN ≥4, ≥70% PEMAT understandability, Misinformation score = 1). Prompt B responses were more readable than Prompt A responses for all 3 LLM (P ≤ .001). ChatGPT-4 generated the most readable PEMs compared to ChatGPT-3.5 and Bard (P ≤ .001). Although Prompt C responses showed consistent reduction of mean SMOG and FKGL scores, only ChatGPT-4 achieved the specified 6th-grade reading level (4.8 ± 0.8 and 3.7 ± 1.9, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS
LLMs can serve as strong supplemental tools in generating high-quality, accurate, and novel PEMs, and improving the readability of existing PEMs on childhood glaucoma.}

abstract = {Background
The combination of radiotherapy (RT) with targeted agents or immunotherapy may result in improved outcomes, but it can also increase toxicity. However, there is a paucity of high-quality toxicity data, leading to an absence of evidence-based guidelines.
Design
To address this, ESMO and ESTRO initiated a series of systematic reviews followed by a Delphi consensus process to develop multidisciplinary, evidence-based consensus statements regarding the safety of combining RT with such agents. The current publication describes the combination of RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), vascular endothelial growth factor (receptor) (VEGF(R)) inhibitors, or multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). By systematically covering different drug classes and irradiated areas, 76 clinical scenarios were evaluated during two Delphi rounds with 20 international experts. Safety statements were developed for each scenario, based on the systematic literature reviews.
Results
A total of 5,921 records were screened during the systematic literature review process for ICIs, VEGF(R) inhibitors and multitargeted TKIs, and 159 reports were selected for inclusion in the final literature reviews and the database. During the two Delphi rounds, agreement was reached regarding the safety statements for 74 clinical scenarios.
Conclusions
Generally, the expected toxicity of combining RT with ICIs is low, particularly for PD-(L)1 inhibitors. For most combinations with VEGF(R) inhibitors and multitargeted TKIs, exercising caution is recommended. The evidence-based safety statements developed during this comprehensive project, provide practical guidance on combining RT with targeted cancer therapies and immunotherapy.}

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is independently associated with risk of atherosclerotic events, even when LDL-cholesterol levels appear controlled. This INTERASPIRE study determined the frequency of HTG and residual combined dyslipidemia and their related factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) from 13 countries across six World Health Organization (WHO) regions.
Methods
Participants with CHD underwent a standardized study interview and examination, including a centralized analysis of fasting blood samples. Elevated triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol were defined as ≥ 1.7 mmol/L and 1.8 mmol/L, respectively. Elevation in both was considered combined dyslipidemia.
Results
Lipid profiles were available for 4069 patients. The mean age was 60.1 years (21.1 % women, 12.6 % smokers, 24 % obesity by body mass index [BMI], 61 % hypertension, and 44 % self-reported diabetes). Participants were evaluated 1.05 (0.76–1.45) years after their index CHD hospitalization. Overall, 12.7 % used no lipid-lowering therapies (LLT), 50.0 % used high-dose statins, and 11.8 % used combination therapies. Specific TG-lowering therapies were used by 2.3 %. One-third of patients had HTG, and 24.6 % had combined dyslipidemia. HTG was seen in all countries, but median TG values varied, with higher values among those not using LLT. HTG was independently associated with female sex, smoking, BMI, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol. HTG was inversely associated with HDL-cholesterol.
Conclusions
HTG and residual combined dyslipidemia are common, although with wide variability between countries. A healthier lifestyle, weight reduction, greater use of combination therapy, and evidence-based TG-lowering treatments are necessary to reduce the risks of HTG and combined dyslipidemia.}

abstract = {Background
Telemedicine offers a multitude of potential advantages, such as enhanced health care accessibility, cost reduction, and improved patient outcomes. The significance of telemedicine has been underscored by the COVID-19 pandemic, as it plays a crucial role in maintaining uninterrupted care while minimizing the risk of viral exposure. However, the adoption and implementation of telemedicine have been relatively sluggish in certain areas. Assessing the level of interest in telemedicine can provide valuable insights into areas that require enhancement.
Objective
The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the level of public and research interest in telemedicine from 2017 to 2022 and also consider any potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Google Trends data were retrieved using the search topics “telemedicine” or “e-health” to assess public interest, geographic distribution, and trends through a joinpoint regression analysis. Bibliographic data from Scopus were used to chart publications referencing the terms “telemedicine” or “eHealth” (in the title, abstract, and keywords) in terms of scientific production, key countries, and prominent keywords, as well as collaboration and co-occurrence networks.
Results
Worldwide, telemedicine generated higher mean public interest (relative search volume=26.3%) compared to eHealth (relative search volume=17.6%). Interest in telemedicine remained stable until January 2020, experienced a sudden surge (monthly percent change=95.7%) peaking in April 2020, followed by a decline (monthly percent change=–22.7%) until August 2020, and then returned to stability. A similar trend was noted in the public interest regarding eHealth. Chile, Australia, Canada, and the United States had the greatest public interest in telemedicine. In these countries, moderate to strong correlations were evident between Google Trends and COVID-19 data (ie, new cases, new deaths, and hospitalized patients). Examining 19,539 original medical articles in the Scopus database unveiled a substantial rise in telemedicine-related publications, showing a total increase of 201.5% from 2017 to 2022 and an average annual growth rate of 24.7%. The most significant surge occurred between 2019 and 2020. Notably, the majority of the publications originated from a single country, with 20.8% involving international coauthorships. As the most productive country, the United States led a cluster that included Canada and Australia as well. European, Asian, and Latin American countries made up the remaining 3 clusters. The co-occurrence network categorized prevalent keywords into 2 clusters, the first cluster primarily focused on applying eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), or digital health to noncommunicable or chronic diseases; the second cluster was centered around the application of telemedicine and telehealth within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
Our analysis of search and bibliographic data over time and across regions allows us to gauge the interest in this topic, offer evidence regarding potential applications, and pinpoint areas for additional research and awareness-raising initiatives.}

Reflective assignments are a powerful tool in undergraduate STEM courses to promote student metacognition and give instructors and researchers a view of that process. We were interested in understanding student challenges in our developmental biology course, so we used reflective assignments to uncover these challenges and also add to our understanding of student metacognition in upper-level courses. We used structural and initial coding and themed student responses. Then, we were able to compare results across two different course formats. We also compared these analyses with student performance on weekly formative assessments and completed item analysis. Our analyses suggest that students struggle the most with application. Notably, student responses did not differ in an asynchronous online class versus a high-flex in-person class. We also surveyed students (n = 162) on their use and perceived value of the metacognitive assignments for further comparison to other studies of upper-level student metacognitive regulation. Results indicate a strong majority of students completed more than half of the assignments, found the assignments beneficial to their learning, and used the opportunity to plan study time. Overall, we find that upper-level college students have accurate metacognitive knowledge, allowing them to identify challenging topics and cognitive skills, and have acquired the metacognitive regulation tools to develop study plans when prompted by a reflective assignment.}

At the personal level, it can cause distress among women. At the societal level, women have to face discrimination and isolation, all of which take a toll on their mental health. The present study aims to understand how support from kinship networks, particularly spousal and familial support might facilitate or act as barriers to better coping with the stress, anxiety and depression caused by infertility among women living with infertility. The study was part of a larger research project funded by the National Commission for Women, India, it included qualitative interviews with 30 infertile women, comprising 15 high scorers in at least two mental health variables (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) and 15 low scorers with minimal scores in at least two of these variables. Grounded theory was employed for data analysis and interpretation. Upon interviewing the women, it was found that important factors supporting coping in women were spousal and family support. Further it was found that these factors promoting good mental well-being did not function separately but were in conjunction with each other. We argue that kinship support is fundamental to coping with infertility in India, and that emotional support and understanding provided by partners and loved ones can be critical in enhancing and maintaining the mental well-being of women dealing with infertility.}

abstract = {In the education of socially disadvantaged students, attention is often paid to the role of teachers who can either reduce educational inequalities or, conversely, contribute to the deepening of the achievement gap. A possible framework for understanding teacher contributions to the education of socially disadvantaged students is the concept of student engagement. This multiple case study was conducted in five schools with a high proportion of socially disadvantaged students. Repeated interviews were conducted with teachers, school management, parents, students, and counselors at selected schools. The study thus focuses on teachers’ strategies to support engagement among socially disadvantaged students during teaching with regard to the affective, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of engagement. The results show that teachers implement strategies that foster engagement among socially disadvantaged students. Teaching is designed to be interesting for students and evoke positive emotions, support the development of trust-based relationships, and respond to the individual learning needs of students. This support is directed primarily at encouraging participation, whereas support for learning itself tends to be rather secondary—often due to low expectations and teaching goals oriented more toward the perceived practical life orientations of the students.}

Nevertheless, it is quite challenging to design multiband topological structures on demand via traditional empirical methods that rely on trial and error. Here, we present a novel inverse design paradigm for multiband higher-order elastic topological insulators based on deep learning techniques. A generative model that enables a vast design space is first developed, incorporating a rich series of unit cell patterns with the desired crystalline symmetry and fabrication feasibility. Thereafter, a predictive model is constructed to efficiently forecast the dispersion characteristics of any given unit cell, thereby accelerating the discovery of potential multiband topological structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reusability of the proposed design framework through diverse examples of multiband higher-order elastic topological insulators with multi-frequency corner states. This deep learning-driven approach addresses the limitations of conventional inverse design methods, which often require computationally expensive simulations and lack flexibility to variable design tasks. Our work underscores great potential of deep learning techniques for the inverse design of high-performance topological metamaterials.}

abstract = {Background
Population-based penetrance studies of breast cancer gene 1/2 (BRCA1/2) pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in the Eastern Chinese population are currently lacking; thus, we aimed to investigate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors among BRCA1/2 P/LP variant carriers using a population-based breast cancer cohort from communities in Eastern China.
Methods
Between July 2019 and March 2021, we tested 2216 breast cancer probands from Chinese communities for BRCA1/2 mutations and collected detailed information on the age, survival status, and malignancy history of first-degree relatives. The kin-cohort method was used to calculate the penetrance of breast cancer and other malignant tumors.
Results
Of the 2216 breast cancer probands, 109 (4.90%) carried BRCA1/2 P/LP variants, 49 in the BRCA1 gene and 60 in the BRCA2 gene. The penetrance of female breast cancer by 85 years of age was 22.50% and 18.20% in BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers, respectively. The penetrance of ovarian cancer by 85 years of age was 26.00% in BRCA1 P/LP variant carriers. The penetrance of other malignancies did not reach statistical significance owing to the small number of events.
Conclusions
Our findings showed that breast cancer penetrance among BRCA1 and BRCA2 P/LP variant carriers was 22.50% and 18.20%, respectively, which suggests that prophylactic mastectomy may not be necessary for such Chinese individuals.

The permeance of He, Ar, and N2 demonstrated a trend of activated diffusion as permeance increased with an increase in the temperature; O2 permeance, however, reached its maximum value at about −80 °C. O2 permeance increased with a decrease in the temperature (30 to −80 °C), and permeance then gradually decreased (−80 to −130 °C), which demonstrates surface diffusion. In the case of O2/He binary separation, both O2 and He permeated according to molecular sieving at 30 °C, but at −115 °C, O2/He selectivity was enhanced approximately 10-fold due to permeation blockage by adsorbed O2. On the other hand, in the case of O2/N2 binary separation at −115 °C, the effect of permeation blocking by adsorbed O2 permeance was lessened due to the effect of competitive adsorption, which translated to a level of O2/N2 selectivity that was only 1.5-fold higher than that at 30 °C.}

A novel configurational moderation approach is adopted to assess the impact of digital transformation on the 27 EU countries’ national systems of innovation (NSI). Results showed that the presence of all innovation inputs is a sufficient configuration for the presence of high innovation outputs, while three different configurations were found to be sufficient for its absence. The configurational moderation analysis revealed that digital transformation effectively moderates the arrangement of innovation inputs leading to the presence of high innovation outputs, where the human capital and research pillar loses its importance. The results of this study can be understood as benchmarks, against which less innovative countries may compare and develop their NSI. They also shed light on the specific configurations followed by each EU country in achieving innovation outputs, which could be an input for Union-based policies directed at the development of concrete innovation pillars in specific Member States. Furthermore, findings enlighten international business managers about the strengths and weaknesses of EU countries’ NSI, which may aid them in their internationalisation decisions.}

abstract = {On an industrial scale, producing a large amount of oxygen with high purity usually utilizes cryogenic air separation processes. Air separation units (ASUs) consume large amounts of electricity to produce oxygen. Therefore, ASUs with energy-saving processes are required. However, improvements of ASUs including reducing energy consumption by making use of only distillation have nearly reached the limit. Membrane separation, which can extract products consecutively without gas–liquid equilibrium limitation, is highly appreciated for integration with distillation to produce oxygen. However, oxygen permeation property at cryogenic temperature with membranes has not yet been clarified. This study investigates the oxygen separation property with membranes at low temperatures based on bis(triethoxysilyl)methane (BTESM) called bridged-type organosilica. Microporous structure is successfully controlled via calcination and the effectiveness of network pore size on oxygen separation properties is discussed. Oxygen selectivity (O2/Ar, O2/N2) increases as permeation temperature decreases, irrespective of the network pore size of BTESM membranes. Particularly, a BTESM membrane of network pore size 0.45 nm shows high oxygen selectivity (O2/Ar = 13.5, O2/N2 = 13.2) at −115 °C. In the case of an O2/He system, O2/He selectivity by binary separation is largely enhanced as O2/He selectivity by single permeation increases. Since high O2/He selectivity indicates a larger network pore size (less effective molecular sieving), preferentially adsorbed oxygen effectivity blocks He permeation. For the binary separation of O2/Ar and O2/N2 at −115 °C, oxygen selectivity by binary separation is approximately the same as that by single permeation due to the negligible difference in adsorption properties of oxygen, argon, and nitrogen.}

abstract = {Ankle motor control is crucial for balance maintenance and fall prevention. Neurocomputational models of motor control suggest that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a critical role in estimating body and environmental states, a process fundamental to motor control. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical excitability and alter behaviors accordingly. This study explored the impact of atDCS over the PPC on ankle tracking visuomotor control using a motor adaptation research paradigm in healthy young adults. Thirty-eight participants were randomly assigned to either an atDCS or sham control group. All participants completed an ankle tracking experiment divided into three phases: pre-adaptation, adaptation, and re-adaptation, with each phase comprising eight blocks of five trials. During the experiment, each participant wore a sensor on the non-dominant foot and performed continuous dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movements to track a target cursor on a screen. Visual feedback of the foot position was provided, with a 1:1 feedback ratio in the pre- and re-adaptation phases and a 2.5:1 ratio in the adaptation phase to promote visual-motor remapping. The atDCS group received 20 min of 2 mA atDCS over the PPC during the adaptation phase. Tracking performance on each trial was measured as the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the target and actual movement trajectories. Both groups showed similar RMSEs in the pre-adaptation phase (p > 0.05). However, in the adaptation phase, the atDCS group demonstrated a significant reduction from block 1 to block 2 (p = 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.86) and maintained this improved performance in the following blocks, while the sham group showed no significant changes throughout this phase (p > 0.05). In the re-adaptation phase, both groups quickly returned to their pre-adaptation performance levels. These findings indicate that neither the atDCS nor the sham group adapted to the high visual feedback ratio. However, the early reduction in RMSE observed in the atDCS group suggests that atDCS over the PPC may transiently enhance ankle tracking visuomotor control under the heightened visual feedback ratio condition, resulting in short-term improvements. Future research is warranted to explore whether multiple atDCS sessions over the PPC could provide long-term benefits for lower extremity visuomotor control.}

abstract = {Microbial communities inhabiting the gut of host species have been recognized as a significant factor influencing the success of aquaculture as they directly/indirectly control the overall physiology and biochemistry of the host. In terms of shrimp aquaculture, gut microbiome changes (i.e., periodic succession) during development phases and interacts with the host (i.e., shrimp), contributing to several physiological processes such as digestion, absorption of nutrients, intestinal homeostasis, inhibition of pathogens and more importantly immunity. Therefore, periodically analyzing gut microbiome can be considered an attractive proposal for shrimp aquaculture, especially shrimp health management. Any change in the normal microbial flora in the gut system of the host is termed “dysbiosis.” As for health management, utilizing probiotics paves the way for the restoration of a normal microbial community, which is termed “eubiosis.” However, screening, designing, and applying probiotics requires prior knowledge of the host microbiome. A proper understanding of the driving factors determining the selection and colonization of specific microbes in the gut is also essential. In this review, we have compiled the gut microbiome data of Penaeus monodon, which was reported from different geographical locations. Besides, we have integrated data on the sediment and rearing water microbiome of shrimp culture ponds reported from previous studies. In doing so, we have constructed the networking between gut, sediment, and water microbiota to determine the eubiosis or dysbiosis state-of-art for shrimp health. In addition, we propose an Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning (AI-DL) based approach for the identification of shrimp health status based on external anatomy features such as detection of disease symptoms and to take preventive measures by modulating gut microbiome to achieve sustainable shrimp production.}

Generative AI is revolutionizing patient education in healthcare, particularly through chatbots that offer personalized, clear medical information. Reliability and accuracy are vital in AI-driven patient education.
Research question
How effective are Large Language Models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and Google Bard, in delivering accurate and understandable patient education on lumbar disc herniation?
Material and methods
Ten Frequently Asked Questions about lumbar disc herniation were selected from 133 questions and were submitted to three LLMs. Six experienced spine surgeons rated the responses on a scale from “excellent” to “unsatisfactory,” and evaluated the answers for exhaustiveness, clarity, empathy, and length. Statistical analysis involved Fleiss Kappa, Chi-square, and Friedman tests.
Results
Out of the responses, 27.2% were excellent, 43.9% satisfactory with minimal clarification, 18.3% satisfactory with moderate clarification, and 10.6% unsatisfactory. There were no significant differences in overall ratings among the LLMs (p = 0.90); however, inter-rater reliability was not achieved, and large differences among raters were detected in the distribution of answer frequencies. Overall, ratings varied among the 10 answers (p = 0.043). The average ratings for exhaustiveness, clarity, empathy, and length were above 3.5/5.
Discussion and conclusion
LLMs show potential in patient education for lumbar spine surgery, with generally positive feedback from evaluators. The new EU AI Act, enforcing strict regulation on AI systems, highlights the need for rigorous oversight in medical contexts. In the current study, the variability in evaluations and occasional inaccuracies underline the need for continuous improvement. Future research should involve more advanced models to enhance patient-physician communication.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the country's substantial liver cancer burden, there is limited research on the factors influencing the place of death (POD) of patients with liver cancer in China. This study aimed to delineate POD distribution among patients with liver cancer, identify the factors associated with hospital deaths, and offer valuable insights for the government to develop healthcare policies.
Methods
Data from 2013 to 2020 were obtained from the National Mortality Surveillance System (NMSS) of China. This analysis focused on the distribution of POD among individuals who succumbed to liver cancer. Variations in characteristic distributions across different categories were evaluated using a chi-squared test. We also applied a multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with hospital liver cancer deaths. The proportional change in variance was computed to evaluate the contributions of different factors in the model.
Results
From 2013 to 2020, the NMSS reported a total of 608,789 liver cancer-related deaths, of which 440,079 (72.29%) died at home, and 158,291 (26.00%) died in the hospital. Home remained the preferred POD among patients with liver cancer. The results demonstrated that female patients, aged between 0 and 14 years, of Han ethnicity, living in urban areas, unmarried, highly educated, and either employed in a professional, staff, or civil servant capacity, or retired patients tended to end their lives in the hospital.
Conclusions
In China, home continues to be the predominant POD for patients with liver cancer, with demographic and socioeconomic factors significantly influencing whether a hospital is their POD. Enhancing healthcare policymakers' understanding of the factors influencing the place of death for patients with liver cancer may assist in creating a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources and providing a variety of choices for minorities with distinct preferences for end-of-life care.}

abstract = {Objectives
To determine whether the regular consumption of milk free from A1 β-casein (A1PF milk) improves cognitive performance to a greater extent than conventional milk, and if so, whether such improvements are associated with an increase in the serum titres of reduced glutathione (GSH).
Design
A multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms, conducted from 7 March 2023 to 13 October 2023.
Setting
Two hospitals in Tianjin, China.
Participants
Volunteers (N = 96) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and aged between 65 and 75 years.
Intervention
A1PF skim milk powder or conventional skim milk powder, diluted into liquid form (200 mL) and consumed twice daily for 90 days.
Measurements
The primary outcomes were cognitive performance (assessed with the Subtle Cognitive Impairment Test [SCIT]) and serum titres of GSH. Secondary outcomes included performance on two other cognitive tests, serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, subjective quality of life (QoL), muscle strength (hand grip scale), faecal and blood inflammatory markers.
Results
Data from 91 participants were analysed (A1PF milk group: n = 45; conventional milk group: n = 46). A1PF milk improved performance on all three cognitive tests to a greater extent than conventional milk; however, this improvement was not associated with an increase in serum GSH. When compared with conventional milk, A1PF milk resulted in higher increases in serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, greater subjective improvements in QoL and improved left hand grip strength. There were no between-group differences in inflammatory markers, calcium absorption or bone density markers.
Conclusion
Daily intake of A1PF milk for 90 days significantly improved cognition, QoL and muscle strength in a sample of older people with MCI. While these outcomes appear to be linked to increased serum titres of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, further investigations are needed to confirm this association.
