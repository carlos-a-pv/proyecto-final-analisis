abstract = {The rise of image-generative AI has made it a crucial tool for image creators, gaining popularity in fields such as cartography, design, and photography. As users increasingly rely on AI for image creation, understanding the factors that drive user value becomes essential. Drawing on systems theory, this study proposes a conceptual framework to examine the relationships among integration effort, compatibility, synergy, and value creation. Data from 531 AI image creators supported our hypotheses, revealing that: (1) integration effort significantly enhances both compatibility and synergy; (2) compatibility positively influences synergy; (3) synergy directly and positively impacts user value creation; and (4) synergy serves as a critical mediator in the relationships between the two enablers—compatibility and integration effort—and user value creation, with compatibility also partially mediating the link between integration effort and synergy. These results extend systems theory by integrating it more deeply with the resource-based view and highlighting synergy as a pivotal factor that not only directly drives user value creation but also mediates the effects of compatibility and integration effort. Furthermore, the study empirically confirms that user value can be conceptualized through three key constructs: efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.}

abstract = {Capturing the time evolution and predicting kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems present significant challenges due to the precision and computational effort required. In this study, we demonstrate that ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)’, an artificial intelligence model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories akin to the vocabulary corpus of a language, we show that a GPT-based model can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables GPT to predict kinetically accurate sequences of states for a diverse set of biomolecules of varying complexity, at a much quicker pace than traditional MD simulations and with a better efficiency than other baseline time-series prediction approaches. More significantly, the approach is found to be equally adept at forecasting the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium active systems that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of the mechanism inherent in GPT reveals the crucial role of the ‘self-attention mechanism’ in capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Together, our results highlight generative artificial intelligence's ability to generate kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems with statistical precision.}

As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is creating new learning experiences, understanding the impact of five representative personality traits on students' self-regulated learning (SRL) while learning with GenAI tools can help to predict which personality traits indicate better self-regulation when learning with this innovative educational technology. Such a prediction can help educators to design effective learning activities by providing educational experiences that cater to students' different personality traits for specific learning objectives in the GenAI context. This study explored how variations in five representative personality traits affect students’ SRL performance when learning with ChatGPT. It used an explanatory approach based on structural equation modelling with a path analysis design. Four hundred and nine university students participated in the study and finished a self-reported questionnaire with validated items that are driven by previous studies. The results revealed that the personality traits of openness, extraversion, and agreeableness were significant predictors of all three stages of SRL; conscientiousness was a significant predictor of the forethought and self-reflection stages; and neuroticism failed to predict any of the three stages of SRL. These results may be attributable to the subjective nature of personality traits and the cognitive characteristics of SRL skills. The findings enrich the literature on SRL by introducing personality traits and GenAI as innovative perspectives and suggesting corresponding strategies for supporting different stages of SRL.}

The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5′ UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5′ UTR sequences and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5′ UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼200%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for mRNA 5′ UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed online.}

We conducted two waves of surveys, one pre- and one post-GenAI integration, to compare consumer perceptions across three customer service tasks. Using the Service Robot Acceptance Model (SRAM) as a framework, we found that GenAI enhances consumer perceptions of chatbot usefulness, human-likeness, and familiarity, thereby increasing adoption intentions. However, trust remains largely unchanged, and privacy concerns have risen post-GenAI. Additionally, the relationships remain stable across customer journey stages, with familiarity playing a key role.

However, its impact on consumer behavior has remained empirically untested. In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content creation rather than to replace them through automation. Our findings underscore the need for nuance in brands’ GenAI adoption to unlock economic benefits without compromising on relationships with consumers.}

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI’s potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI’s ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI’s transformative potential.

Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.}

The Food and Drug Administration mandates patient labeling materials like the Medication Guide (MG) and Instructions for Use (IFU) to support appropriate medication use. However, challenges such as low health literacy and difficulties navigating these materials may lead to incorrect medication usage, resulting in therapy failure or adverse outcomes. The rise of generative AI, presents an opportunity to provide scalable, personalized patient education through image recognition and text generation.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of medication instructions generated by ChatGPT based on user-provided drug images, compared to the manufacturer's standard instructions.
Methods
Images of 12 medications requiring multiple steps for administration were uploaded to ChatGPT's image recognition function. ChatGPT's responses were compared to the official IFU and MG using text classifiers, Count Vectorization (CountVec), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The clinical accuracy was further evaluated by independent pharmacists to determine if ChatGPT responses were valid for patient instruction.
Results
ChatGPT correctly identified all medications and generated patient instructions. CountVec outperformed TF-IDF in text similarity analysis, with an average similarity score of 76%. However, clinical evaluation revealed significant gaps in the instructions, particularly for complex administration routes, where ChatGPT's guidance lacked essential details, leading to lower clinical accuracy scores.
Conclusion
While ChatGPT shows promise in generating patient-friendly medication instructions, its effectiveness varies based on the complexity of the medication. The findings underscore the need for further refinement and clinical oversight to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI-generated medical guidance, particularly for medications with complex administration processes.}

A double-blind scoring design was used, with 6 experienced clinical pharmacists (≥5 years experience) evaluating the AI responses across 6 dimensions: accuracy, rigor, applicability, logical coherence, conciseness, and universality, scored 0‐10 per predefined criteria (eg, −3 for inaccuracy and −2 for incomplete rigor). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc testing and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for interrater reliability (2-way random model). Qualitative thematic analysis identified recurrent errors and limitations.
Results
DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek) achieved the highest overall performance (mean composite score: medication consultation 9.4, SD 1.0; case analysis 9.3, SD 1.0), significantly outperforming others in complex tasks (P<.05). Critical limitations were observed across models, including high-risk decision errors—75% omitted critical contraindications (eg, ethambutol in optic neuritis) and a lack of localization—90% erroneously recommended macrolides for drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (China’s high-resistance setting), while only DeepSeek-R1 aligned with updated American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for pediatric doxycycline. Complex reasoning deficits: only Claude-3.5-Sonnet detected a gender-diagnosis contradiction (prostatic hyperplasia in female); no model identified diazepam’s 7-day prescription limit. Interrater consistency was lowest for conciseness in case analysis (ICC=0.70), reflecting evaluator disagreement on complex outputs. ERNIE Bot (Baidu) consistently underperformed (case analysis: 6.8, SD 1.5; P<.001 vs DeepSeek-R1).
Conclusions
While generative AI shows promise as a pharmacist assistance tool, significant limitations—including high-risk errors (eg, contraindication omissions), inadequate localization, and complex reasoning gaps—preclude autonomous clinical decision-making. Performance stratification highlights DeepSeek-R1’s current advantage, but all systems require optimization in dynamic knowledge updating, complex scenario reasoning, and output interpretability. Future deployment must prioritize human oversight (human-AI co-review), ethical safeguards, and continuous evaluation frameworks.}

abstract = {This chapter explores the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for increasing the accessibility of the toxicological research published for the scientific community for nonspecialist audiences who may need this information for a wide range of important purposes. Translating and summarizing, in plain language, the specialized terminology, intricate statistical models, and interdisciplinary knowledge inherent in this field presents significant challenges which have historically been addressed with human intermediaries and their associated cost and time. Freely available chat-enabled large language models offer the ability to automatically generate a range of cost-effective plain language summaries. These capabilities are accompanied by several limitations such as oversimplification and the risk of inaccuracies which must be considered. Also considered are the ethical considerations such as the need to emphasize transparency, cultural sensitivities, and mitigation of bias in generative AI outputs. The importance of human quality assurance in maintaining scientific accuracy, context, and public trust is critical to responsible applications of this approach. By advocating for a balanced approach that leverages AI's scalability while preserving scientific rigor, this chapter promotes the thoughtful integration of AI in environmental toxicology research translation, ultimately envisioning its role in enhancing public understanding, informing policy, and fostering equitable access to scientific knowledge. An illustrative case exercise provides a step-by-step process for creating these summaries.}

The study proposes that it isn't possible to harness the potential benefits of AI technologies unless students' concerns about these technologies are suitably addressed. Although the number of potential benefits specifically related to the use of AI in education is enormous, addressing students' concerns about AI is essential to ensure the effective use of these technologies in education. The correlational survey model was used in this study. Four well-established instruments were employed to collect data from students who studied in different public university faculties in Turkey. Participants were selected from students who had been using AI tools for educational purposes for at least six months. The findings showed that cognitive flexibility, digital competencies and self-regulation skills impact on AI anxiety. Students with high cognitive flexibility had lower AI anxiety, while students with high digital competencies were better able to comprehend and use AI technologies. In addition, students with high self-regulation skills were able to manage their own learning processes more effectively and experienced less anxiety in using AI. As a result, increasing university students' digital competencies and self-regulation skills can be influential in reducing their AI anxiety. Accordingly, educational institutions could offer programs to develop students' digital competencies and AI literacy. These programs can help them adapt to AI technologies more easily and reduce their anxiety about these technologies by teaching students how to use AI technologies effectively and efficiently.}

Pesticides play a pivotal role in ensuring food security, and the development of green pesticides is an inevitable trend in global agricultural progress. Although deep learning-based generative models have revolutionized de novo drug design in pharmaceutical research, their application in pesticide research and development remains unexplored.
Objectives
This study aims to pioneer the application of generative artificial intelligence to pesticide design by proposing a reinforcement learning-based framework for obtaining pesticide-like molecules with high binding affinity.
Methods
This framework comprises two key components: PestiGen-G, which systematically explores the pesticide-like chemical space using a character-based generative model coupled with the REINFORCE algorithm; and PestiGen-S, which combines a fragment-based generative model with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to generate molecules that stably bind to the specific target protein.
Results
Experimental results show that the molecules generated by PestiGen have superior pesticide-likeness and binding affinity compared to those generated by existing methods. In addition, we employ an active learning strategy to reduce the false-positive rate of the generated molecules. Finally, through collaboration with domain experts, we successfully designed a novel 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor (YH23768) with favorable enzyme inhibition and herbicidal potency.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study highlights the utility of PestiGen as a valuable tool for pesticide design. The web server based on the model is freely available at https://dpai.ccnu.edu.cn/PestiGen/.}

We developed a custom microfluidic device with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels and integrated electrodes to capture electrical impedance data. The device was fabricated using photolithography, electron beam evaporation, and lift-off techniques. Instead of traditional imaging methods, electrical impedance signals were used to reconstruct cell images. A generative AI model with eight hidden layers processed 191 impedance values to accurately reconstruct the shapes of cancer cells and control beads. Our approach successfully reconstructed images of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, HeLa cells, and beads, achieving 91 % accuracy on the test dataset. Validation using the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) produced scores of 0.97 for breast cancer cells and 0.93 for beads, confirming the high precision of this method. This label-free, impedance-based imaging offers a promising solution for cancer diagnostics by accurately reconstructing cell shapes and distinguishing cell types, particularly in point-of-care applications.}

Traditional design methods often focus on reconstructing functional motifs, but they face challenges in stabilizing structure and reproducing function. In this study, we aimed to develop a design method for small proteins using ProtGPT2, a model that generates protein sequences based on function and structure. First, amino acid sequence data of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was collected, and ProtGPT2 was fine-tuned (ProtGPT2 for MDH). The chain length and perplexity (ppl) of the generated sequences were evaluated, producing shorter sequences than the natural ones. The validity of the generated sequences was assessed using both population and individual analyses. Population analysis, including multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), revealed that ProtGPT2 for MDH identified functional motifs of MDH and incorporated them into the generated sequences. Additionally, tSNE showed that the generated sequences were highly similar to natural MDH sequences. In individual analysis, 10 randomly selected sequences were evaluated using BLAST, AlphaFold2, and InterPro. BLAST indicated that 9 sequences were novel MDH variants. AlphaFold2 confirmed that their 3D structures were highly similar to known MDH structures. InterPro identified domains and active sites in 2 sequences, suggesting that they were novel, small MDH variants. In conclusion, ProtGPT2 for MDH has the potential to design amino acid sequence candidates for small MDHs. The validity and utility of the model will be established through future experimental efforts.}

At the core of this innovative approach lies the fusion of artificially generated digital rock images, created using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, with their authentic counterparts. This fusion is guided by the overarching objective of augmenting the efficacy of various digital rock analysis applications. This integration endeavors to bridge the gap between the limited available data and the substantial demands of the digital rock analysis domain. The practical significance and potential of this integrated approach are vividly demonstrated through a series of concrete implementations. These include, but are by no means limited to, enhancing image quality to facilitate clearer visualization of intricate rock structures and refining the estimation of petrophysical properties with increased accuracy.}

The risks use and biases are outlined, and appropriate use guidelines framed for use of generative AI in nuclear medicine. Generative AI text-to-text and text-to-image generation includes inherent biases, particularly gender and ethnicity, that could misrepresent nuclear medicine. The assimilation of generative AI tools into medical education, image interpretation, patient education, health promotion and marketing in nuclear medicine risks propagating errors and amplification of biases.

abstract = {Represented by ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is revolutionizing the field of education. Despite a series of related studies and reviews around GAI, existing reviews predominantly focus on macro-level discussions covering overall development trends, core issues, opportunities and risks. There has been a lack of systematic reviews from a meso-level perspective examining the application of GAI in classroom teaching within higher education. This study employs a systematic literature review method, examining 139 articles from Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. Findings include: (1)In terms of disciplines and types of GAI applications, engineering, health and medicine, and language are the most popular, while humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, mathematics, sports sciences, and interdisciplinary fields have fewer applications. Based on Strobel's classification of GAI(2024), it is found that Generators, Reimaginators, and Assistants are the most widely applied types of GAI. In contrast, Synthesizers and Enablers are less commonly utilized. Regarding the adoption trends across disciplines, engineering and language have a diverse range of GAI product types applied, whereas health and medicine has fewer types of GAI products in use. Due to smaller sample sizes, the analysis of GAI product types in the remaining six disciplines is also relatively limited. (2)In terms of the application of GAI across different disciplines, a small portion of GAI applications reflect distinctive disciplinary characteristics. Regarding the roles mapped out by the application of GAI, based on Xu and Ouyang's classification(2022), instructors or students predominantly perceive GAI as “New Subject” or “Direct Mediator", with less emphasis on the role of “Supplement Assistant”. Regarding the integration into the classroom, as assessed through the SAMR framework, most GAI applications are in the Augmentation level. There are also some in the Substitution and Modification levels, while applications in the Redefinition level are relatively rare. (3)In terms of the selection of instructional strategies under GAI applications, there are 18 types of strategies across four orientations, primarily emphasizing constructive and reflective orientations. Strategies focusing on didactic and authentic orientiations are less frequently utilized. Regarding the roles GAI plays as reflected in instructional strategies, it predominantly assumes roles as “New Subject” and “Direct Mediator", with the role of “Supplementary Assistant” yet to be explored. Finally, this study evaluated the instructional application research of GAI from three dimensions: GAI product type and applied discipline, discipline-specific application and integration level, instructional strategies and GAI role, and put forward relevant research suggestions.}

However, smart grids face critical communication bottlenecks due to the ever-increasing volume of data from distributed sensors. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically a type of pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) architecture suitable for time series data due to its efficiency and privacy-preserving properties. These GenAI models are distributed to agents, or data holders, empowering them to fine-tune the foundation model with their local datasets. By fine-tuning the foundation model, the updated model can produce synthetic data that mirrors real-world grid conditions. The server aggregates fine-tuned model from all agents and then generates synthetic data which considers all data collected in the grid. This synthetic data can be used to train global machine learning models for specific tasks like anomaly detection and energy optimization. Then, the trained task models are distributed to agents in the grid to leverage them. The paper highlights the advantages of GenAI for smart grid communication, including reduced communication burden, enhanced privacy through anonymized data transmission, and improved efficiency and scalability. By enabling a distributed and intelligent communication architecture, GenAI introduces a novel way for a more secure, efficient, and sustainable energy future.}

The trend of using AI for co-creation will not spare artists’ creative processes, and it is important to understand how the use of generative AI at different stages of the creative process affects both the evaluation of the artist and the result of the human-machine collaboration (i.e., the visual artifact). In three experiments (N = 560), this research explores how the evaluation of artworks is transformed by the revelation that the artist collaborated with AI at different stages of the creative process. The results show that co-created art is less liked and recognized, especially when AI was used in the implementation stage. While co-created art is perceived as more novel, it lacks creative authenticity, which exerts a dominant influence. The results also show that artists’ perceptions suffer from the co-creation process, and that artists who co-create are less admired because they are perceived as less authentic. Two boundary conditions are identified. The negative effect can be mitigated by disclosing the level of artist involvement in co-creation with AI (e.g., by training the algorithm on a curated set of images vs. simply prompting an off-the-shelf AI image generator). In the context of art that is perceived as commercially motivated (e.g., stock images), the effect is also diminished. This research has important implications for the literature on human-AI-collaboration, research on authenticity, and the ongoing policy debate regarding the transparency of algorithmic presence.}

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have experienced rapid development over the last decade and are gaining increasing popularity as assistive models in academic writing. However, the ability of AI to generate reliable and accurate research articles is a topic of debate. Major scientific journals have issued policies regarding the contribution of AI tools in scientific writing.
Methods
We conducted a review of the author and peer reviewer guidelines of the top 25 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine journals as per the 2023 SCImago rankings. Data were obtained though reviewing journal websites and directly emailing the editorial office. Descriptive data regarding journal characteristics were coded on SPSS. Subgroup analyses of the journal guidelines were conducted based on the publishing company policies.
Results
Our analysis revealed that all scientific journals in our study permitted the documented use of AI in scientific writing with certain limitations as per ICMJE recommendations. We found that AI tools cannot be included in the authorship or be used for image generation, and that all authors are required to assume full responsibility of their submitted and published work. The use of generative AI tools in the peer review process is strictly prohibited.
Conclusion
Guidelines regarding the use of generative AI in scientific writing are standardized, detailed, and unanimously followed by all journals in our study according to the recommendations set forth by international forums. It is imperative to ensure that these policies are carefully followed and updated to maintain scientific integrity.}

How can this ‘generative AI’ be compared with the ‘real’ intelligence of the human brain, when for example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has interesting implications for the further development of generative AI and for neuroscience research.}

We intend to reduce the gap by developing a classification framework that should allow researchers gauge the potential impact of GenAI for social good initiatives. Through case analysis, we assess how value-added abilities of GenAI may influence various social good initiatives. We adopt/develop two loosely connected classification frameworks that are grounded in task-technology fit (TTF) theory. Subsequently, we investigate how our analyses of GenAI initiatives utilizing different dimensions of these two frameworks may be synthesized to provide appropriate explanation for potential success of GenAI for social good.

abstract = {Introduction
Over 90% of pregnant women and 76% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.
Methods
Twenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.
Results
Bard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT’s college level by all scoring metrics (P <0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P <0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85% ± 10) and ChatGPT (87% ± 14) (P=0.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P=0.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22% vs. 9%) than ChatGPT (P=0.007)
Conclusion
Answers to questions about “labor epidurals” should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4th to 6th grade level suggested for patient materials. Consumers, health care providers, hospitals and governmental agencies should be aware of the quality of information generated by chatbots. Chatbots should meet the standards for readability and understandability of health-related questions, to aid public understanding and enhance shared decision-making.}

Despite their increasing use, however, the broader population's perceptions and understandings of Gen-AI-generated images remain understudied in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. This study investigates how individuals, including those unfamiliar with Gen-AI, perceive Gen-AI text-to-image (Stable Diffusion) outputs. Study findings reveal that participants appraise Gen-AI images based on their technical quality and fidelity in representing a subject, often experiencing them as either prototypical or strange: these experiences may raise awareness of societal biases and evoke unsettling feelings that extend to the Gen-AI itself. The study also uncovers several “relational” strategies that participants employ to cope with concerns related to Gen-AI, contributing to the understanding of reactions to uncanny technology and the (de)humanization of intelligent agents. Moreover, the study offers design suggestions on how to use the anthropomorphizing of the text-to-image model as design material, and the Gen-AI images as support for critical design sessions.}

More importantly, it analyses the potentially disruptive impact of this ascendant technology on higher education and the global workplace. The findings of this paper indicate that students pursuing higher education tend to perceive GAI favourably, as it frees them from the toil of rote-learning. However, the view is rather mixed in the case of educators, who are still coming to grips with this seemingly disruptive technology. In the case of the global labour market, GAI has the potential to decimate legions of white-collar jobs once it eliminates inherent issues of biases, security and misinformation. Despite the media’s constant labelling of GAI as a disruptive technology that has suddenly burst onto the technological scene, it is evidenced in this paper that the technology has taken nearly eight decades to reach today’s level of technological advancement. Further, it is far from reaching its full potential, as it is still incorporating advances in pattern recognition, planning and problem solving, and quantum computing technologies. This study also warns of concentrating the power of this game-changing technology in the hands of a few major corporate titans.}

abstract = {Background
General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI.
Objective
This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention.
Methods
We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial.
Results
In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98% accuracy vs 69%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62% and 66%) about AI at the end of the trial.
Conclusions
This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.

While GAI has gained significant attention across various domains, its utility in breast cancer research has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This study aims to fill that gap by synthesizing existing research into a unified document. A comprehensive search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, resulting in the retrieval of 3827 articles, of which 31 were deemed eligible for analysis. The included studies were categorized based on key criteria, such as application types, geographical distribution, contributing organizations, leading journals, publishers, and temporal trends. Keyword co-occurrence mapping and subject profiling further highlighted the major research themes in this field. The findings reveal that GAI models have been applied to improve breast cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome predictions. Geographical and network analyses showed that most contributions come from a few leading institutions, with limited global collaboration. The review also identifies key challenges in implementing GAI in clinical practice, such as data availability, ethical concerns, and model validation. Despite these challenges, the study highlights GAI’s potential to enhance breast cancer research, particularly in generating synthetic data, improving diagnostic accuracy, and personalizing treatment approaches. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and stakeholders, providing insights into current research trends, major contributors, and collaborative networks in GAI-based breast cancer studies. By offering a holistic overview, it aims to support future research directions and encourage broader adoption of GAI technologies in healthcare. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of overcoming implementation barriers to fully realize GAI’s potential in transforming breast cancer management.}

It recommends that guidelines for using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in mental health care must be established promptly. Currently, clinicians using chatbots without appropriate approval risk undermining legal protections for patients. This could harm the patient and undermine the standards of the profession, undermining trust in an area where human involvement in decision-making is critical. To explore these concerns, this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful attention. The impact of the European Union's (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act (AI-Act) is also considered. It will be seen that these laws are insufficient in the context of mental health. As such, the paper recommends that guidelines should be developed to help resolve the existing legal gaps until codified rules are established.}

Respondents reported on their own and colleagues' GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: "GenAI as a work horse", "GenAI as a language assistant only", and "GenAI as a research accelerator". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI's research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer review tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed. The study underscores the need for adaptable, discipline-specific guidelines for GenAI use in research, developed collaboratively with experts to align with diverse research practices and minimize ethical and practical misalignment.}

abstract = {Background
The medical interview remains a cornerstone of clinical training. There is growing interest in applying generative artificial intelligence (AI) in medical education, including medical interview training. However, its utility in culturally and linguistically specific contexts, including Japanese, remains underexplored. This study investigated the utility of generative AI for Japanese medical interview training.
Objective
This pilot study aimed to evaluate the utility of generative AI as a tool for medical interview training by comparing its performance with that of traditional face-to-face training methods using a simulated patient.
Methods
We conducted a randomized crossover pilot study involving 20 postgraduate year 1‐2 physicians from a university hospital. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group A began with an AI-based station on a case involving abdominal pain, followed by a traditional station with a standardized patient presenting chest pain. Group B followed the reverse order, starting with the traditional station for abdominal pain and subsequently within the AI-based station for the chest pain scenario. In the AI-based stations, participants interacted with a GPT-configured platform that simulated patient behaviors. GPTs are customizable versions of ChatGPT adapted for specific purposes. The traditional stations involved face-to-face interviews with a simulated patient. Both groups used identical, standardized case scenarios to ensure uniformity. Two independent evaluators, blinded to the study conditions, assessed participants’ performances using 6 defined metrics: patient care and communication, history taking, physical examination, accuracy and clarity of transcription, clinical reasoning, and patient management. A 6-point Likert scale was used for scoring. The discrepancy between the evaluators was resolved through discussion. To ensure cultural and linguistic authenticity, all interviews and evaluations were conducted in Japanese.
Results
AI-based stations scored lower across most categories, particularly in patient care and communication, than traditional stations (4.48 vs 4.95; P=.009). However, AI-based stations demonstrated comparable performance in clinical reasoning, with a nonsignificant difference (4.43 vs 4.85; P=.10).
Conclusions
The comparable performance of generative AI in clinical reasoning highlights its potential as a complementary tool in medical interview training. One of its main advantages lies in enabling self-learning, allowing trainees to independently practice interviews without the need for simulated patients. Nonetheless, the lower scores in patient care and communication underline the importance of maintaining traditional methods that capture the nuances of human interaction. These findings support the adoption of hybrid training models that combine generative AI with conventional approaches to enhance the overall effectiveness of medical interview training in Japan.

abstract = {Background
Exercise cardiovascular magnetic resonance (Ex-CMR) can reveal pathophysiologies not evident at rest by quantifying biventricular volume and function during or immediately after exercise. However, achieving reproducible Ex-CMR measurements is challenging due to limited spatial and temporal resolution. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a free-breathing, high-spatiotemporal-resolution single-beat Ex-CMR cine enhanced by generative artificial intelligence. We assessed image analysis reproducibility, scan-rescan reproducibility, and impact of the reader's experience on the analysis.
Methods
Imaging was performed on a 3T CMR system using a free-breathing, highly accelerated, multi-slice, single-beat cine sequence (in-plane spatiotemporal resolution of 1.9 × 1.9 mm² and 37 ms, respectively). High acceleration was achieved by combining compressed sensing reconstruction with a resolution-enhancement generative adversarial inline neural network. Ex-CMR was performed using a supine ergometer positioned immediately outside the magnet bore. Single-beat cine images were acquired at rest and immediately post-exercise. In a prospective study, the protocol was evaluated in 141 subjects. A structured image analysis workflow was implemented. Four expert readers, with or without prior training in single-beat Ex-CMR, independently rated all images for diagnostic and image quality. The subjective assessment used two 3-point Likert scales. Biventricular parameters were calculated. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility were assessed. Fifteen healthy subjects were re-imaged 1 year later for scan-rescan reproducibility. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), with agreement evaluated via Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression, and Pearson correlation.
Results
Free-breathing, single-beat Ex-CMR cine enabled imaging of the beating heart within 30 ± 6 s, with technically successful scans in 96% (136/141) of subjects. Post-exercise single-beat cine images were assessed as diagnostic in 98% (133/136), 96% (131/136), 82% (112/136), and 65% (89/136) of cases by four readers (ordered by descending years of Ex-CMR experience). Good image quality was reported in 74% (100/136) to 80% (109/136) of subjects. Biventricular parameters were successfully measured in all subjects, demonstrating good to excellent inter-observer reproducibility. Scan/rescan reproducibility over 1 year, assessed by two independent readers, showed excellent inter-visit ICCs (0.96–1.0) and strong correlations (R² ≥ 0.92, p < 0.001 for left ventricle; R² ≥ 0.95, p < 0.001 for right ventricle).
Conclusion
Single-beat Ex-CMR enabled evaluation of biventricular volumetric and functional indices with excellent reproducibility.}

Using hermeneutic phenomenology as the philosophical underpinning and research methodology, SEA teachers’ ‘lived experiences’ of using ChatGPT and other GenAI tools were uncovered. 38 teachers from 10 SEA countries participated in 11 focus group interviews over five months. Three themes emerged: Learning Anew; Disequilibrium and Lack of Rootedness; and Ambiguity about New Norms, New Practices. It was found that teachers work with GenAI in deeply personal, fragmented, and continuously evolving ways. GenAI took the form of novel work companions, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of some work practices. It also was a disruptor to old habits of thinking, behaviour and practices. Teachers were in a state of disequilibrium in this new world beset by VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity). Some felt overwhelmed and ‘at breaking point’. A lack of rootedness in teachers’ beliefs and practices emerged. Teachers were generally against the notions of plagiarism and academic integrity held by students who believed the ends justified the means. However, with new ways of teaching, learning and assessment, many teachers recognised their beliefs and practices would have to change. Thus, in the absence of detailed AI guidelines, they called for the urgent need to establish boundaries and teach AI literacy to promote innovative and responsible use. In this VUCA world, more targeted change management training for teachers and students was strongly needed.}

abstract = {Background
A substantial cohort of individuals rely on online resources, such as discussion forums, for support on tapering antidepressants. This study aimed to assess the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in responding to clinical queries on tapering antidepressants.
Methods
Ten queries on tapering antidepressants were developed based on previous research, prescribing guidelines, and online peer support forums. Queries covered areas including reasons for discontinuing antidepressants, tapering methods, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse. Each query was submitted to ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) using the GPT-4 model as an independent standalone query using standardised prompts. Responses were evaluated in terms of relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity by two researchers working independently.
Results
GPT-4 responses to all tapering queries were considered relevant and within scope. Most responses (8/10) incorporated safety netting by emphasising the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before making any medication changes. The overall accuracy, completeness, and clarity of responses compared less favourably. The response to a query on hyperbolic tapering had the least favourable assessment. This was due to inaccuracies as the response incorrectly referred to logarithmic reductions and provided inaccurate examples of fixed dosage reductions. Several instances of AI hallucinations were identified, including fabricated references.
Conclusion
Generative AI is having a transformative impact on healthcare, including how healthcare professionals and patients access information about clinical queries, such as antidepressant tapering. The study findings show that GPT-4 was able to provide relevant and safety-conscious responses on antidepressant tapering. However, performance issues such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies in tapering recommendations highlight the important role that healthcare professionals continue to play in providing patients with clinically trained, professional support in safely managing health-related issues. Further research on developing AI evaluation tools is needed to ensure consistency in the approaches used in evaluating the performance of AI in addressing clinical queries.}

abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, aging infrastructure demands more advanced inspection methods for structural health monitoring. The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating multi-modal generative AI to enhance human–computer interaction in support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation, image restoration, damage inspection, and human–computer interaction in structural health monitoring.}

abstract = {Objective
The current study assessed pharmacy students' perceptions about generative AI before and after participation in a ChatGPT-based drug information activity.
Methods
In 2024, students at three colleges of pharmacy completed a baseline and post-activity survey on their perceptions of ChatGPT including its reliability, usefulness, and impact on academic performance and critical thinking. The survey was modified from the TAME-ChatGPT assessment and used a 5-point Likert scale. After the baseline survey, students answered clinically relevant drug information questions on their own using primary or tertiary resources and compared their answers with ChatGPT responses. Independent t-test samples were used to compare baseline and post-activity surveys.
Results
A total of 227 students completed the pre-survey and 203 students completed the post-survey. Students' concerns about the reliability of ChatGPT increased after completing the drug information activity (pre-survey: 3.57 ± 0.96; post-survey: 3.88 ± 1.11; p = 0.002). Students' concerns about reliance on ChatGPT and prevention of critical thinking increased (pre-survey: 3.30 ± 1.34; post-survey: 3.57 ± 1.21; p = 0.031). The following areas decreased after the activity: enthusiasm about ChatGPT as learning and research tool (pre-survey: 3.60 ± 1.02; post-survey: 3.32 ± 1.18; p = 0.008), viewing ChatGPT as an important tool for academic success (pre-survey: 3.40 ± 1.13; post-survey: 3.12 ± 1.23; p = 0.015), and concern regarding being accused of plagiarism when using ChatGPT(pre-survey: 4.12 ± 0.96; post-survey: 3.91 ± 1.10; p = 0.031). Open-ended responses revealed that students largely perceived ChatGPT as unreliable for drug information, citing concerns about accuracy and outdated content. However, some students noted its potential usefulness for non-clinical tasks such as generating ideas, organizing content, or providing general overviews.
Conclusion
After a hands-on ChatGPT-based drug information activity, pharmacy students reported increased concerns about reliability and over-reliance on artificial intelligence-based technology. The results of this study may encourage pharmacy educators to implement classroom activities for active exploration of the benefits and challenges of generative AI.
Contribution to literature
Limited published data describes pharmacy student perceptions of artificial intelligence platforms as a drug information source. There is even less literature with pre- and post-data after implementing an activity in which students gain hands-on experience critiquing an artificial intelligence platform response. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate student perceptions after using ChatGPT in the classroom and comparing its performance to their own responses based on information from primary and tertiary literature. The results demonstrate that despite enthusiasm before using ChatGPT, concerns for reliability and hindering thinking increased after a observing the limitations of its performance in answering drug information questions.}

abstract = {The production of modern semiconductor chips is susceptible to variations in air temperature, humidity, and quality, mainly as chip dimensions shrink to smaller than atmospheric dust particles. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are critical in this context, given their role in stabilizing these environmental factors. Gaps in Design and Construction (D&C) can critically undermine the reliability, performance, quality, and lifespan of HVAC systems during their Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages. Current studies illustrate how existing models predicted performance degradation and how the Design, Construction, Operations, and Maintenance (DCOM) gap arises. Despite the substantial implications for Semiconductor Manufacturing Facilities (SMFs), research on HVAC performance degradation remains limited, particularly in capturing and quantifying degradation-related patterns. Compared to other types of buildings, the renovation and transformation of high-end manufacturing facilities are more frequent, and customized design and equipment also lead to model application issues, such as data limitations and incompatibility. This paper aims to propose a novel HVAC system degradation prediction model utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Informer algorithms based on the building characteristics and operation mode of semiconductor facilities to overcome the limitations of data scarcity and long-term prediction, evaluate the comprehensive impact of the gap between D&C and O&M stages on HVAC systems. By integrating data augmentation, this model reduces data dependency and can handle incomplete, inconsistent, or discrete data for early prediction in operation, bridging the gap between D&C and O&M stages, and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of facility operation and maintenance. In addition to SMFs, the proposed model exhibits considerable application potential in other high-precision building types due to the structural variability.}

However, many teacher training programs struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge to real-world applications. The current study tackles this challenge by developing a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-enhanced simulation to improve preservice teachers’ problem-solving abilities. Using design-based research (DBR), we created a virtual environment that integrates problem-based learning (PBL) with GenAI technology. The simulation was rigorously refined through expert review and usability testing before being implemented in a teacher training program. We evaluated its effectiveness by comparing three groups: (1) a text-based scenario, (2) a rule-based simulation, and (3) a GenAI-enhanced simulation. Pre- and post-test results showed significant improvements in problem-solving skills for both the rule-based and GenAI-enhanced simulation groups compared to the text-based scenario group. Notably, qualitative findings revealed that students reported heightened realism and immersion in the GenAI-enhanced simulation, attributing this to more dynamic interactions with AI agents that helped them better contextualize PBL and increased their motivation. Our study findings contribute design principles for developing GenAI-enhanced simulations in teacher education, offering promising insights into leveraging AI technology to create more engaging and effective training experiences.}

Recently, there has been a surge in the development of this technology. However, existing deep learning-based design methods for shear wall structures suffer from poor quality and usability issues. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent design and optimization system for shear wall structures based on large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI). The system employs an LLM as the core controller, which interacts with engineers to interpret their language descriptions and translate them into executable computer code. Subsequently, the system utilizes the corresponding structural generation and optimization methods to accomplish intelligent design tasks automatically. Furthermore, the system incorporates such critical factors as the empirical rules, mechanical performance, and material consumption into the structural optimization process. A unique three-level, two-stage optimization method is constructed based on topology, pattern, and size to enhance the overall design quality. Being able to complete the entire workflow of architectural drawing processing, structural scheme generation, and analysis model establishment, the proposed system enables automated and efficient design of shear wall structures. Through the analysis and validation of multiple cases, it was demonstrated that this system can significantly speed up the design by approximately 30 times compared to that of traditional methods whilst ensuring the safety and cost-effectiveness of the design schemes. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights for the advancement of automated structural design undertakings.}

This study proposed an inverse design method that combines bidirectional generative adversarial networks (BiGAN) and mechanical performance targets, resulting in a combined TPMS structure of Primitive and IWP types with superior buffering and energy absorption capabilities. The results show that under a single load value target condition of the designed structure, the minimum deviation index (R2) between the load value corresponding to the displacement point and the target load value is only 0.987, and the maximum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 5.92 %. When considering the elastic modulus target, the approach successfully conducts two sets of combined structural designs meeting the requirements of both high and low elastic moduli. When targeting the specified load-displacement curve conditions, specifically when combining high elastic modulus with ascending plasticity, the designed structures exhibit an error of only 2.2 % compared to the target property. Moreover, the quasi-static uniaxial compression experiments conducted on additively manufactured designed structures confirm that the experimental curves match the target curves in terms of deformation trends and load value ranges. The success of this inverse design approach for cellular TPMS structures has the potential to expedite new structural material development processes.}

abstract = {Introduction
The emergence and application of generative artificial intelligence/large language models (hereafter GenAI LLMs) have the potential for significant impact on the healthcare industry. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on GenAI LLMs in healthcare based on reliable data. This article aims to conduct an exploratory study of the application of GenAI LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in healthcare from the perspective of digital media (i.e., online news), including the application scenarios, potential opportunities, and challenges.
Methods
This research used thematic qualitative text analysis in five steps: firstly, developing main topical categories based on relevant articles; secondly, encoding the search keywords using these categories; thirdly, conducting searches for news articles via Google ; fourthly, encoding the sub-categories using the elaborate category system; and finally, conducting category-based analysis and presenting the results. Natural language processing techniques, including the TermRaider and AntConc tool, were applied in the aforementioned steps to assist in text qualitative analysis. Additionally, this study built a framework, using for analyzing the above three topics, from the perspective of five different stakeholders, including healthcare demanders and providers.
Results
This study summarizes 26 applications (e.g., provide medical advice, provide diagnosis and triage recommendations, provide mental health support, etc.), 21 opportunities (e.g., make healthcare more accessible, reduce healthcare costs, improve patients care, etc.), and 17 challenges (e.g., generate inaccurate/misleading/wrong answers, raise privacy concerns, lack of transparency, etc.), and analyzes the reasons for the formation of these key items and the links between the three research topics.
Conclusions
The application of GenAI LLMs in healthcare is primarily focused on transforming the way healthcare demanders access medical services (i.e., making it more intelligent, refined, and humane) and optimizing the processes through which healthcare providers offer medical services (i.e., simplifying, ensuring timeliness, and reducing errors). As the application becomes more widespread and deepens, GenAI LLMs is expected to have a revolutionary impact on traditional healthcare service models, but it also inevitably raises ethical and security concerns. Furthermore, GenAI LLMs applied in healthcare is still in the initial stage, which can be accelerated from a specific healthcare field (e.g., mental health) or a specific mechanism (e.g., GenAI LLMs’ economic benefits allocation mechanism applied to healthcare) with empirical or clinical research.}

abstract = {Aim
The aim of this paper is to investigate the incorporation of visual narratives, such as comics and graphics, into nursing education using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models like DALL-E.
Background
Visual narratives serve as a powerful method for communicating intricate concepts in nursing education. Despite their advantages, challenges in creating effective educational comics persist due to the need for expertise in graphic design and the associated time and resource constraints.
Design
This study examines existing literature that highlights the efficacy of visual narratives in education and demonstrates the potential of GAI models, specifically DALL-E, in creating visual narratives for nursing education.
Methods
We analyze the potential of GAI models, specifically DALL-E, to create visual narratives for educational purposes. This was demonstrated through illustrative examples addressing sensitive topics, illustrating research methodology and designing recruitment posters for clinical trials. Additionally, we discussed the necessity of reviewing and editing the text generated by DALL-E to ensure its accuracy and relevance in educational contexts. The method also considered legal concerns related to copyright and ownership of the generated content, highlighting the evolving legal landscape in this domain.
Results
The study found that GAI, specifically DALL-E, has significant potential to bridge the gap in creating visual narratives for nursing education. While offering cost-effectiveness and accessibility, GAI tools require careful consideration of challenges such as text-related errors, misinterpretation of user prompts and legal concerns.
Conclusions
GAI models like DALL-E offer promising solutions for enhancing visual storytelling in nursing education. However, their effective integration requires a collaborative approach, where educators engage with these tools as co-pilots, leveraging their capabilities while mitigating potential drawbacks. By doing so, educators can harness the full potential of GAI to enrich the educational experience for learners through compelling visual narratives.}

Moreover, energy operators are also facing a significant undertaking: how to best use and secure large amounts of data that promote sustainable productivity performance and minimise potential threats in the oil and gas value chain and project operations. In view of the foregoing, various facets like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) are increasingly gaining popularity within oil and gas sector operations. Thus, we explored how GAI and ML algorithms can enhance oil and gas value chain productivity performance. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to identify significant GAI and MLA variables influencing performance in the oil and gas value chain, while Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test regression equations related to their application. The study found that risk portfolios and profiles can be appraised throughout the value chain by effectively utilising GAI and ML algorithms in upstream, midstream and downstream undertakings. While these findings are noteworthy and have significant implications for current practice, the paper advocates that an array of digital technologies beyond GAI and ML can still be examined during future studies to demonstrate a holistic perspective on how digital transformation can be achieved across the energy sector value and project operations.}

abstract = {This study demonstrates a successful use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in teaching mathematical material to management students. We herein introduce the EOQ World Tour game, which substantially improves understanding of inventory-related concepts and long-term knowledge retention compared with traditional methods. Generative AI is revolutionizing management education, by offering innovative methods for teaching and learning. The integration of AI into quantitative business disciplines through novel learning mechanisms provides significant benefits, including enhanced data analysis, improved decision-making models, and sophisticated simulations for hands-on experience. This study introduces the EOQ World Tour game, specifically designed to teach the Economic Order Quantity concept in Operations Management. The game addresses challenges in integrating Generative AI into mathematics in management education by combining human oversight and instructor control through three innovative features: (1) a Generative AI-based simulation, (2) a macropowered Excel worksheet for validating the calculations of an AI chatbot, and (3) a Google Sheets dashboard for centralizing team-generated AI data for postgame analysis. Our study included 41 students divided into experimental and control groups. Pretest results indicated no significant differences in baseline knowledge. However, the post-test results showed that the experimental group achieved a better understanding of inventory-related concepts and practical applications, along with higher engagement, excitement, confidence, and long-term knowledge retention.}

abstract = {The rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine has prompted medical professionals to increasingly familiarize themselves with related topics. This also demands grasping the underlying statistical principles that govern their design, validation, and reproducibility. Uniquely, the practice of pathology and medicine produces vast amount of data that can be exploited by AI/ML. The emergence of generative AI, especially in the area of large language models and multimodal frameworks, represents approaches that are starting to transform medicine. Fundamentally, generative and traditional (eg, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML techniques rely on certain common statistical measures to function. However, unique to generative AI are metrics such as, but not limited to, perplexity and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score that provide a means to determine the quality of generated samples that are typically unfamiliar to most medical practitioners. In contrast, nongenerative predictive analytics ML often uses more familiar metrics tailored to specific tasks as seen in the typical classification (ie, confusion metrics measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) or regression studies (ie, root mean square error and R2). To this end, the goal of this review article (as part 4 of our AI review series) is to provide an overview and a comparative measure of statistical measures and methodologies used in both generative AI and traditional (ie, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML fields along with their strengths and known limitations. By understanding their similarities and differences along with their respective applications, we will become better stewards of this transformative space, which ultimately enables us to better address our current and future needs and challenges in a more responsible and scientifically sound manner.}

abstract = {With the commercialization of ChatGPT, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied almost everywhere in our lives. However, even though generative AI has become a daily technology that anyone can use, most non-majors need to know the process and reason for the results because it can be misused due to lack of sufficient knowledge and misunderstanding. Therefore, this study investigated users’ preferences for when, what, and how generative AI should provide explanations about the process of generating and the reasoning behind the results, using conjoint method and mixed logit analysis. The results show that users are most sensitive to the timing of providing eXplainable AI (XAI), and that users want additional information only when they ask for explanations during the process of using generative AI. The results of this study will help shape the XAI design of future generative AI from a user perspective and improve usability.}

abstract = {Catalysis has made great contributions to the productivity of human society. Therefore, the pursuit of new catalysts and research on catalytic processes has never stopped. Continuous and in-depth catalysis research significantly increases the complexity of dynamic systems and multivariate optimization, thus posing higher challenges to research methodologies. Recently, the significant advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides new opportunities for catalysis research. Different from traditional discriminative AI, this state-of-the-art technique generates new samples based on existing data and accumulated knowledge, which endows it with attractive potential for catalysis research — a field featuring a vast exploration space, diverse data types and complex mapping relationships. Generative AI can greatly enhance both the efficiency and innovation capacity of catalysis research, subsequently fostering new scientific paradigms. This perspective covers the basic introduction, unique advantages of this powerful tool, and presents cases of generative AI implemented in various catalysis researches, including catalyst design and optimization, characterization technique enhancement and guidance for new research paradigms. These examples highlight its exceptional efficiency and general applicability. We further discuss the practical challenges in implementation and future development perspectives, ultimately aiming to promote better applications of generative AI in catalysis.}

Unlike other educational technologies that can be tracked when used, ChatGPT has superior abilities that make it virtually untraceable when used. This creates a dilemma for management educators wanting to utilise the technology whilst staying relevant but also interested in authentic learning. Thus, it is critical for management educators to quickly implement policies regarding ChatGPT and subsequent new generative artificial intelligence because of its ease of use and affordability. This article is conceptual in nature and discusses ChatGPT as a generative form of artificial intelligence that presents challenges for management educators that need to be addressed through appropriate strategies. Thereby contributing to the literature on how technological innovations can be included in curriculum design and management learning practices. Practical and managerial implications are stated that highlight the critical need to re-examine existing education practices as a way of incorporating new technological innovation that can be utilised in a beneficial way.}

However, studies on how to enhance immersive game-based learning with AI and VR technologies remain scant. Given this, the article presents the creation of “LearningverseVR,” an immersive game-based learning platform developed using generative AI and VR technologies, which is based on “Learningverse,” a metaverse platform developed by the lead author and her research team. The “LearningverseVR” platform uses Unity as the client and Python, Flask and MySQL as the backend. Unity's multiplayer service provides multiplayer online functionality, supporting learners to engage in immersive and interactive learning activities. The design framework of the platform consists of two main components: Game-based learning with generative AI and immersion with VR technologies. First, generative AI is used to create NPCs with diverse personalities and life backgrounds, and enable learners to interact with NPCs without scripted dialogues, creating an interactive and immersive game-based learning environment. Secondly, such a learning experience is enhanced by leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) ecosystem with VR technology. The creation of the “LearningverseVR” platform provides novel perspectives on digital game-based learning.}

abstract = {Performance-based fire safety design requires thoroughly evaluating building fire scenarios to ensure comprehensive fire safety. However, conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) fire simulations are computationally intensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of scenarios that can be practically analyzed. This study addresses these challenges by using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to predict fire scenes in realistic multi-room building layouts, characterized by complex shapes and intricate wall partitions. Three generative AI models for image generation are employed for this purpose: GAN-based pix2pix and pix2pixHD, as well as the diffusion model. These models were trained on an extensive dataset of CFD fire simulations to generate near-ceiling smoke movement and temperature distribution outcomes. When tested on new unseen building layouts, these models demonstrated remarkable accuracy and provided near real-time assessments. The diffusion model achieved the highest accuracy (>94 %) while requiring the more computational time. The high performance of these models highlights the potential of using generative AI to enhance fire safety engineering by enabling faster and more comprehensive fire risk assessments.}
