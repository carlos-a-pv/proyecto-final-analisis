abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are being rapidly adopted for many activities in organizations, business, and education. Included in their applications are capabilities to generate text, code, and models. This leads to questions about their potential role in the conceptual modeling part of information systems development. This paper reports on a panel presented at the 43rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling where researchers discussed the current and potential role of LLMs in conceptual modeling. The panelists discussed applications and interest levels and expressed both optimism and caution in the adoption of LLMs. Suggested is a need for much continued research by the conceptual modeling community on LLM development and their role in research and teaching.}

Herein, we synthesized g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst by modifying g-C3N4 using V2C MXene. The prepared photocatalyst exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance under visible light. The degradation efficiency of methyl orange by g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst was as high as 94.5%, which is 1.56 times higher than that by g-C3N4. This was attributed to the V2C MXene inhibiting the rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers and facilitating rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons (e−) from g-C3N4 to MXene. Moreover, g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst showed good cycling stability. The photocatalytic performance was higher than 85% after three cycles. Experiments to capture free radicals revealed that superoxide radicals (·O2−) are the main contributors to the photocatalytic activity. Thus, the proposed g-C3N4@V2C MXene photocatalyst is a promising visible-light catalyst.}

abstract = {This study proposes a pattern-free layout method for continuous generation and optimization of heliostat positions based on optical efficiency. Using annual weighted cosine efficiency as the objective function, the initial layout is generated through a continuous search from the optimal point of the entire field. This is followed by a secondary optimization and selection of all heliostats based on annual weighted optical efficiency. Points with efficiency above the threshold are retained, while low-efficiency points are discarded and re-entered into the search optimization until all eligible heliostat positions are identified, ultimately resulting in a highly efficient heliostat field. The efficiency improvement from the generative pattern-free layout optimization is primarily attributed to the initial search using annual weighted cosine efficiency, which enhances the annual weighted cosine efficiency of the field, and the secondary screening optimization, which improves shading and blocking efficiency. Compared to the original PS10 heliostat field, the annual weighted efficiency increased by 1.77%. Finally, two clustering-based pattern-free layout methods are proposed. The total distance from all points within a K-means cluster to the reference center is 58,238.1974 m, a reduction of 71.18% compared to the untreated original heliostat field. The method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model reduces the distance to the reference center by 66.90%. Classification based on optical efficiency reflects the overall distribution structure of the heliostat field’s optical efficiency, reducing the layout difficulty of pattern-free heliostat fields and providing feasibility for transforming theoretical research into practical engineering applications.}

abstract = {The polyvagal collection of hypotheses is based upon five essential premises, as stated by its author (Porges, 2011). Polyvagal conjectures rest on a primary assumption that brainstem ventral and dorsal vagal regions in mammals each have their own unique mediating effects upon control of heart rate. The polyvagal hypotheses link these putative dorsal- vs. ventral-vagal differences to socioemotional behavior (e.g. defensive immobilization, and social affiliative behaviors, respectively), as well as to trends in the evolution of the vagus nerve (e.g. Porges, 2011 & 2021a). Additionally, it is essential to note that only one measurable phenomenon—as index of vagal processes—serves as the linchpin for virtually every premise. That phenomenon is respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), heart-rate changes coordinated to phase of respiration (i.e. inspiration vs. expiration), often employed as an index of vagally, or parasympathetically, mediated control of heart rate. The polyvagal hypotheses assume that RSA is a mammalian phenomenon, since Porges (2011) states “RSA has not been observed in reptiles.” I will here briefly document how each of these basic premises have been shown to be either untenable or highly implausible based on the available scientific literature. I will also argue that the polyvagal reliance upon RSA as equivalent to general vagal tone or even cardiac vagal tone is conceptually a category mistake (Ryle, 1949), confusing an approximate index (i.e. RSA) of a phenomenon (some general vagal process) with the phenomenon, itself.}

abstract = {In sludge dewatering of most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the dose of polymer flocculant is manually adjusted through direct visual inspection of the flocs without the aid of any instruments. Although there is a demand for the development of automatic control of flocculant dosing, this has been challenging owing to the lack of a reliable flocculation sensor. To address this issue, this study developed a novel image sensor for measuring the degree of flocculation (DF) based on deep learning. Two types of sludge samples were used in the laboratory-scale flocculation tests: excess sludge and mixtures of excess sludge and raw wastewater. To search for a deep learning regression model suitable for DF inference, ten models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and a multilayer perceptron MLP mixer, were comparatively analysed. The ConvNeXt and MLP mixer models showed the highest accuracies with coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.9. The region contributing to the DF inference in the flocculation images was visualised using a modulus-weighted, gradient-weighted regression activation map. A prototype of the flocculation sensor was constructed using an inexpensive EdgeAI device. This device comprises a single-board computer and an integrated graphical processing unit (GPU) and is equipped with a quantised ConvNeXt model. The maximum inference speed of the sensor was 12.8 frames per second (FPS). The flocculation control tests showed that the sensor could control the DF to the target value by adjusting the polymer flocculant dose. Therefore, the flocculation sensor can provide a data-driven approach to the management of the flocculation process, thereby facilitating the automation of WWTPs.}

The interaction of five homonuclear diatomic gases, Cl2, F2, H2, N2 and O2, with several pure metals are examined using Coulomb's law to calculate the attractive and repulsive forces between the electrons or ions in the gas molecule and the free surface metallic electrons or ions assuming a Bohr model. These calculations demonstrate that the total energy of the electrostatic fields from the metals can exceed the molecular binding energies of Cl2, F2, and O2 at some distance from the metallic surface thereby suggesting that these gases interact primarily with the metallic surface in their atomic states after molecular bond dissociation prior to reaction. In contrast, H2 and N2 gases do not dissociate prior to reaching the metal surface due to the fact that the effective charge of the gas ions is less than the total electron charge at the outermost electronic shell. The present results correlate linearly with the electrochemical series standard reduction potential as well as with the Pauling electronegativity for several metals.}

Two elastically bent mirror (EBM) modules, each of which is composed of an elastically bent mirror and a loading mechanism, are integrated into a non-orthogonal two-axis Lloyd's mirror interferometer. The deflections of the X- and Y-EBMs can generate nonlinear components in the wavefronts of the X- and Y-beams, resulting in a stationary interference fringe field with variable pitches along the X- and Y-directions, respectively. The pitch specifications (the center pitch and the pitch variation range) of the grating can be adjusted by changing the corresponding module parameters (the tilt angle and the applied load). Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that for EMBs with a dimension of 450 mm (length) × 250 (width) × 2 mm (thickness), the center pitch can be linearly adjusted within the range of 680 nm–1290 nm with respect to a tilt angle range of 10°, while the pitch variation range is independently adjustable from 60 nm to 130 nm with respect to an applied load range of 8 N. Two-axis VLS grating structures with a center pitch of 1000 nm and a pitch variation of ±45 nm are successfully fabricated over a fabrication area of 100 mm × 100 mm, which demonstrates the feasibility of the developed system.}

As open pits, sandboxes in New York City public playgrounds are potentially exposed to fecal inputs from various sources, including wild and domestic animals. A longitudinal study of thirteen sandboxes located in public playgrounds on the east side of Manhattan reveals ubiquity of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci and Escherichia coli through all seasons. The highest concentrations of bacteria occur in surface sand (n = 42; mean enterococci 230 MPN/g and E. coli 182 MPN/g dry weight), with significantly lower levels at depths below the surface (n = 35; mean enterococci 21 MPN/g and E. coli 12 MPN/g dry weight), a stratification consistent with fecal loading at the surface. Generalized linear mixed models indicate that sand depth (surface vs. underlayers) is the most influential variable affecting bacterial levels (P <0.001 for both enterococci and E. coli), followed by sampling season (P <0.001 for both). Bacterial concentrations do not vary significantly as a function of playground location or ZIP code within the study area. Children’s exposure while playing in sandboxes likely reaches 105 enterococci and 104 E. coli in a typical play period. Microbial source tracking to identify fecal hosts reveals dog, bird, and human biomarkers in low concentrations. Open sandbox microcosms installed at ground level in the urban environment of Manhattan are fouled by enterococci and E. coli within two weeks, while adjacent closed microcosms exhibit no fecal contamination over a 33-day sampling period. Collectively, our results indicate that increasing the frequency of sand refills and covering sandboxes during times of disuse would be straightforward management strategies to mitigate fecal contamination in playground sandboxes.}

Traditional studies on road network vulnerability have primarily focussed on physical attacks like node or link removal, with little attention to disinformation attacks. To fill this gap, this study introduces a novel disinformation attack mode for road TCPS. It hacks navigation applications by strategically modifying the link cost information, thereby affecting drivers' routing decisions. Crucially, this attack mode leaves the physical topology of TCPS-based road networks unchanged, impacting only the cyber layer's information. Additionally, intriguing link metrics, like the partial derivative of total travel time to link flow, are introduced to identify attack targets. On this basis, we design multi-strategy disinformation attacks to assess road network vulnerability. The proposed research framework, validated by San Francisco's large-scale urban road network, reveals that disinformation attacks on just 0.12% of links could cause an annual city-wide economic loss of $79.26 million in the worst-case scenario. This study offers a unique viewpoint on road network vulnerability, emphasising the vital need for TCPS cybersecurity to ensure urban transportation's reliability and resilience.}

However, an important caveat in this approach lies in the lack of reference data, limiting the possibility of developing acoustic biodiversity indices and assessing their sensitivity to environmental change. To address this issue, previous studies have attempted to generate “engineered soundscapes”, that is artificial soundscape recordings which offer some control on, among other aspects, species diversity. Unfortunately, these tools lack complexity and realism, limiting their ecological validity. Here, we introduce Evascape, a Python algorithm informed by available knowledge in soundscape ecology aiming at producing assembled soundscapes with high ecological validity. The algorithm offers the possibility to control biophony (number of species, number of individuals, time organization), geophony (wind and rain with adjustable level), anthropophony (aircraft noise) and sound propagation effects (frequency-dependent attenuation function of the habitat). The algorithm was tested using an acoustic database collected in a protected European cold forest. The generated assembled soundscapes were then used to assess a selection of commonly-used ecoacoustic indices across a large number of controlled scenarios, and to identify the indices that respond most strongly to changes in species richness. Evascape opens the path to other ecoacoustics-related research programs, offering the possibility to design empirical and computational experiments with controlled soundscape parameters.}

abstract = {Background
An increasing number of users are turning to web-based sources as an important source of health care guidance information. Thus, trustworthy sources of information should be automatically identifiable using objective criteria.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to automate the assessment of the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) criteria, enhancing our ability to pinpoint trustworthy health information sources.
Methods
A data set of 538 web pages displaying health content was collected from 43 health-related websites. HONcode criteria have been considered as web page and website levels. For the website-level criteria (confidentiality, transparency, financial disclosure, and advertising policy), a bag of keywords has been identified to assess the criteria using a rule-based model. For the web page–level criteria (authority, complementarity, justifiability, and attribution) several machine learning (ML) approaches were used. In total, 200 web pages were manually annotated until achieving a balanced representation in terms of frequency. In total, 3 ML models—random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)—were trained on the initial annotated data. A second step of training was implemented for the complementarity criterion using the BERT model for multiclass classification of the complementarity sentences obtained by annotation and data augmentation (positive, negative, and noncommittal sentences). Finally, the remaining web pages were classified using the selected model and 100 sentences were randomly selected for manual review.
Results
For web page–level criteria, the random forest model showed a good performance for the attribution criterion while displaying subpar performance in the others. BERT and SVM had a stable performance across all the criteria. BERT had a better area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, 0.98, and 1.00 for neutral sentences, justifiability, and attribution, respectively. SVM had the overall better performance for the classification of complementarity with the AUC equal to 0.98. Finally, SVM and BERT had an equal AUC of 0.98 for the authority criterion. For the website level criteria, the rule-based model was able to retrieve web pages with an accuracy of 0.97 for confidentiality, 0.82 for transparency, and 0.51 for both financial disclosure and advertising policy. The final evaluation of the sentences determined 0.88 of precision and the agreement level of reviewers was computed at 0.82.
Conclusions
Our results showed the potential power of automating the HONcode criteria assessment using ML approaches. This approach could be used with different types of pretrained models to accelerate the text annotation, and classification and to improve the performance in low-resource cases. Further work needs to be conducted to determine how to assign different weights to the criteria, as well as to identify additional characteristics that should be considered for consolidating these criteria into a comprehensive reliability score.}

Some content quickly reaches considerable popularity because it is accessed and shared on a large scale, especially in social networks, thus having a potential for going viral. Thus, this study aimed to identify the algorithms and software used for fake news detection. The choice for this combination is justified because in Brazil this process is carried out manually by verification agencies and thus, based on the mapping of the algorithms identified in the literature, an architecture proposal will be developed using artificial intelligence. As a methodology, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in the Science Direct and Scopus databases using the keywords "fake news" and "machine learning" to locate reviews and research articles published in Engineering fields from 2018 to 2023.

This study, therefore, investigates whether the use of generative AI tools could help student authors construct a more consistent voice in multimodal writing. In this study, we have designed a photo essay assignment where students recount a story in the form of photo essays and prompt AI image-generating tools to create photos for their storytelling. Drawing on interview data, written reflections, written annotations, and multimodal products from seven focal participants, we have identified two remixing practices–layering and blending–through which students attempted to establish a coherent and unique voice in writing. The study sheds light on the intentional and discursive nature of multimodal writing with AI as afforded by the technological flexibility, while also highlighting the practical and ethical challenges that could be attributed to students’ insufficient prompt and multimodal literacy and the innate limitations of AI systems. This study provides important implications for incorporating AI tools in designing multimodal writing tasks.}

While much of the existing research emphasizes the challenges GenAI presents to employees as individuals, this study shifts the focus to explore broader organizational risks, particularly unethical workplace behaviors. Drawing on human-AI collaboration research and the job demands-resources model, we develop and empirically test a novel model to explain how and when employee-GenAI collaboration may lead to employees’ unethical behavioral outcomes in daily organizational contexts. Using an experience sampling approach with longitudinal data from 229 service industry employees, encompassing 1050 matched daily observations, our findings reveal that employee-GenAI collaboration increases work alienation—a sense of disconnection from work—which, in turn, drives employee expediency that compromises work standards. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this effect is pronounced under high digital job demands. By highlighting this unintended consequence, our study contributes to theoretical advancements in understanding the darker side of employee-GenAI collaboration and provides practical insights to help organizations harness the benefits of GenAI while mitigating its potential ethical pitfalls.}

abstract = {Improving therapeutic efficacy of newly developed drugs remains a major challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Spray drying based on atomization using high pressure or supercritical CO2 has been shown to be effective in improving therapeutic efficiency of drugs by forming smaller particles, owing to the distinct solvation power and enhanced mixing potential of supercritical CO2. Several parameters contribute to the critical quality attributes of the final atomized pharmaceutical products resulting from CO2-assisted atomization including high-pressure nozzle design, drying chamber geometry, and operating pressures and temperatures. In this context, the work is focused on a detailed analysis of supercritical CO2 through micro-orifices used in a spray drying enhanced atomization process. We present a computational fluid dynamics model, developed using Ansys FLUENT, to describe the flow of pure, pressurized CO2 through a micro-orifice undergoing trans-critical expansion. After establishing grid independence, the computational model was validated by comparing model predictions to measured mass flow rates and temperature distribution of the cooling effect of CO2 free jet over an adiabatic surface. For supercritical inlet conditions and a nozzle orifice size of 80 µm, experimental results matched predictions reasonably well. The simulated results demonstrated the occurrence of shock waves, a prerequisite for fine droplets formation. Simulated results were critically analyzed to develop new insights into intricate fluid dynamics of flow of CO2 through atomization orifices and an attempt is made to evolve specific guidelines. The presented model and results will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in understanding and optimizing CO2-assisted spray atomization processes.}

It plays a role in regulating melanin changes and rhythmic behaviors such as sleep and feeding, though its relationship with these processes is not fully understood. Our preliminary research revealed significant differences in melanin degradation in zebrafish under varying light conditions, suggesting a link to MCH. This study aims to explore MCH's role in lighting-induced changes in rhythmic behavior patterns and melanin of zebrafish. Using the zebrafish model, we evaluated MCH expression under different lighting conditions and analyzed the effects of arousal-promoting and sleep-inducing agents. We also investigated the impact of exogenous MCH and its inhibitors on melanin degradation, behavioral changes, and differences in MCH expression to uncover potential regulatory relationships between MCH, sleep pressure, and melanin. In-depth research using flow cytometry, acridine orange staining, LysoTracker Red staining, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of autophagy- and apoptosis-related genes showed that melanin degradation regulation depends on MCH expression levels. Sleep pressure can intervene in MCH's effects, forming a regulatory loop to jointly regulate melanin degradation. The influence of the MCH-sleep pressure loop on melanin degradation is closely tied to autophagic and lysosomal pathways. Our findings reveal a mutually regulatory loop in zebrafish between MCH and sleep pressure, affecting melanin degradation through these pathways.}

The local water supplies of the three study DACs, located in Salinas Valley, California, were contaminated with nitrate at levels (∼ 12–87 mg/L NO3−−N) above the California maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mg/L NO3−−N, and had elevated water salinity (∼600–1,600 mg/L total dissolved solids(TDS)) above its secondary MCL (SMCL) of 500 mg/L TDS. Well water nitrate removal and salinity reduction were accomplished via reverse osmosis (RO) based DWTD systems that operated autonomously, supported by remote monitoring and supervisory cyberinfrastructure. Reliable DWTD operation provided treated water quality, with respect to nitrate and salinity, in the range of 0.5–6.3 mg/L NO3−−N and 57–161 mg/L TDS, respectively, which were well below the respective MCL and SMCL. The levelized cost of water treatment was in the range of ∼$2/m3- $2.9/m3 which aligns with typical residential water costs in California and in the study region, and monthly residential water costs ($39-$74/residential unit/month) were also within the range in California. The study showcased the DWTD approach as a viable and potentially scalable solution for upgrading impaired local potable water supply of communities lacking centralized water delivery infrastructure. However, streamlined permitting processes and standardized regulatory frameworks are critical to promoting wider adoption and maximizing the socio-economic benefits of the DWT approach. Moreover, DACs are likely to require government subsidies in order to cover the CapEx of DWTD systems in addition to upgrade of site infrastructure.}

abstract = {Context:
Test-Driven Development (TDD ) is an agile development approach where the writing of unit tests precedes the writing of production code. Some software engineers have been advocating the use of TDD to develop Embedded Systems (ESs) despite the lack of empirical evidence on TDD applied to ES development.
Objectives:
Our overarching objective is to start building knowledge on TDD applied to ES development. Specifically, we investigated: (i) the claimed benefits of TDD (i.e., increased external quality of ESs and developers’ productivity) and (ii) how developers apply TDD when developing ESs.
Method:
We conducted two empirical investigations. The former investigation, comprising two experiments, aimed to study the claimed benefits of TDD. To that end, we asked Computer Science (CS) Master’s students to fulfill ES development tasks by using TDD or a non-TDD approach. The latter investigation consisted of an ethnographically-informed study to gain insights into how developers apply TDD when developing ESs. In this study, we involved CS Master’s students, who were observed while fulfilling an ES development task. The participants in the two empirical investigations were different.
Results:
We found that the external quality of the developed ESs increased when using TDD as compared to a non-TDD approach, while there was not a substantial difference in developers’ productivity. However, TDD is perceived as more difficult to apply, and the development task is deemed more challenging with TDD. Several patterns emerged about how developers approach TDD when developing an ES (e.g., the participants did not always develop in conformity with TDD).
Conclusion:
TDD seems to be a promising approach to the development of ESs, even though further research is needed. In this regard, we believe that our results can pave the way for future research with the involvement of software companies and professionals.}

abstract = {Malignant melanoma, a highly lethal subtype of skin cancer, is categorized by the abnormal growth of melanocyte cells and is associated with elevated mortality rates. Improving the prognosis of patients with melanoma requires an early and precise diagnosis. Recently, deep learning models have emerged as dominant tools in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for the categorization of potential melanoma lesions. In clinical settings, obtaining high quality skin images can be challenging due to blurry, noisy, low-contrast images that may contain extraneous objects such as rulers or hair. To overcome these challenges, the Spatio Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Network (STJGCN) was utilized to detect and classify melanoma from dermoscopy images. The input images are collected from the 2020 Challenge Dataset of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The input images are provided to Information Exchange Multi-Bernoulli-Filter (IEMBF) based pre-processing for hair noise removal, resizing, random rotations, cropping, and splitting from input dataset. The pre-processed images are provided to Spatio Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Network (STJGCN) for detecting and classifying melanoma as benign and malignant. The Red Panda Optimization Algorithm (RPOA) is used to fine-tune STJGCN parameters. The proposed EOIQ-MC-STJGCN approach is implemented in Python and various performance metrics are analyzed to assess the efficacy of the proposed approach. The proposed approach attains the highest accuracy of 97.86% in melanoma detection and classification compared to various existing approaches. By demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed EOIQ-MC-STJGCN technique, this research contributes to faster and more accurate melanoma diagnosis, ultimately facilitating earlier intervention and treatment.}

Existing adaptation approaches and research informing them largely focus on outcomes of climactic events, but lack consideration of power structures shaping these phenomena and experiences of them. From a feminist peace perspective, I posit that tackling intersectional violences of climate change necessitates greater engagement with underlying knowledge. This paper explores how ways of knowing climate change impact ways of living with it: analyzing the ground on which climate action interventions stand and the paths on which they set us. I theorize ‘climate transformation’ as processual shifts in ways of knowing a problem and solution toward norms of a feminist peace. Theory is developed abductively, based on original fieldwork in Puerto Rico and drawing on conflict transformation theory and elaborating knowledge production through feminist ethics of care. The model developed here enables analyzing orientations of current situations and change processes in relation to desirable futures. I find that actors involved in peace work and climate action in Puerto Rico foster transformation based on: caring in current relations and experience; caring through change processes affectively and reciprocally; and caring for a vision of the future through prefigurative and historicized imagination. The framework advances academic study and policy development on transformative climate action for tackling historic and intersectional violences to influence and enact particular visions of peace.}

Notably, the influence of market size is apparent, with larger-cap firms predominantly acting as net transmitters, while smaller-cap counterparts serve as net receivers. We also identify asymmetry between quantiles, particularly evident in left tails, underscoring the significance of idiosyncratic shocks. Our findings have important implications for policy makers, investors and regulators.}

This data-oriented curriculum includes foundational technical skills proficiency, data analytical skills, rhetorical skills for arguing with data, interdisciplinary design studies, and a focus on designing for society. It embraces the complexities and opportunities of the data age, and acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in this new landscape.

This study explored the mechanism of saponin biosynthesis and its role in alleviating Cd-induced oxidative damage in the Zhe-Maidong cultivar using three experimental groups undergoing Cd stress. In the Cd-contaminated soil treatment, total saponins were 1.68 times higher than those in the control. The saponin content in the Cd-2 and Cd-3 treatments was approximately twice as high as that in the Cd-CK treatment. These findings revealed that Cd stress leads to total saponin accumulation. Metabolomic analysis identified the accumulated saponins, primarily several monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and triterpenoids. The increased saponins exhibited an antioxidant ability to prevent the accumulation of Cd-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequent saponin application experiments provided strong evidence that saponin played a crucial role in promoting superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reducing ROS accumulation. Transcriptome analysis revealed vital genes for saponin synthesis under Cd stress, including SE, two SSs, and six CYP450s, positively correlated with differentially expressed metabolite (DEM) levels in the saponin metabolic pathway. Additionally, the TF-gene regulatory network demonstrated that bHLH1, bHLH3, mTERF, and AUX/IAA transcript factors are crucial regulators of hub genes involved in saponin synthesis. These findings significantly contribute to our understanding of the regulatory network of saponin synthesis and its role in reducing oxidative damage in O. japonicum when exposed to Cd stress.}

The study employed SPSS and AMOS for descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the complex relationships between generative AI and student outcomes. The findings revealed a significant positive relationship between generative AI and all measured student outcomes. Specifically, 62 % of the variance in cognitive engagement, 66 % in emotional engagement, 46 % in learning retention, 50 % in reward sensitivity, and 72 % in motivation were attributed to the influence of AI-driven learning tools. These results highlight the role of AI in enhancing cognitive processing, fostering emotional connections with learning materials, improving retention through personalized learning, and strengthening reward-based motivation. The study further confirms that students’ engagement with generative AI is a strong predictor of their learning outcomes. Frequent interaction with AI-generated content enhances cognitive comprehension, emotional investment, and adaptive learning behaviors, reinforcing intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.

There are no examples of their adoption for User-Centered Design (UCD). Moreover, such CAD-to-XR workflows do not seize the potentialities of generative algorithms to produce synthetic images (textures). The paper presents a framework for implementing the CAD-to-XR workflow. The solution consists of a module for texture generation based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generated texture is then managed by another module (based on Shrinkwrap modelling) to develop the iPVP by simplifying the 3D model and UV mapping the generated texture. The geometric and material data is integrated into a graphic engine, which allows for programming an interactive experience with the iPVP in XR. The CAD-to-XR framework was validated on two components (rifle stock and forend) of a sporting rifle. The solution can automate the texturing process of different product versions in shorter times (compared to a manual procedure). After each product revision, it avoids tedious and manual activities required to generate a new iPVP. The image quality metrics highlight that images are generated in a “realistic” manner (the perceived quality of generated textures is highly comparable to real images). The quality of the iPVPs, generated through the proposed framework and visualised by users through a mixed reality head-mounted display, is equivalent to traditionally designed prototypes.}

A comprehensive calculation and in-depth analysis of the ecological niche of open innovation ecosystem and basic ecological niche in 30 provincial-level administrative regions (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Tibet) are carried out. The research results not only reveal the significant differences in the suitability of innovation ecological niche among different provincial-level administrative regions, but also show the complex relationship between ecological niche suitability and evolutionary momentum, as well as the different characteristics and development trends of each basic ecological niche. Compared to traditional measurement methods, the large model approach adopted in this study demonstrates significant advantages: (1) It is capable of processing massive and complex datasets, capturing the dynamic changes within innovation ecosystems; (2) By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, it effectively addresses the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNN models, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy; (3) In conjunction with fitness models, it provides a more comprehensive assessment of the internal mechanisms and external environmental factors of innovation ecosystems. This research provides important theoretical basis and empirical support for in-depth understanding of the innovation ecosystem in various provincial-level administrative regions of China, and helps to better grasp the pattern and direction of national innovation development and provide a powerful reference for formulating scientific and reasonable innovation policies.}

abstract = {The optimum usage of fertilizers is key for the sustainable agriculture. Among nutrients, phosphorus (P) is critical for plant growth and development. Due to complete reliance on natural resources (rock phosphate) for P, the availability of P fertilizers is emerging as a global challenge for crop cultivation. Moreover, the excess application of P fertilizers in rice, mostly grown under flooded conditions, leads to water pollution called eutrophication. In this study, we employed a mutagenesis approach for developing and characterizing rice EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) mutants with better adaptation to low soil P conditions. One such mutant of rice cultivar Nagina 22, named NH4824, was characterized comprehensively at seedling and reproductive growth stages under hydroponic and field conditions. The mutant exhibits low soil P tolerance due to combined adaptive changes in root system architecture, anatomy, organic acid exudates, plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase activity, induced expression of P transporter genes, and efficient mobilization and partitioning of P in different plant tissues. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and better photosynthesis suggested relatively less stress experienced by NH4824 than N22 under low soil P conditions. These insights are highly useful to develop P use efficient crop cultivars through breeding or genome editing approaches.}

This study compared the functional response of plant communities on soil-bioengineered riverbanks with those on natural and hard-engineered (ripraps) riverbanks across 124 sites in Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that the Community Weighted Means (CWM) of 10 functional traits and three ecological attributes relevant in a riparian context and based on 356 plant taxa would be similar between bioengineered and natural sites, while functional diversity measured as richness (FRic) and dispersion (FDis) would be higher in bioengineered sites due to the diverse conditions (substrate, microhabitats). Contrary to expectations, we found trait-specific results. Compared to ripraps, natural sites were dominated by plants that were taller and had lighter seeds, as well as higher dispersion in specific leaf area, height, and seed mass, higher FRic, more dispersion of propagules by water and less by animals, and more plants with vegetative reproduction, shade tolerance, wetland-affinity, native, and fewer ruderal species. Bioengineered sites had intermediate mean trait values and dispersion, and only small differences among the three techniques applied (pure, keyed, and mixed) regarding the proportion of living and mineral material. Consistent with a previous study that used the same set of sites, we found higher plant cover, species richness, and diversity in natural sites compared to ripraps, with bioengineered sites falling in between the two. Bioengineering can partially reproduce natural riparian plant communities both taxonomically and functionally. Practitioners should consider functional diversity in their designs.}

One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modeled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.}

abstract = {Objective
This study examined the cross-sectional relationships between neighborhood social composition and gentrification, and acculturation stressors.
Methods
Person-level data came from first-generation Chinese immigrants enrolled in the Immigrant Enclaves Study (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, baseline 2018–2020, N = 512). A validated scale was used to assess 22 stressors associated with migration or acculturation. Neighborhood characteristics from the American Community Survey 2015–2019 and 2008–2012 included: tract proportion of foreign born Chinese, neighborhood wealth, and past decade gentrification. Most neighborhood exposures were modeled as continuous as well as binary variables (intended to represent highest level of neighborhood exposure). Multivariable negative binomial regression adjusted for age, gender, income, education, employment, language, years in the U.S., and neighborhood variables (proportion co-ethnic, and neighborhood per capita income).
Results
The majority of participants spoke Mandarin (68% vs Cantonese 32%), mean participant age was 52.7 years old, years in the US was 18, and nearly one-half of the sample had less than 8 years of education. Mean number of stressors was 5.9 with nearly 20% of participants reporting 11 or more stressors. Multivariable results found the number of acculturation stressors was 18% lower for residents in the highest co-ethnic density neighborhoods and 13% lower for residents in the highest wealth areas, compared to other areas (expβ 0.82, 95% CI [CI] 0.69, 0.98; expβ 0.87, CI 0.75, 1.01, respectively). Stressors were no different whether participants lived in gentrified areas or not.
Conclusions
Among middle-aged Chinese immigrants, acculturation stress was lower for residents in neighborhoods with higher proportion of Chinese immigrants and for residents in neighborhoods with higher wealth, whereas gentrification had no influence on acculturation stress. More work on this topic is needed with vulnerable populations such as this one, informed by local context.}

From addressing administrative tasks to answering dermatology questions, these models are poised to have an impact on dermatology care delivery. As FMs become more ubiquitous in health care, it is important for clinicians and dermatologists to have a basic understanding of how these models are developed, what they are capable of, and what pitfalls exist. In this paper, we present a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the current state of FMs and summarize their current applications in dermatology, highlight their limitations, and discuss future developments in the field.}

In addition, using integrated multi-channel eye-tracking, Education Data Mining techniques, and data fusion provides information about how each student deploys these strategies at the process level (rather than the results level) and at a level of detail that other techniques do not. The general objectives of this study were: (1) Determine whether students’ behaviours in the LMS predicted results of their learning in different evaluation tests (individual vs. group); (2) Determine whether behavioural records (physiological and eye-tracking) produced with integrated multi-channel techniques predicted learning results in different evaluation tests (individual vs. group); (3) Test whether student behaviours in resources and activities in ALT environments differed depending on the degree type; and (4) Determine whether the results of monitoring student behaviours in ALT environments via integrated multi-channel technology using heat maps and gaze point differed depending on the students’ learning results. The study was performed during one semester with a sample of 64 university students in their final year of health sciences or biomedical engineering degrees. Their learning behaviour in terms of activities and resources in Moodle was monitored along with their use of self-regulated virtual labs for promoting thinking skills. Learning results were assessed using traditional multiple-choice tests and project-based learning assessments (execution and presentation). The results indicate that the variance in the results explained by the use of activities and resources aimed at acquiring thinking skills was greater in project-based learning assessments in both course groups. In addition, the variance explained by the indicators of cognitive load measured by eye-tracking and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) was greater for the learning results in traditional testing. The use of ALT resources and self-regulated virtual laboratories enhanced students’ acquisition of thinking skills. Nonetheless, learning activities must be carefully designed and learning behaviours need to be monitored during the learning process in order to tailor the educational response. This requires better teacher—and student—training in using these resources and in interpreting the resulting records.}

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition affecting the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa, often accompanied by olfactory dysfunction. Eosinophilic CRS with nasal polyps (ECRSwNP) is a subtype of CRS characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. Animal models for ECRSwNP with olfactory dysfunction are necessary for exploring potential therapeutic strategies.
Objective
The aim of this study was to establish a mouse model of ECRSwNP combined with olfactory dysfunction in a shorter time frame using intranasal ovalbumin and Aspergillus protease (AP) administration. The efficacy of the model was validated by evaluating sinonasal inflammation, cytokine levels, olfactory function, and neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb.
Methods
Male BALB/c mice were intranasally administered ovalbumin and AP for 6 and 12 weeks to induce ECRSwNP. The resultant ECRSwNP mouse model underwent histologic assessment, cytokine analysis of nasal lavage fluid, olfactory behavioral tests, and gene expression profiling to identify neuroinflammatory markers within the olfactory bulb.
Results
The developed mouse model exhibited substantial eosinophil infiltration, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in nasal lavage fluid, and confirmed olfactory dysfunction through behavioral assays. Furthermore, olfactory bulb inflammation and reduced mature olfactory sensory neurons were observed in the model.
Conclusion
This study successfully established a validated mouse model of ECRSwNP with olfactory dysfunction within a remarkably short span of 6 weeks, providing a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis and potential therapies for this condition. The model offers an efficient approach for future research in CRS with nasal polyps and olfactory dysfunction.}

Despite its significant potential, research on GenAI's role in enhancing creativity and innovation is still in its early stages. The present work advances this emerging field by focusing on the human-GenAI dyad. Specifically, we propose a formal model of hybrid creative process designed to maximize the synergistic potential of the human-GenAI interaction. Drawing on machine learning literature, we conceptualize GenAI as a superposition of latent entities. Through formal argumentation, we demonstrate that optimal creative outcomes arise when human agents actively select the most appropriate entity from the complete spectrum of potential alternatives for the problem at hand. Finally, we outline the ideal iterative process required to asymptotically converge toward these optimal entities. Beyond its practical utility for managers, our model provides new insights into human-GenAI mutual augmentation, the nature of creativity, and the skills and cognitive properties involved.}

However, overbrowsing threatens this ecosystem, underscoring the need for sustainable management strategies. This study assessed the impact of three browsing intensities on argan trees in the Essaouira region: no-browsing, moderate-browsing (managed browsing or the Agdal system), and heavy-browsing systems. Measurements of argan physiological and biochemical traits and soil parameters revealed significant differences among the three-browsing intensities. Heavily browsed argan trees exhibited reduced photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic pigments content, and leaf area index, while no-browsing system maintained optimal performances. The Agdal strategy significantly enhanced plant health compared to heavy browsing, improving physiological indicators and soil quality. Soil traits including electrical conductivity, moisture, and organic matter and total nitrogen content were notably better under managed browsing, promoting healthier argan ecosystems. Additionally, browsing intensity affected leaf biochemistry: overbrowsing induced a decline in protein content, while it enhanced total soluble sugars, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide content, and antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase), reflecting heightened stress responses. Overall, even if the non-browsed trees performed best, the moderate-browsing system (Agdal) may be the most suitable of the three browsing systems, since it will be able to meet goats’ feed needs while ensuring the sustainability of the argan forest ecosystem.}

Positive genetic correlations were observed among meat color traits.

The approach involves two steps. The first is design constraints pre-processing, which comprises (a) initial user input, and (b) pre-processing for initial setup. The second is building plan generation, involving (a) perception, (b) planning, and (c) action modules. Multiple illustrative examples are explored to verify the proposed generative design algorithm in terms of robustness, efficiency, and scale. We discover that the algorithm can handle complex combinations of input constraints (e.g., number of rooms, room areas, adjacency connections, and building boundaries) and generate plausible floorplans in a robust, efficient way that can be scaled up to bigger, more complex floorplan generative design problems. With proper adaptation, the algorithm can potentially be applied to other building types, such as office or hospital buildings.}

The use of synthetic data is a widely discussed and promising solution for privacy-preserving medical research. Synthetic data may, however, not always rule out the risk of re-identifying characteristics of real patients and can vary greatly in terms of data fidelity and utility. We systematically evaluate the trade-offs between privacy, fidelity, and utility across five synthetic data models and three patient-level datasets. We evaluate fidelity based on statistical similarity to the real data, utility on three machine learning use cases, and privacy via membership inference, singling out, and attribute inference risks. Synthetic data without differential privacy (DP) maintained fidelity and utility without evident privacy breaches, whereas DP-enforced models significantly disrupted correlation structures. K-anonymity-based data sanitization of demographic features, while preserving fidelity, introduced notable privacy risks. Our findings emphasize the need to advance methods that effectively balance privacy, fidelity, and utility in synthetic patient data generation.}

By utilizing bridge parameters and seismic data, this method eliminates the need for time-consuming on-site inspections, enabling quick and accurate predictions of bridge safety and traffic capacity. SMOTE is used to generate synthetic samples for all categories, with sampling ratios carefully adjusted to determine the optimal configuration that maximizes accuracy and improves data balance. The enhanced XGBoost model is then trained on the balanced dataset to classify bridge conditions, effectively mitigating the impact of class imbalance. The study also compares the performance of XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost on both original and SMOTE-balanced datasets. Results indicate that the SMOTE-enhanced XGBoost model achieves a best accuracy of 83.3 %–87.5 %. This study integrates oversampling techniques with machine learning and proposes an automated modeling framework for imbalanced data. Its key innovation lies in the automatic determination of the optimal oversampling ratio, which is incorporated into the XGBoost training process to significantly improve classification performance and generalization ability, providing reliable support for emergency response and functional recovery.}

abstract = {Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted prediction of hospital admission is an innovative tool that optimizes resource allocation and improves patient flow within emergency departments. Health institutions need to decongest these departments to maintain sustainability and become efficient. Increasing demand and excessive competition for limited resources directly contribute to these challenges.
Objective
This systematic review aims to evaluate the use of artificial intelligence in the prediction of hospital admissions, evaluating the accuracy of machine learning models, their impact on clinical decision- making, and their role in the optimization and allocation of resources.
Methods
A systematic review of studies published between 2019 and 2024 followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were selected based on a pre-defined Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework, and methodological quality was assessed using the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (ChAMAI) tools.
Results
A total of 20 studies were included; most of the studies evaluated were retrospective. AI-based models demonstrated superior accuracy (85 % to 95 %) compared to traditional methods, with Random Forest (RF) and Neural Networks outperforming classical statistical models. Studies incorporating unstructured data through Natural Language Processing (NLP) have significantly improved patient flow and resource allocation. The integration of predictive analytics resulted in a reduction in avoidable hospitalizations, optimized bed occupancy, and a decrease in emergency room overcrowding.
Conclusion
AI-driven admission prediction is promising in the hospital setting, as it improves efficiency and allows for proactive and rapid decision-making, optimizing available resources. Future research is promising and should focus on prospective studies to validate practical applicability.}

Existing research suggests that ligands for the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels may carry a risk of abuse. To evaluate the abuse potential of crisugabalin, five well-recognized animal models were utilized in these preclinical studies. Firstly, an intravenous self-administration paradigm was implemented in rats that were self-administering propofol to assess the reinforcing effects of crisugabalin. Secondly, a rat drug discrimination study was employed to determine the pharmacological similarity between crisugabalin and the training drug midazolam. Then, a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in rats was utilized to evaluate the rewarding properties of crisugabalin. After that, a spontaneous withdrawal study was conducted in rats chronically treated with crisugabalin to examine the liability of developing physical dependence. Finally, a mouse pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model was used following chronic exposure to crisugabalin to assess its potential for physical dependence. The results indicated that crisugabalin showed no positive reinforcing effects and did not display midazolam-like discriminative stimulus effects. Moreover, crisugabalin did not induce significant CPP in rats and there was no risk of physical dependence in the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model. In the rat spontaneous withdrawal study, crisugabalin demonstrated a very low level of physical dependence. These findings suggest that crisugabalin has minimal to no potential for abuse, thereby establishing itself as a safer option relative to pregabalin and mirogabalin.}

TouTiao (recommended news application with the largest number of registered users in China) was chosen as the research object and a total of 1014 valid questionnaires were collected. The results based on mediation and moderation tests show that algorithm appreciation plays a mediating role among the perceived news value, the perceived recommendation personalization, the perceived recommendation explainability and the continuance usage intention. Algorithm fatigue plays a mediating role among users' perceived information narrowing, perceived content low quality, perceived information overload and continuance usage intention. Privacy concerns negatively moderate the positive effect of algorithm appreciation on continuance usage intention, while positively moderating the negative effect of algorithm fatigue on continuance usage intention. To enhance users' continuance usage intention recommended news apps, it is necessary to pay attention to the two emotional elements of algorithm appreciation and algorithm fatigue, thereby improving user experience, and achieving a win-win situation between the platform and users.}

However, our understanding of the effect of lipid nanostructure on interactions of NCs with bacteria is lacking. Herein, we investigate the interactions of four different lipid NCs (including both cubosomes and hexosomes) with a simple bacterial supported lipid bilayer (SLB) mimicking the lipid bilayer of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a combination of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF-M), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Addition of the fusogenic lipid di-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) increased interactions with the SLB, while addition of the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) significantly increased interactions. The QCM-D data and SR-SAXS data indicate that mixing of the particles with E. coli mimicking model layers results in significant disruption to the cubosome structure, while hexosomes remain essentially structurally intact. We propose that the interaction mechanism with bacterial membranes differs among lipid NCs; while cubosomes primarily fuse with the lipid bilayer resulting in a loss of internal nanostructure, hexosomes interact with bacterial membranes via a different mechanism which allows them to retain structural integrity.}

Unfortunately, in the United States, a concerning 63% of fourth-grade children are reading below grade level, with approximately 7%–10% exhibiting a disability in word reading, developmental dyslexia. Research in developmental cognitive neuroscience indicates that individuals with dyslexia show functional and structural brain alterations in regions processing reading and reading-related information, with some of these differences emerging as early as preschool and even infancy. This suggests that some children start schooling with less optimal brain architecture for learning to read, emphasizing the need for preventative education practices. This article reviews educational policies impacting children with dyslexia and highlights a decentralized parent-led grassroots movement, Decoding Dyslexia, which centers the voices of those directly impacted by dyslexia. It utilizes civic engagement practices, advocacy and lobbying on local, federal, and social media platforms, and strong partnerships with scientists to drive systems-level change in educational practices, leading to dyslexia prevention legislation across the U.S. The ongoing partnership continues to address the profound gaps between scientific findings and policymaking to drive systems-level change for contemporary challenges in educational practices within a learning disabilities framework.}

Some suggest generative AI could offer decision-makers perspectives they had previously not considered, leading to more equitable and innovative policy approaches, and supporting several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We critique this perspective. Groups may be underrepresented in sustainable development decision-making because of individual cognitive and organisational information-processing limitations (‘omitted, but not opposed’), and because of opposition which remains even if these limitations are overcome (‘opposed, whether omitted or not’). We outline how these ‘categories of omission’ shape the opportunities and risks created by generative AI in representative sustainability.}

This study proposes probability models that convert the natural snowpack stability index estimated by the physical-based snowpack model into the probability of the number of dry-snow avalanches per day. For this purpose, three types of probability models formulated by Poisson, Negative Binomial, and Zero-Inflated Poisson distributions were developed, assuming that the avalanche occurrences follow a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. In these models, the expected number of avalanches per day increases exponentially with larger unstable snowpack areas where the stability index is below a threshold. Bayesian inference has optimized the models to fit the historical avalanches from the winter of 1958/1959 to the winter of 2011/2012 in December, January, and February in north Japan and Niigata regions. The optimized models largely replicated the probability density function of the number of historical avalanches and their exponential increase with increasing unstable snowpack areas. The posterior predictive checks and the widely applicable information criteria both indicated that the model formulated by Negative Binomial distribution best reproduced the number of historical avalanches. However, the models underestimated the number of avalanches in recent decades due to the nonhomogeneity in the statistical sensitivity of avalanche occurrences to the snowpack instability. We also demonstrated some practical applications of the models, such as predicting avalanche occurrences and reproducing the annual number of avalanches.}

As a result of the descriptive analysis, five main themes were identified: critical content production and evaluation, metacognitive skills and self-regulation, ethical thinking and evaluation, analytical thinking and problem solving, motivation and self-efficacy for the AI-assisted writing process and critical literacy skills. Our findings show that students use AI tools not as a simple copy-paste tool, but as a supportive element to develop their thinking. Students question AI outputs, synthesize them with their own ideas and manage their writing processes more consciously. The findings of our study reveal that AI-assisted writing experiences increase students' ethical awareness of originality, academic honesty and creativity, improve their systematic thinking skills in complex writing tasks, and increase their motivation to write. However, the lack of any study at preschool level, the limited number of studies at primary school level, and the scarcity of qualitative studies indicate that more research is needed in this field.}

The experiment is designed to explore how AI advisors influence the depth of human reasoning by shaping beliefs, learning, and sophisticated backward induction. Extended cognitive hierarchy models (Camerer et al., 2004) are applied to identify heterogeneous level distribution and more sophisticated thinking. Additionally, the interactions between participants with and without AI advisors are examined. Two key results emerge. First, individuals overestimate AI capabilities when competing against AI-guided participants, which motivates them to employ higher levels of thinking. This observed higher-level behaviour is driven by more sophisticated backward reasoning. Second, improved reasoning under AI guidance shows heterogeneous effects across Cognitive Reflection Test scores, suggesting that AI's impact depends on participants' pre-existing cognitive abilities. Overall, this early research provides insights into the interaction between generative AI and human cognition and reasoning.}

abstract = {Bioretention systems for managing urban runoff rely on healthy plants to reduce runoff and nutrient pollution via evapotranspiration and uptake. However, loss of plant cover is common and, in cold climates, potentially caused by the application of road salt. To investigate the impact of road salt on bioretention systems, we measured salt concentrations in the media and plant tissues and assessed plant cover at 19 sites in Toronto, Canada, in the field. Winter road salt was identified as the primary driver of plant cover loss: low-tolerance species accumulated excessive sodium and chloride, resulting in chlorotic and necrotic damage even under moderate salinity (median electrical conductivity (EC), 0.31–0.35 mS/cm, as measured in soil–water suspensions). Continuous EC monitoring showed no net salt buildup in any season, although salinity peaked in winter and was lower in summer. Low-tolerance species exhibited high salt ion uptake and substantial damage from legacy salt retained in the media. Although species-specific ion accumulation patterns were observed, they did not always align with species salt tolerance as described in the literature. Among the 14 species studied, Hemerocallis ‘Happy Returns’ (low tolerance) and Panicum virgatum (medium tolerance) significantly accumulated sodium, up to 2126 and 586 mg/kg, respectively, whereas Salvia officinalis (medium tolerance) significantly accumulated chloride (up to 20 mg/g); yet only Panicum virgatum displayed minimal damage (<5 %), while Hemerocallis ‘Happy Returns’ and Salvia officinalis displayed >50 % damage. These findings underscore the importance of selecting salt-tolerant species to ensure long-term bioretention performance.}

Generative AI (Gen AI) has the potential to mitigate these limitations by enhancing efficiency and standardization, yet its deployment also introduces risks such as algorithmic bias and loss of transparency. This calls for a systematic framework to support strategic decision-making and guide responsible adoption. This study introduces the Maturity–Expectation Gap (MEG) framework, which captures the misalignment between stakeholder perceptions of AI maturity and the actual technological state. Existing models such as the Technology Acceptance Model fail to reflect the temporal and institutional dynamics of emerging technologies. To address this, the study combines expert survey data on perceived maturity with machine learning-based literature analysis to compute expectation scores across twenty-four evaluation criteria. Results show that MEG significantly varies across stakeholder groups, and that higher MEG values are associated with lower confidence in Gen AI adoption, highlighting the framework's utility in explaining strategic adoption decisions (RQ1). Furthermore, MEG enables diagnostic classification of evaluation domains, identifying areas of alignment (e.g., Financial Health) and misalignment (e.g., Decision-Making), thereby supporting phased and risk-aware deployment strategies (RQ2). MEG framework offers a structured lens for managing expectation–capability alignment, extending technology adoption theory while supporting strategic decision-making for the responsible integration of Gen AI in public-sector evaluation systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a vital modality for investigating brain related disorders. However, data scarcity especially for novel molecular targets like neuroepigenetic enzymes combined with difficult-to-recruit patient populations limits the development of machine learning (ML) models. Our primary objective is to enhance single-subject classification of neuromolecular imaging data and facilitate biomarker discovery. We demonstrate our approach using histone deacetylase (HDAC) PET/MR imaging in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).
Methods
We propose Catalysis Training pipeline, a framework that augments real imaging data with high-quality synthetic data generated by a Wasserstein Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (WCGAN). Using [11C]Martinostat PET/MR imaging, we extracted 1-D standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) tabular features representing HDAC enzyme expression density across eight cingulate subregions. These were used to train and test ML classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Random Forest, under leave-one-out cross-validation.
Results
Integrating synthetic data in the training process improved classification accuracy significantly: +26% for XGBoost and Random Forest (from 59% to 85%), and +18% for SVM (from 70% to 88%). Synthetic samples improved model generalizability. Key hemispheric and subregional cingulate HDAC patterns were also identified as potential biomarkers.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that generative AI can help overcome data scarcity in low-data regime neuroimaging applications. Catalysis Training provides a scalable strategy to enhance ML-driven biomarker discovery and disease classification, especially for rare or difficult-to-study disorders like AUD. Clinically, cingulate HDAC expression measured by [11C]Martinostat PET/MR shows promise as an objective biomarker for AUD, complementing DSM-based diagnosis and informing novel treatment strategies.}

abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and treatment recommendation performance of four artificial intelligence chatbots in fictional pulpal and periradicular disease cases. Additionally, it investigated response consistency and the influence of text order and language on chatbot performance.
Methods
In this cross-sectional comparative study, eleven cases representing various pulpal and periradicular pathologies were created. These cases were presented to four chatbots (ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, Bard, and Bing) in both Portuguese and English, with the information order varied (signs and symptoms first or imaging data first). Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test, Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner pairwise comparisons, simple logistic regression, and the binomial test.
Results
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy rates (86.4 % and 85.3 % respectively), significantly outperforming ChatGPT 3.5 (46.5 %) and Bard (28.6 %) (p < 0.001). For treatment recommendations, ChatGPT 4.0, Bing, and ChatGPT 3.5 performed similarly (94.4 %, 93.2 %, and 86.3 %, respectively), while Bard exhibited significantly lower accuracy (75 %, p < 0.001). No significant association between diagnosis and treatment accuracy was found for Bard and Bing, but a positive association was observed for ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0 (p < 0.05). The overall consistency rate was 98.29 %, with no significant differences related to text order or language. Cases presented in Portuguese prompted significantly more additional information requests than those in English (33.5 % vs. 10.2 %; p < 0.001), with the relevance of this information being higher in Portuguese (29.5 % vs. 8.5 %; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Bing and ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, while Bard showed the lowest accuracy in both diagnosis and treatment recommendations. However, the clinical application of these tools necessitates critical interpretation by dentists, as chatbot responses are not consistently reliable.}

abstract = {Background
Despite research linking chemical and physical restraints to negative outcomes including unplanned intubations and psychological distress, there is little guidance for their use in the care of trauma patients. We used institutional data to describe recent trends in chemical and physical restraint in the emergency department evaluation and treatment of trauma patients and to identify characteristics associated with their use.
Methods
This study includes adult trauma activations at a United States urban level I trauma center from January 2016 to July 2022. Data were collected from the trauma registry and medical record. We assessed the use of chemical restraints and physical restraints during care provided in the trauma resuscitation bay and emergency department. We assessed trends over time graphically and with logistic regression. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations between restraint use and patient and clinical characteristics and the outcomes of ICU admission, hospitalization duration, and mortality.
Results
Of the 8,112 patients, most were male (74.8 %), White (55.8 %), and privately insured (35.2 %). Overall, 8.1 % were restrained with 7.1 % chemically restrained and 2.7 % physically restrained. Overall restraint use increased 254 % (p < 0.001) from 2016 to 2022 driven primarily by a 460 % (p < 0.001) increase in chemical restraint use including a 630 % increase in ketamine administrations (p < 0.001). Use of restraints was associated with pre-existing psychotic disorders, intoxication, altered mental status, increasing injury severity, and Medicaid insurance (p < 0.001). Chemical restraint administration was associated with a 3.5 percentage point (95 %CI 1.1–5.9; p = 0.004) increase in the probability of ICU admission and a 1.0 day (95 %CI 0.6–1.4; p < 0.001) increase in hospitalization duration.
Conclusions
In this institutional study, nearly one-in-twelve trauma patients were restrained during emergency department evaluation and treatment. Restraint utilization increased during the study driven primarily by increases in ketamine and restraints utilized during trauma bay evaluation and resuscitation. Future research should assess the generalizability of these findings. It is important that rigorous guidelines are established to ensure the safe and effective use of restraints in trauma.}

This shift has impacted English Language Teaching (ELT), leading to the rise of Global Englishes Language Teaching (GELT), which advocates a more inclusive and accurate approach to ELT. However, implementing GELT faces significant barriers, particularly the lack of learning materials, which stifles innovation. Digital technologies, especially recent advancements. In Generative AI (GenAI), offer new avenues for overcoming these challenges. Adopting a critical ecological perspective, this study explores the potential and limitations of GenAI in developing and implementing GE-oriented materials from teachers’ perspectives at a secondary school in China. Data collected through reflective journals, classroom observations, roundtable discussions, and video-stimulated recall interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Findings suggest that AI enhances efficiency in material development, supports student-centred design, integrates well with digital resources, and boosts student engagement. However, challenges include rigid curricular structures, AI inaccuracies, technical issues, and AI’s inability to replace teachers’ unique insights. This study argues that AI offers promising support for GE-oriented materials development, with teachers’ unique role remains indispensable in GELT. Methodological, pedagogical, and empirical implications are discussed.}

However, there is a scarcity of understanding of nighttime safety despite the fast-growing body of urban scene auditing research based on daytime street view imagery (SVI). To fill the gap, this study collected ∼1000 pairwise day-and-night SVIs to train a day-to-night (D2N) SVI generator to effectively predict nighttime SVI based on daytime counterpart using generative adversarial network (GAN). The accuracy of fake nighttime image was evaluated with commonly-used GAN metrics (e.g., structural similarity index, inception score) and human validation. Then, an online visual survey with 46 participants was conducted to collect their perceived safety on street scenes during daytime and nighttime (D&N), and the results become training labels for machine learning models to predict D&N safety perceptions. Our results revealed significant discrepancies in D&N safety perception. First, through correlation analysis, we found that the sky and building features matter to the prediction accuracy of generated nighttime SVIs. Second, the micro-level streetscape features (e.g., pavements, roads, and buildings) play influential roles in perceived safety. Third, higher safety perceptions are consistently found in areas with higher building density regardless of whether they are daytime or night. In contrast, untended trees and grass reduce perceived safety at night. This study provides a valuable reference for improving the accuracy of generating nighttime images from daytime SVIs. It also reveals how streetscapes affect D&N safety perceptions in high-density cities like Hong Kong, providing empirical evidence for urban design policies to facilitate nighttime attractiveness and prosperity.}

Additionally, recent studies have indicated variations in the serum levels of adipokines in pigs with higher fat content, suggest their common interaction. It was therefore hypothesized that ITLN1 regulates the levels of other adipokines and their receptors in the ovary of pigs with different fat content. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro effect of ITLN1 (10–100 ng/mL) on the levels of other adipokines, namely adiponectin, apelin, leptin, chemerin, resistin, visfatin, and vaspin in the culture medium, assessed by ELISA. In addition, the effect of ITLN1 on the mRNA expression of the above-mentioned adipokines with their receptors was investigated using RT-qPCR in granulosa cells (Gc) from normal weight Large White (LW) and fat Meishan (MS) pigs on days 10–12 of the estrous cycle. The results showed that ITLN1 reduced apelin levels, increased leptin, and had no effect on vaspin in the culture medium. ITLN1 was found to have a modulating effect on the mRNA expression of the other adipokines with their receptors in porcine Gc. It can, therefore, be proposed that ITLN1 represents a previously unidentified auto- and paracrine regulator of the functions of ovarian microenvironmental compartments in different types of pig breeds.}

Rare diseases (RDs) are conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 people, with over 7,000 identified, primarily genetic in nature, and more than half impacting children. Although each RD affects a small population, collectively, between 3.5% and 5.9% of the global population, or 262.9–446.2 million people, live with an RD. Most RDs lack established treatment protocols, highlighting the need for proper care pathways addressing prognosis, diagnosis, and management. Advances in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to document the temporal progression of phenotypic features, addressing gaps in current knowledge bases. This study proposes an LLM-based framework to capture the natural history of diseases, specifically focusing on Noonan syndrome.

Intrathecal 2,5-dihydro-7-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3H-pyrazolo [4,3-c] quinoline-3-one (PZ-II-029, positive allosteric modulator of α6GABAA receptors) reduced tactile allodynia in female but not in male rats with neuropathic pain. PZ-II-029 was also more effective in females than males in inflammatory and nociplastic pain. Ovariectomy abated the antiallodynic effect of PZ-II-029 in neuropathic rats, whereas 17β-estradiol or 4,4′,4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT), estradiol receptor-α agonist, restored the effect of PZ-II-029 in ovariectomized rats. Blockade of estradiol receptor-α, using MPP (1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy) phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride), prevented the effect of 17β-estradiol on PZ-II-029-induced antiallodynia in ovariectomized neuropathic females. Nerve injury reduced α6GABAA receptor protein expression at the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord of intact and ovariectomized female rats. In this last group, reconstitution with 17β-estradiol fully restored its expression in DRG and spinal cord. In male rats, nerve injury reduced α6GABAA receptor protein expression only at the spinal cord. Nerve injury enhanced estradiol receptor-α protein expression at the DRG in intact non-ovariectomized rats. However, ovariectomy decreased estradiol receptor-α protein expression at the DRG. In the spinal cord there were no changes in estradiol receptor-α protein expression. 17β-estradiol restored estradiol receptor-α protein expression at the DRG and increased it at the spinal cord of neuropathic rats. These data suggest that 17β-estradiol modulates the expression and function of the α6GABAA receptor through its interaction with estradiol receptor-α in female rats.}

abstract = {Asphalt pavement experiences various wet-dry histories in the service stage. However, the influence of wet-dry history on asphalt mixture is unknown. Therefore, to clarify the performance degradation mechanism and predict the performance of asphalt mixture under the action of wet-dry history, the creep-recovery test, indirect tensile stiffness modulus test and indirect tensile strength test were conducted at different temperatures. The finite element method was adopted to analyze the moisture diffusing profile inside the specimen after wet-dry cycles. A moisture damage model considering the soaking time and repeated characteristics was developed to predict the damaged properties. Results show that wet-dry cycles cause a slight mass loss of asphalt mixture. Wet-dry cycling action leads to the increment in high-temperature deformation, and reductions in stiffness modulus and tensile strength. The increase of high-temperature deformation is primarily caused by viscoplastic component. Even if the soaking time is short, high moisture damage occurs while the wet-dry cycle is sufficient. Numerical simulations show that the moisture concentration profiles inside asphalt mixture vary under different wet-dry histories, leading to variations in the damage zone. The degree of damage is also closely related to the acting time of moisture. The critical immersion time of the dense asphalt mixture (about 43 hours) was determined in this study. When the immersion period is shorter than the critical immersion time, the strength loss is greater than the modulus. On the contrary, the degree of modulus damage is higher than that of strength. Considering the actual rainfall climate in China, the strength damage of the on-site asphalt mixture in the field predominates. The proposed model could reflect the weakening trends of modulus and strength. It has good universal applicability in predicting the damaged Marshall stability, modulus, and strength at different temperatures.}

In light of quantitative discussions, it is presented that AII exerts negative influences on GSCPI and GEUI, highlighting that the development of artificial intelligence would facilitate global supply chain stability and energy sustainability; in turn, GSCPI and GEUI have positive and adverse influences on AII. Through comparing, the correlation between AII and GEUI is only reflected in the short term, whereas the interrelationship between AII and GSCPI could be observed in the short-, medium- and long-run situations. In addition, GSCPI exerts positive and negative influences on GEUI in the short, medium and long runs, whereas the positive effects of GEUI on GSCPI means the uncertainty in the energy market might destroy the supply chain across the globe.

The innovation capability largely determines the initiative for future development of a region. Higher school is the main position for training innovative talents. Accurate and comprehensive assessment of innovation cultivation capability is an important basis of higher schools for continuous improvement. Thus, this paper focuses on assessing innovative talent cultivation capability. First, by CIPP model (Context, Input, Process and Product Evaluation), an assessment indicator system is built, consisting of 89 indicators in 21 categories. Then, based on indicator characteristics, this paper uses public data statistics, database retrieving, student survey, teacher survey, support personnel and expert investigation, to collect indicator values. After this, by a powerful machine learning algorithm, gradient Boosting regression tree, a capability assessment model is established. And based on collected data, established model is compared with several regression models in innovative talent cultivation capability assessing. Results confirm the performance superiority of our solution.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to provide a transcript of a dialogue among literacy educators and researchers on the impact of generative aritficial intelligence (AI) in the field. In the spring of 2023, a lively conversation emerged on the National Council of Research on Language and Literacy (NCRLL)’s listserv. Stephanie initiated the conversation by sharing an op-ed she wrote for Atlanta Journal-Constitution about the rise of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, moving beyond the general public’s concerns about student cheating and robot takeovers. NCRLL then convened a webinar of eight leading scholars in writing and literacies development, inspired by that listerv conversation and an organizational interest in promoting intergenerational collaboration among literacy scholars.
Design/methodology/approach
As former doctoral students of two of the panel participants, webinar facilitators Grace and Victoria positioned themselves primarily as learners about this topic and gathered questions from colleagues, P-16 practitioners and those outside the field of education to assess the concerns and wonderings that ChatGPT and generative AI have raised. The following webinar conversation was recorded on two different days due to scheduling conflicts. It has been merged and edited into one dialogue for coherence and convergence.
Findings
Panel participants raise a host of questions and issues that go beyond topics of ethics, morality and basic writing instruction. Furthermore, in dialogue with one another, they describe possibilities for meaningful pedagogy and critical literacy to ensure that generative AI is used for a socially just future for students. While the discussion addressed matters of pedagogy, definitions of literacy and the purpose of (literacy) education, other themes included a critique of capitalism; an interrogation of the systems of power and oppression involved in using generative AI; and the philosophical, ontological, ethical and practical life questions about being human.
Originality/value
This paper provides a glimpse into one of the first panel conversations about ChatGPT and generative AI in the field of literacy. Not only are the panel members respected scholars in the field, they are also former doctoral students and advisors of one another, thus positioning all involved as both learners and teachers of this new technology.}

Drawing upon the attitudinal ambivalence perspective (i.e., the simultaneous occurrence of positive and negative evaluations of genAI use) and cognitive appraisal theory of emotion, our study proposes and tests an integrative research model to understand how users' attitudinal ambivalence towards genAI technology navigates their negative and positive emotional responses and shapes their post-adoption behaviors. We surveyed 530 genAI users and employed the structural equation modeling approach to test our research model. We find that attitudinal ambivalence is significantly associated with users' extended use and avoidance through the mediation of user trust and fear. Additionally, transparency significantly moderates the effects of attitudinal ambivalence on user trust and fear. Our study advances nature and consequences of attitudinal ambivalence towards genAI and provides insights for practitioners contemplating deploying genAI.}

However, the discrepancy between designer inputs and model-preferred prompts makes it challenging for designers to consistently deliver effective results to end users. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel hybrid method that assists designers in crafting user-centric prompts for T2I models, ensuring that the generated UIs align with end-user expectations. First, this method merges text mining and Kansei Engineering (KE) to analyze online user reviews and construct a Knowledge Graph (KG), mapping the intricate relationships between diverse affective requirements of users, design features, and corresponding text prompts for UI generation. Then, our approach automatically transforms designer inputs into model-preferred prompts through entity mention recognition and entity linking during the human-AI collaborative design process. Finally, we validate the proposed approach with a case study on automotive human–machine interface design. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high performance in perceived efficiency, satisfaction, and expectation disconfirmation. Overall, this study represents a step forward in integrating human and AI contributions in design and innovation within engineering disciplines, enabling AI to inspire, develop, and reinforce human creativity from a human factors perspective.}

Utilizing varied prompt engineering techniques, the study evaluates the efficacy of GPT-based services from OpenAI in interpreting the nuanced semantic network structures of BPMN-as-RDF and the standard control flow hierarchical decomposition of BPMN-as-XML. Although image-based multi-modal interpretation of BPMN diagrams is also available in such services, our work is motivated by the fact that most BPM systems deliver structured serializations and not images through their APIs; moreover, any data stored in diagrams cannot be scrutinized by computer vision capabilities, being set as annotations in most tools. By exploring both the challenges and effectiveness of utilizing natural language in interacting with BPMN models, the analysis underscores the ability of RDF to mediate semantic richness and open-ended extension of procedural knowledge compared to the closed-world of the XML interchange schemas. Diagrammatic environments are thus encouraged to pursue this as a potential convergence between different means of knowledge representation.}

The converter configuration comprises two full-bridge diode rectifiers, positioned at both input and output sides, complemented by a full-bridge isolated resonant DC–DC converter. By providing soft-switching across all semiconductor components, the proposed design could achieve a significant power density increase while still preserving the power conversion efficiency in an acceptable range. The novel control algorithm concurrently governs power factor and output voltage, employing the duty cycle as the primary control variable and the phase shift as an auxiliary parameter. Using this synergistic method fulfills more efficiency, increases power density, and improves power factor performance. The effectiveness and reliability of the converter were carefully confirmed by experiments done on a prototype, which provided the capacity to provide over 400 watts in its maximum state of operation. Notably, the converter's adaptability makes it an ideal candidate for a wide variety of applications, with a specific emphasis on integrating renewable energy sources into power systems.}

The findings reveal that this relationship is statistically significant at both high and low values of the transition variable. In this study, government investment in education is treated as a transition variable and an alternative to educational expenditures. The results indicate a threshold of 7.44 % and a slope of 1.3. In the first regime, both the exchange rate and workforce negatively affect industrial value added. Conversely, in the second regime, the exchange rate and workforce have a positive impact on added value. Notably, physical capital exerts a linear and constant effect on added value in both regimes, while educational expenditures significantly enhance added value only in the second regime.}

This model goes beyond cognitive domains and comprises three major components. The components are: learning outcomes include self-system, metacognitive system, and cognitive system; instructional design includes student career development, student skill development, and knowledge and concept learning; and effective video design includes content design, theory-driven design for human-computer interaction, and the use of generative AI. This model guides researchers and practitioners to research and teach business courses using VBL. We also suggested six future research directions, including investigating the relationships between instructional design and learning outcome and the applications of AI in VBL.}

ARGs were annotated with CARD-RGI and MEGARes databases, and bacterial diversity was characterised by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SM-Seq, with species annotation in SILVA/GreenGenes databases or Kraken2 and the NCBI nucleotide database respectively. CARD and MEGARes identified evenly distributed ARG profiles but MEGARes detected a richer array of ARGs (richness = 475 vs 320). Qualitatively, ARGs encoding for aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and multidrug resistance were the most abundant in all examined databases. RNA-seq detected only 32 % of ARGs identified by SM-Seq, but there was concordance in the qualitative identification of aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide, phenicol, sulfonamide and multidrug resistance by SM-Seq and RNA-seq. qPCR confirmed the detection of some ARGs, including OXA, VEB and EREB, that were identified by SM-Seq and RNA-seq in the influent. For bacteria, SM-Seq or 16S rRNA gene sequencing were equally effective in population profiling at phyla or class level. However, SM-Seq identified a significantly higher species richness (richness = 15,000 vs 3750). These results demonstrate that SM-Seq with gene annotation in CARD and MEGARes are equally sufficient for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in wastewater. For more precise ARG identification and quantification however, MEGARes presented a better resolution. The functionality of detected ARGs was not confirmed, but general agreement on the putative phenotypic resistance profile by antimicrobial class was observed between RNA-Seq and SM-Seq.}

Other theorists defend an ‘early-onset’ account, suggesting that consciousness is likely to be in place at birth (or shortly after) and may even arise during the third trimester. Progress in this field has been difficult, not just because of the challenges associated with procuring the relevant behavioral and neural data, but also because of uncertainty about how best to study consciousness in the absence of the capacity for verbal report or intentional behavior. This review examines both the empirical and methodological progress in this field, arguing that recent research points in favor of early-onset accounts of the emergence of consciousness.}

Therefore, our ultimate aim is to synthesize physiologically accurate EEG data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this preliminary study, we first investigate how the choice of GAN hyperparameters influences the quality of simpler EEG-like generated signals. Thereto, we first created sinusoidal samples as target datasets with single (12 Hz), double (5, 12 Hz), or triple frequencies (5, 12, 28 Hz) and added Gaussian noise. We trained 2,592 models to generate fake sinusoidal samples and examined the effects of varying the hyperparameters batch size, learning rate of generator (LrG) and discriminator (LrD), and the number of epochs for vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and WGAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). We compared the distributions of relevant target and fake signal features, such as amplitude, phase, and signal-to-noise ratio, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Our results showed that WGAN-GP models had better training stability for sinusoidal sample generation compared to WGAN, and significantly outperformed vanilla GAN. Smaller batch sizes accelerated convergence at a fixed number of epochs. Matching LrG and LrD balanced networks during training. Increasing the number of epochs (up to 100) enhanced performance. We conclude that the WGAN-GP model provides the best quality signals, when hyperparameters, particularly learning rate, are well tuned. We therefore propose that effective combinations of hyperparameters enhance training stability and performance of GANs for EEG signal generation.}

abstract = {The appropriate selection of dry hobbing control parameters can significantly improve cutting performances such as energy consumption and time. To overcome the problems of manually setting the value range of control parameters and numerical oscillation of the optimization results (i.e. low stability), a hybrid optimization approach is proposed for the improvement of hobbing performances under user evaluation using K-means clustering, multi-objective hunger games search (MOHGS) and TOPSIS. Firstly, K-means clustering is applied to obtain the cluster centers and case clusters based on the historical cutting cases. Considering the problem of control parameters to be optimized, the numerical range of control parameters is determined via the cluster centers and case clusters. Then, MOHGS is developed and applied to search the non-inferior control parameters and run for many times based on the multi-target optimization model of dry hobbing. Finally, all the non-inferior control parameters obtained are ranked by TOPSIS method based on the user evaluation of cutting performances, and the control parameter ranking first is for machining. Compared with other well-known approaches, it is proved that the proposed approach can effectively resolve the control parameter optimization problem of dry hobbing under user evaluation and has high stability.}

Given this trend, the present research aims at studying the feasibility of adopting a transfer learning approach, within a collaborative prognostic framework, to support the maintenance servitization strategy of an Original Equipment Manufacturer. The maintenance task that the research focuses on is anomaly detection. The research is carried out considering the need for a cost-effective maintenance management solution delivered to support a fleet of assets. The application of the approach to an industrial case is correspondingly developed, allowing to validate the transfer learning approach in the context of an Original Equipment Manufacturer that provides an advanced maintenance service offering, and can leverage the proposed solution to create business-grade anomaly detection models, with limited effort in terms of resources and time. The validation allows to derive different managerial implications.}

abstract = {Background
In sub-Saharan Africa, the prevailing high ambient temperatures should warrant increased daily water intake (DWI) to prevent haemo-concentration and its potential to confound patients' laboratory data.
Aim
To assess the impact that the recommended DWI has on the haemato-biochemical variables in a tropical setting.
Materials and methods
This quasi-experimental study recruited 101 apparently healthy individuals (18–60 years) in the Bawku municipality. DWI, anthropometrics, and haemato-biochemical variables were assessed at baseline. Participants were encouraged to increase their DWI to ≥4 L over a 30-day period; haemato-biochemical variables were re-evaluated. Total body water (TBW) was anthropometrically estimated.
Results
The median post-treatment DWI significantly increased; consequently, anaemia cases increased by >20-fold (2.0 % vs 47.5 % post-treatment). RBC count, platelet count, WBC count, and median haemoglobin significantly decreased compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Biochemically, median plasma osmolality (p < 0.0001), serum sodium (p < 0.0001), serum potassium (p = 0.0012) and random blood sugar (p = 0.0403) significantly decreased. Compared to baseline, significantly higher proportion of participants classified as thrombocytopenic (8.9 % vs 3.0 %), hyponatraemia (10.9 % vs 2.0 %), or normal osmolarity (77.2 % vs 20.8 %). There were differential bivariate correlations between pre- and post-treatment haemato-biochemical variables.
Conclusion
Sub-optimal DWI is a likely confounder in haemato-biochemical data interpretation in the tropics.}
