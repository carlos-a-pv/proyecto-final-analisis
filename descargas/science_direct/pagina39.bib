abstract = {Providing effective writing feedback to students could promote students' writing development. However, offering high-quality feedback remains a significant challenge for pre-service teachers (PSTs). Recent advancements in GenAI technology may offer solutions to this issue. The study examines the influence of a short-term teaching intervention on the feedback levels and feedback types of PSTs' ChatGPT-assisted feedback on students' written compositions, utilizing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design with 30 PSTs. The quantitative results revealed significant improvements in both feedback levels (i.e., higher-level feedback issues including ideas and elaboration and style) and feedback types (e.g., explanations and general suggestions). Additionally, the findings highlighted specific strategies employed by PSTs when considering levels and types in combination. Subsequent interviews identified the underlying influential factors of these improvements, namely the improvements in ChatGPT usage skills (i.e., prompt engineering and source use) and a deeper understanding of the feedback process (i.e., introspection). By demonstrating how short-term teaching interventions can leverage PST's ability to use GenAI tools to provide writing feedback, this research advances the theoretical understanding of human-AI collaboration in the context of writing and provides pedagogical insights for teacher training programs.}

To address this need, Human Digital Twins (HDT) have gained notoriety in which human-related data is collected to feed other methodologies such as Lean manufacturing or cognitive deloading approaches. Together with concerns regarding data privacy and regulatory compliance, this imposes a formidable challenge. This work introduces a foundational HDT component designed to facilitate the human digital twinning process. With only a single camera and heavily relying on edge computing, this system uses deep learning image processing algorithms deployed on a Google Coral Dev Board, ensuring user anonymity and privacy while delivering near real-time performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of this cost-efficient solution, experiments were conducted in an industrial laboratory setting to assess its functionality as a navigation support system for warehouse picking. To the authors’ knowledge, no prior studies have utilized a single-camera depth-perception setup for human pose estimation in this context. The system achieved strong performance, estimating the third dimension of human pose keypoints with an absolute error below 0.11 meters and classifying tasks with 94% accuracy across diverse picking sequences and subjects.}

This study constructed a carbon-tracking framework integrating energy allocation analysis with the logarithmic mean Divisia index (EAA-LMDI). Using energy input-output tables, the authors derived the primary energy consumption responsibility conversion factor (KPECR), fossil fuel component factor (Kfossil), and primary CO2 emission factor (KC), and visualized carbon flows with Sankey diagrams. The approach captured hidden conversion losses across extraction, conversion, and end-use, and decomposed influencing factors of CO2 emissions for 27 economic and residential sectors during 2005–2020. Total CO2 responsibility increased from 5534 Mt in 2005 to 10,177 Mt in 2020, with 88 %–92 % from the economic sector. GDP per capita was the main driver (7788 Mt), while lower energy intensity (−2731 Mt) and declining Kfossil (−501 Mt) helped restrain growth. Between 2015 and 2020, the rebound of energy-intensive industries and rapid electrification offset the emissions reductions from economic restructuring. Although electrification is clean at the end-use stage, it increases upstream emissions, as over 60 % of electricity still comes from coal. Improved coal-fired unit efficiency reduced the electricity's KPECR, avoiding 88 Mt of emissions. Policy priorities include: (1) flexibility retrofits of coal-fired power plants with industrial waste-heat recovery; (2) tighter controls to avert cyclical overcapacity in heavy industry; and (3) cross-sector digital platforms for energy-carbon coordination. The EAA-LMDI framework links sectoral behaviour and technical change, providing a robust analytical tool for multi-stage decarbonization pathways in coal-dependent economies.}

The writing experiments in this study considered how to effectively and ethically work with generative AI to produce culturally appropriate EFL teaching materials. The experiments involved co-producing moral dilemmatic stories with ChatGPT to support a new Chinese EFL curriculum unit on “Morals and Virtues”. We draw on Lo's (2023a, 2023b) CLEAR framework for prompt engineering to generate appropriate stimulus materials. We refer to Durkheim's (1961) sociological theory on morality and Bernstein's (1971, 1981, 2003) concept of framing to unpack how moral decisions might be framed as dilemmas in particular sociocultural contexts. We then mobilize Martin and White's (2005) appraisal framework to uncover the patterns of cultural biases embedded in the AI-generated text. We propose a two-step “Navigation and Generation” method for effective prompt engineering with generative AI: first navigating the AI chatbot to a clear and consistent positioning around a concept, and then requesting the AI chatbot to generate text based on the clarifications generated in the first step. Our appraisal analysis indicates that WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich, and democratic) cultural values are embedded in moral dilemmatic stories generated by ChatGPT. EFL Teachers need to be aware of how these values are presented to encourage critical cultural awareness in their students.}

To gain a better understanding of the underlying atmospheric processes of torrential Meiyu rainfall, we investigated the moisture sources and isotopic composition of the 2020 extraordinary and persistent Meiyu rainfall in the Yangtze River valley from June 19 to July 10 using an isotopic regional spectral model. During the Meiyu period, significant amounts of Indian Ocean moisture were transported to Yangtze River valley by Indian monsoonal southwesterlies, especially in the middle levels between 850 hPa and 600 hPa. Whereas moderate amounts of East Asian continent moisture were distributed principally within the boundary layer below 850 hPa. Besides, tiny amounts of South China Sea moisture were transported by the western Pacific subtropical high to the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River valley within the boundary layer below 900 hPa. With respect to isotopic characteristics, the lowest δ2H and the highest d-excess values of the Indian Ocean moisture were attributable to more rainout and below-cloud evaporation during long-distance transport. In contrast, the isotopic signals of the East Asian continent moisture and the South China Sea moisture were relatively preserved. The 2020 Meiyu rainfall exhibited significant intraseasonal variability and was classified into heavy and light Meiyu periods based on rainfall amount. Heavy Meiyu rainfall with northward migration were characterized by enhanced Indian Ocean moisture with lower δ2H and higher d-excess, resulting from the westward expansion of the western Pacific subtropical high and the deepened East Asian mid-latitude trough.}

Through an international survey of energy-sector and sustainability professionals (n = 179), we investigated the desirable sustainability features for renewable hydrogen SCLs and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of sustainability certification. Our mixed-method study revealed general accordance on the feasible inclusion of diverse sustainability criteria in SCLs, albeit with varying degrees of perceived essentiality. Within the confines of the data, some differences in viewpoints emerged based on respondents’ geographical and supply chain locations, which were associated with the sharing of costs and benefits. Qualitatively, respondents found the idea of SCL harmonisation attractive but weighed this against the risks of duplication, complicated administrative procedures, and contradictory regulation. The implications of this research centre on the need for further studies to inform policy recommendations for an overarching SCL sustainability framework that embodies the principles of harmonisation in the context of multistakeholder governance.}

abstract = {Restaurants are swiftly embracing automation to prepare food, experimenting with innovations from robotic arms for frying foods to pizza-making robots. While these advances promise to enhance efficiency and productivity, their impact on consumer psychology remains largely unexplored. We present four experiments that demonstrate how food service automation leads to negative downstream effects (i.e., diminished taste perceptions, decreased willingness to pay, less favorable attitudes towards food items) across multiple food categories. This stems in part from two distinct contagion effects, whereby automation appears to undermine the food's ability to contain symbolic love (positive contagion from human contact) while simultaneously increasing feelings of disgust (negative contagion from machine contact). Moreover, we highlight how communicating the consumer-oriented benefits of automation can suppress the disgust associated with automation and subsequently mitigate the deleterious effects on consumer evaluations. Our findings suggest that service retailers should consider the psychological impact on consumers when shifting away from human involvement in a category as intimate and consequential as the production of our food.}

abstract = {Background
Approximately 39% of young people (aged 16-24 y) experience mental ill health, but only 23% seek professional help. Early intervention is essential for reducing the impacts of mental illness, but young people, particularly those from culturally diverse communities, report experiencing shame and stigma, which can deter them from engaging with face-to-face services. Digital mental health (DMH) tools promise to increase access, but there is a lack of literature exploring the suitability of DMH tools for culturally diverse populations.
Objective
The project was conducted in partnership with a large-scale national DMH organization that promotes evidence-based early intervention, treatment, and support of mental health in young people and their families. The organization wanted to develop a self-directed web-based platform for parents and young people that integrates psychological assessments and intervention pathways via a web-based “check-in” tool. Our project explored the views of culturally diverse parents and young people on the opportunities and barriers to engagement with a web-based DMH screening tool.
Methods
We conducted a 2-phase qualitative study aiming to identify potential issues faced by culturally diverse communities when engaging with DMH tools designed for the Australian public. We worked with 18 culturally diverse participants (parents: n=8, 44%; young people: n=10, 56%) in a series of design-led workshops drawing on methods from speculative design and user experience to understand the opportunities and barriers that organizations might face when implementing population-level DMH tools with culturally diverse communities. NVivo was used to conduct thematic analyses of the audio-recorded and transcribed workshop data.
Results
Five themes were constructed from the workshops: (1) trust in the use and application of a DMH tool, (2) data management and sharing, (3) sociocultural influences on mental health, (4) generational differences in mental health and digital literacy, and (5) stigma and culturally based discrimination in mental health support.
Conclusions
The emergent themes have important considerations for researchers wishing to develop more inclusive DMH tools. The study found that healthy parent-child relationships will increase engagement in mental health support for young persons from culturally diverse backgrounds. Barriers to engagement with DMH tools included culturally based discrimination, the influence of culture on mental health support, and the potential impact of a diagnostic label on help seeking. The study’s findings suggest a need for culturally safe psychoeducation for culturally diverse end users that fosters self-determination with tailored resources. They also highlight important key challenges when working with culturally diverse populations.}

Drawing on expectation violation theory, the present study examines how user expectations, informed by belief in machine heuristics and concerns over human uniqueness, impact chatbot loyalty through a moderated mediation framework. A questionnaire survey of 900 participants in China revealed that belief in machine capabilities bolsters users' perceptions of machine intelligence, which in turn, enhances user loyalty. Interestingly, when users encounter service failures that challenge their expectations, their perceived intelligence of the chatbot intensifies rather than diminishes. In contrast, expectations shaped by human uniqueness concerns diminish users' perceptions of machine intelligence and, consequently, their loyalty, which remains consistent regardless of the encounter with AI failure. The study also delves into the theoretical contributions of these findings to the evolution of expectation violation theory within the sphere of human-robot interaction.}

However, ASAS systems on such basis have seen limited adoption in authentic teaching environments due to the models’ inability to explain the predictions they generate. To address this, we recruited 32 human graders to comparatively analyse the decision-making processes of human graders and AI-driven graders. Specifically, we exploited two types of data to holistically unveil the decision-making processes of human graders throughout grading, namely manual annotation of important words and gaze data of the human graders. The decision-making processes of AI-driven graders were revealed by important words extracted though eXplainable Artificial Intelligence technique and grading confidence reflected by the prediction probability distributions. We measured the alignment in their decision-making regarding their (i) estimated scoring difficulty, (ii) important text segments and (iii) crucial grammatical categories to enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven graders. Subsequently, we conducted randomised control studies, presenting machine-extracted insights like important words and estimated scoring difficulty to scrutinise how they affected human grading. Our findings contribute new knowledge regarding the consistency between human and machine scoring and validates machine-extracted insights, such as important words and scoring difficulty, to be valuable in facilitating human grading, encouraging the adoption of ASAS systems and urging the potential collaboration between machine and human grading in pedagogical practices. However, we emphasised the significance of grasping question context and intricacy before leveraging such machine-extracted insights.}

Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks.

abstract = {With the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the number of public charging piles cannot meet the immediate charging needs of EV users sometimes. The charging stations provide flexible electricity transaction schemes for users by managing charging piles and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V). Users can freely choose transaction partners and submit transaction plans to multiple charging stations. The mobility of EVs results in users randomly selecting rings multiple times, which may cause them to appear in different rings. Attackers can link multiple transaction plans and infer user privacy information. The leakage of transaction information may threaten the fairness of transactions. Aiming at the above situations, a privacy protection scheme to resist ring selection attack in Peer-to-Peer double auction V2V electricity transaction for charging stations is proposed. Firstly, the ring signcryption algorithm is improved to resist ring selection attack. Secondly, a real identity verification algorithm is designed to track malicious users. Theoretical analysis proves that the security of the proposed privacy protection scheme. The elliptic curve point multiplication is used in the scheme to improve computational efficiency. Experiments show that this scheme has low computational and communication costs. Verification cost increases slowly with the increase of the number of ring members.}

abstract = {The technological capabilities of Human Resource Analytics (HRA), enhanced by recent innovations in Machine Learning (ML), offer exciting opportunities. However, organisations often fail to realise these potentials because of a limited understanding of why individuals choose to adopt or disregard respective tools. Prior research on innovation adoption offers preliminary insights but fails to aggregate the determinants of individual adoption into actionable suggestions for decisions in the ML adoption process. Our study applies focused interviews to examine non-ML experts' reasoning for using a specific tool tailored to a public sector organisation, which corresponds to the usual end-user perspective of ML-based HRA adoption. By drawing from the HRA adoption framework, provided by Vargas et al. (2018), we contribute to the literature by identifying relevant beliefs and experiences influencing one's intention to adopt ML-based HRA and by qualitatively linking these beliefs to ML characteristics such as transparency, automation and fairness. For practitioners, we provide actionable guidance emphasising the need to ensure fairness proactively, as interviewees do not consider this aspect when deciding to adopt ML-based HRA.}

This study, grounded in social exchange theory and international relationship marketing research, investigates how cross-border national distances between exchange dyad influence the effect of firm and sales-rep commitment on both the seller's and the buyer's benefits. Using survey data from international buyers across 29 countries (regions) and secondary national distance indices, we find that the buyer's sales-rep commitment, like firm commitment, positively impacts both the seller's sales share performance and the buyer's special treatment benefits. Furthermore, we find that cross-border economic and cultural distances can weaken the positive effect of firm commitment, while cultural distance strengthens the positive effect of sales-rep commitment. These findings contribute novel insights to social exchange theory by shedding light on the significance of both firm and sales-rep commitment and provide practical recommendations for firms to leverage commitment in managing their international buyers.}

Digitalized shopfloors can leverage an unprecedented availability of data for better and faster decision-making, resulting in enhanced operational performance. However, limited research has investigated the organizational and individual implications for those who run the manufacturing lines: production managers, supervisors, team leaders, and workers. By adopting a socio-technical framework, this study aims to disentangle the effects that digitalization has on shopfloors’ organizational structures, decision-making processes, and individual competencies, as well as the interdependencies among them. An exploratory approach was adopted, based on an empirical cross-country study involving 34 semi-structured interviews conducted in the Italian and Spanish automotive sectors. Analyzed through the lenses of information-processing, knowledge-based, and dynamic capability theories, our findings reveal through five propositions how digitalization induces a “polarization” of operational decision-making: shopfloors are run by knowledgeable data-empowered production managers and autonomous information-processing team leaders on the front line, with a reduced importance of supervisors. Upskilling needs appear for team leaders but not production workers, whose involvement, however, emerges as a key factor for a successful digitalization and overall performance in initial DT stages. This study contributes to literature on digitalization by exposing managerial tensions and dynamic capabilities, along with a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of DT in terms of implications for shop-floor decision-makers. Managerial implications are directed at creating awareness about the centrality of production team leaders, and future research avenues are proposed.}

Following a targeted literature review, it dives into the specific context of AI in finance, highlighting current applications and potential pitfalls. It examines existing doctrinal and regulatory challenges encountered in governing AI, drawing comparisons, and identifying discrepancies across different regions. It further illuminates additional concerns specific to generative AI, such as bias, transparency, and accountability. In response to these concerns, some solutions for regulating generative AI are proposed, underpinned by principles that prioritize human rights, ethical considerations, and sustainability. The establishment of a global AI body to facilitate coordinated and effective oversight is also suggested. Access to justice, ethical considerations, and human rights remain central throughout the proposed approach. Ultimately, this chapter advocates for a nuanced and human-centered regulatory landscape for generative AI, ensuring its responsible application within the financial services market and beyond.}

We investigate whether confirmation bias (through prior audit opinions) occurs among auditors during the audit process and decision-making, and whether experience mitigates this effect. A total of 175 non-experienced auditors run a 2x4 between-subjects experiment (experiment 1) studying how financial information (IV with two levels: negative and neutral/positive) and previous audit report (IV with four levels: absence, negative, moderately negative, and positive) might influence the issuance of the subsequent decision-making (DV). In addition, a total of 32 junior level 1 auditors (less than one year of experience), 31 junior level 2 auditors (up to 3 years of experience) and 20 senior auditors (more than 3 years of experience) run a 2 × 4 × 3 between-subjects experiment (experiment 2) analyzing if experience (IV with three levels of experience: less than one-year, between one and three years, more than three years) mitigates this effect (experiment 2). Results confirm that the previous-year audit report affect auditors' current assessment, showing that positive and negative prior opinions persuade auditors when suggesting the next one. This finding is relevant as auditors' opinions could be conditioned by prior opinions instead of their own expertise. Our evidence also suggests that professional experience mitigates this influence on auditors' assessments. Consequently, this study has relevant implications for partners, audit professionals and audit firm recruiters. A general implication is that auditor training courses should reinforce the auditor's own expertise and criteria based on the deep analysis of financial and economic data rather than on the work of previous auditors.}

This study develops a novel calculation model for sluice gate flow in both free and submerged conditions by examining the complete energy–momentum equations and taking into account factors such as section contraction, velocity uniformity, and energy loss. Numerical simulations were subsequently conducted to establish equations for the contraction coefficient, Coriolis, Boussinesq, and energy loss coefficient. Finally, a sluice gate flow experiment was conducted, and the results of this and previous experiments were used to compare the performance of the proposed model with that of simplified energy–momentum equation models as well as the Henry, Swamee, Simulation of Irrigation Canals, and Specification models. The results indicate that the smallest prediction error, measured at just 4.51 %, was demonstrated by the proposed model, which also exhibited the lowest sensitivity to the submergence degree. Therefore, this study advances the theoretical understanding of free and submerged flows and offers a valuable reference informing flow measurements during irrigation and flood discharge processes.}

The results of the quantitative analysis indicate that the majority are empirical works. The qualitative analysis is a co-word analysis providing the following results: (i) classification of authors by major themes-categories (EI, leadership, team), (ii) classification of themes within each major theme: three subcategories in EI, 17 subcategories in leadership, and 19 subcategories in team and, lastly, (iii) classification according to the chronological development of main objectives from the most cited authors' articles we analyzed. Leadership (transformational, emergence, virtual, effective, health, effectiveness) is the major theme we studied. Our in-depth review of the articles has shown that emotionally intelligent leaders improve both behaviors and business results and have an impact on work team performance. It also highlighted a positive relationship between emotional competence and team members’ attitudes about work. The new trends focus on the impacts of COVID19, the global crisis due to the Ukraine War, working in VUCA and BANI environments, comparative studies between generations, the application of artificial intelligence and the influence of mindfulness on organizations.}

However, an increased demand and availability of these tools do not imply a successful switch from traditional to AI-supported learning. In this work, ChatGMP, a chatbot leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) able to conduct an interview exercise in a Master's Degree course taught at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is introduced. The exercise consists in a student interview of a fictitious company, represented by the teachers or ChatGMP, regarding its Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). The aim is for the students to ask sensible and well-reasoned questions to acquire the necessary documentation to make an exhaustive report indicating whether the company is a potential fit for business. To evaluate the initiative, we compare the performance of ChatGMP to the one of the physical teachers of the course, as well as the perception of the students towards it. The results show no significant difference in the information provided by the teachers and the model, enabling the students to achieve similar learning. The students that interacted with ChatGMP are satisfied with the initiative and would likely recommend future students to perform the audit with the digital tool. This initial experiment and its positive results lay the foundation for opening the discussion on how to use LLMs in education, the opportunities they could provide, as well as their limitations and drawbacks.}

Drawing on the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm and the uncanny valley effect (UVE), we propose a moderated dual mediation model. This model is empirically tested using two experimental studies. The results reveal distinct pathways by which cognitive and affective empathy affect approach-avoidance intentions. Specifically, cognitive empathy primarily influences approach-avoidance intentions via perceived novelty, whereas affective empathy exerts its effect through perceived warmth. Additionally, perceived warmth and eeriness together mediate the impact of affective empathy on approach-avoidance intentions. Notably, mindful AI agents strengthen the effect of affective empathy on the UVE but diminish the influence of cognitive empathy on approach-avoidance intentions, relative to mindless agents. These findings provide important insights for AI designers and companies seeking to develop empathetic, user-centered conversational agents for mental health applications.}

In this overview, we scrutinized the occurrence of the most relevant judgmental biases affecting forecasting across 162 papers, drawing from four recent reviews and papers published in forecasting journals, specifically focusing on the use of algorithms. Thirty-three of the 162 papers (20.4%) at least briefly mentioned one of twelve judgmental biases affecting forecasting. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that algorithms can potentially mitigate the adverse impacts of biases inherent in human judgment related to forecasting. Furthermore, these algorithms can leverage biases as an advantage, enhancing forecast accuracy. Intriguing revelations have surfaced, focusing mainly on four biases. By providing timely, relevant, well-performing, and consistent algorithmic advice, people can be effectively influenced to improve their forecasts, considering anchoring, availability, inconsistency, and confirmation bias. The findings highlight the gaps in the current research landscape and provide recommendations for practitioners.

The objective of this article is to prioritize technologies, innovations, and new businesses related to the leather agroindustrial chain in the department of Quindío (Colombia) for the year 2035.
Method
The prospective scenario and Delphi methods were used to prioritize key variables, technologies, actors, innovations, objectives, and scenarios in the leather agroindustry. As a previous phase, the Scopus database was used with the critical factors of leather, tanning, tanneries, tannery, leather transformation, cowhide, and suede, and the results were used as input for structured, anonymous and reiterative consultations with national and international experts on topics related to the chain and with a time horizon of 2035. The questionnaire was posed by groupings, including product and by-product innovation, sustainability, technology, and genetics, and, for the first round of the Delphi method, was sent to more than 70 national and industry experts/stakeholders, representatives of universities, the public and private sectors, and organizations related to the chain.
Findings
After conducting a bibliometric analysis, key terms related to the leather sector were visualized and a validation was made for MICMAC methods, with 44 variables found; with topics ranging from raw materials to current regulations. For the MACTOR method, future objectives were determined for clean technologies, the creation of new product development, and an R&D&I Center for productive transformation. Meanwhile, for the Delphi method, 44 technologies and innovations were prioritized through rounds with complementary analysis using Python and natural language processing.
Conclusions
Topics such as vegan leather made, from mushrooms; bio-leather or leather made, from mango peel; nanofibers, nanocomposites, biogas production, nanofiltration, 4D Printing, Artificial Intelligence to improve leather quality; augmented reality to improve customer experience; genetic improvement of animals to improve leather quality, among others, in which innovation challenges and open innovation strategies can be generated, as well as in R&D&I projects, were identified.}

The FTIR technique was used to identify the characteristic functional group of the prepared spinel structure. The optical band gap of Zn1-xPbxAl2O4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2 mol %) ceramic powder was found to increase from 3.65 eV to 4.36 eV with an increase in Pb2+ content. The prominent emission was observed in the violet-blue region (387 nm) after exciting the sample at 270 nm. The impedance data has been analyzed to explore the dielectric constant (k), dissipation loss factor (DF), and ac conductivity. The observed violet-blue emission and improved dielectric behavior endorse the potential applications of Zn1-xPbxAl2O4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2 mol %) ceramic powder in UV sensors.}

To fill this gap, following a realist perspective of entrepreneurship, this article examines digital opportunities as profit propensities afforded by a digitalized environment, while treating digital innovation and transformation as the actualization process. To elaborate, first, we coin Digitalized Opportunity Space (DOS) to describe the digitalized environment as a critical intersection of four spaces - resource, utility, digital, and institutional- that muster conditions without which digital opportunities cannot be actualized. Second, we develop four managerial archetypes - resource orchestrators, utility integrators, digital evangelists, and institutional realists- who tend to recognize digital opportunities based on their organizational location and thereby endorse different digital innovations. Third, to facilitate a systemic and balanced approach to digital transformation, we recommend group-level heuristics - the generic density perspective, the ecosystem view of the firm, multi-dimensional network effects, and disciplined imagination- which restore totality from partiality. Taken together, the DOS framework (of opportunity generation), the managerial archetypes (of opportunity recognition), and the group-level heuristics (of opportunity actualization) constitute the opportunity-centric (vs technology-centric or organization-centric) perspective on digital innovation and transformation, thereby materializing the connection between digital literature and entrepreneurship.}

Furthermore, it proposes a novel unsupervised topic labeling procedure to address the limitations in current topic modeling interpretations, which are often not fully unsupervised. The procedure comprised automatic generation of labels that directly support opportunity modeling and facilitate product design development. To achieve the stated objectives, data was collected from user comments on YouTube car reviews and analyzed using various algorithms and part-of-speech rules, finding that Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with noun-adjective combinations proved most effective in generating comprehensible topic labels and capturing emotional expressions. The results revealed six underserved labels, one served right, and two overserved categories for new vehicle design improvements, providing valuable insights into user experiences. The insights provided in this context are expected to contribute to the potential improvement of vehicle attribute designs, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the entire design process.}

In this study, we empirically analyze 472 live streams to explore the curvilinear effects of the number of products and stay time on livestream shopping sales. Our findings suggest an inverted U-shaped relationship between the total number of products and the average audience stay time with sales. Moreover, we find that these relationships are contingent on the total duration of the stream and the age of the streamer.

In addition, some dedicated mobile apps can capture driving and diagnostic data from a vehicle via a Bluetooth-enabled OBD-II scanner. In this paper, we propose a new process for effective automotive forensics. It collects and analyzes three different types of data left on an Android phone which has been connected to the OBD-II port of a vehicle via Bluetooth communication. The three types of data are OBD-II Android apps' data, Bluetooth HCI snoop log, and the main log buffer of the Android logging system. By analyzing them individually and integratedly, we find Bluetooth connection time, vehicle information, MAC address of the OBD-II scanner, vehicle velocity, sharp speeding event, sudden braking event, refueling event, and so on. We also construct a timeline of Bluetooth traffic and driving events through the timeline analysis, which can be used to determine the driver's behaviors in terms of vehicle forensics.}

However, delegating decisions to AI is challenging, especially in contexts that go beyond classical optimization problems. Current research has so far largely neglected to include the viewpoints of the decision-affected and of surrogate decision-makers in the discussion. To address these gaps, in this study we rely on two experimental designs and complement our findings with qualitative interview data to shed light on both sides: the perspective of those affected by the decision and that of the decision maker in surrogate and ethically complex decision contexts. Findings reveal that the individual decision-making perspective may lead to opposing perceptions. Whereas the willingness to delegate an ethically challenging decision to AI in a surrogate decision context is lower than that in a non-surrogate context (decision-maker perspective), people affected by the decision do not generally prefer humans to AI (decision-affected perspective). By these findings, we contribute to the literature on AI-enabled decision-making and decision delegation to non-human entities.}

In response to signaling cues, they differentiate to phenotypes with robust capacities to synthesize and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling molecules. Although activated fibroblast phenotypes are associated with pronounced changes in metabolism, it remains unclear how the metabolic network upholds the effector functions of fibroblasts in the infarcted heart. We found that two enzymes that could facilitate a phosphoenolpyruvate cycle, i.e. pyruvate kinase muscle isoform 2 (PKM2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (PCK2), are elevated in the heart after MI. Although Pck2 deletion had no effect on post-MI remodeling, fibroblast-specific switching of Pkm2 to Pkm1 (fbPkm2 → 1) mitigated ventricular dilation, wall thinning, and losses in ejection fraction caused by MI. Despite these salutary effects, fbPkm2 → 1 switching did not alter cardiac fibrosis in vivo, nor did it affect collagen production, cytokine or chemokine secretion, myofibroblast differentiation markers, or transcriptional regulation in vitro. Nevertheless, Pkm2 → 1 splice variant switching increased myofibroblast contractile activity as well as influenced the metabolic phenotype of fibroblasts, as shown by increased pyruvate kinase activity, higher mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and elevation in glycolytic intermediate abundance. Despite these changes, Pkm2 → 1 switching had relatively minor effects on glucose carbon fate, as determined by stable isotope-resolved metabolomics. Nevertheless, these metabolic data demonstrate that cardiac fibroblasts exhibit minimal glucose-supported de novo glycine synthesis in vitro, yet possess high hexosamine and glucuronate biosynthetic pathway activity. Collectively, these findings reveal that fibroblast PKM isoforms influence post-MI remodeling, highlighting pyruvate kinase as a potential therapeutic target.}

Based on the practice-based view framework and the characteristics of Chinese semiconductor industry, we investigate how DT affects GTI. Utilizing data from 191 Chinese semiconductor firms during 2014–2022, we draw empirical evidence that DT has positive effects on GTI and the positive effects are more pronounced in non-state-owned enterprises than in state-owned enterprises. Interestingly, media coverage and executive compensation incentives weaken the positive effects. These findings advance the literatures of GTI and practice-based view and offer valuable managerial implications to enhancing GTI of Chinese semiconductor firms.}

abstract = {Background
Cochlear implants are implanted hearing devices; instead of amplifying sounds like common hearing aids, this technology delivers preprocessed sound information directly to the hearing (ie, auditory) nerves. After surgery and the first cochlear implant activation, patients must practice interpreting the new auditory sensations, especially for language comprehension. This rehabilitation process is accompanied by hearing therapy through face-to-face training with a therapist, self-directed training, and computer-based auditory training.
Objective
In general, self-directed, computer-based auditory training tasks have already shown advantages. However, compliance of cochlear implant recipients is still a major factor, especially for self-directed training at home. Hence, we aimed to explore the combination of 2 techniques to enhance learner motivation in this context: adaptive learning (in the form of an intelligent tutoring system) and game-based learning (in the form of a serious game).
Methods
Following the suggestions of the evidence-centered design framework, a domain analysis of hearing therapy was conducted, allowing us to partially describe human hearing skill as a probabilistic competence model (Bayesian network). We developed an algorithm that uses such a model to estimate the current competence level of a patient and create training recommendations. For training, our developed task system was based on 7 language comprehension task types that act as a blueprint for generating tasks of diverse difficulty automatically. To achieve this, 1053 audio assets with meta-information labels were created. We embedded the adaptive task system into a graphic novel–like mobile serious game. German-speaking cochlear implant recipients used the system during a feasibility study for 4 weeks.
Results
The 23 adult participants (20 women; 3 men) fulfilled 2259 tasks. In total, 2004 (90.5%) tasks were solved correctly, and 255 (9.5%) tasks were solved incorrectly. A generalized additive model analysis of these tasks indicated that the system adapted to the estimated competency levels of the cochlear implant recipients more quickly in the beginning than at the end. Compared with a uniform distribution of all task types, the recommended task types differed (χ²6=86.713; P<.001), indicating that the system selected specific task types for each patient. This is underlined by the identified categories for the error proportions of the task types.
Conclusions
This contribution demonstrates the feasibility of combining an intelligent tutoring system with a serious game in cochlear implant rehabilitation therapies. The findings presented here could lead to further advances in cochlear implant care and aural rehabilitation in general.

abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing number of industries relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposes an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words. Compared with the existing approaches, our proposed framework is based on the perspective of human psychology with higher credibility and significant theoretical support. In addition, we purposefully design and implement an intuitive visualisation for the framework, instead of complex numerical representations, to improve the explanation comprehensibility for a broader audience.}

Articles 3 and 4 of European Union Directive 2019/790 and sections 243 and 244 of Singapore’s Copyright Act of 2021 are examples. Both exceptions are subject to the condition of ‘lawful access’. The interpretation of this concept, which is vague and undefined by law, is crucial to these exceptions, as it may, ultimately, deprive them of all usefulness. This paper seeks to unpack the meaning of lawful access and its inverse by drawing on other uses of the concept, namely in cybercrime law, and its underlying values. This analysis points towards an understanding of unlawful access as the circumvention of technological restrictions to access, such as paywalls. However, adopting such measures may reduce the content that is freely available in the digital sphere, thereby impoverishing society and depriving creators of a powerful tool for publicising their works. Finally, the paper considers possible solutions to this problem and their drawbacks.}

Using the time-varying difference-in-differences model, this study explores the synergies of this program across 284 cities from 2009 to 2019. The findings are as follows: (1) With environmental information disclosed, the national air quality monitoring program can reduce the outdoor fine particulate matter concentration by an overall effect of 3.31%, equivalent to an almost 1% reduction calculated by its average value. (2) This program can enhance public environmental attention and stimulate environmental practitioners’ employment, thereby achieving a synergistic effect on air pollution reduction. (3) The pollution reduction effect is expected to be more pronounced in cities located in the southern and eastern regions, cities with higher population densities, and cities with favourable ventilation capabilities. (4) In response to air pollution problems, the public will adjust their daily consumption patterns to avoid potential health risks. As a result of the short-term behavioural changes, they will be more willing to pay for clean air by purchasing household air purifiers. This study highlights the considerable ecological and economic benefits of environmental information disclosure, thus further contributing to future eco-friendly and sustainable development.}

It offers new insights on how ESG constraints affect performance and risk in dynamic portfolios, accounting for time-varying correlations of responsible assets. The paper uses a quantitative approach by considering two models: one using only Markowitz’s theory about mean–variance (MV) optimality without considering the ESG criteria, and another model with a constraint that enforces a minimum acceptable threshold in ESG scores, named here as MV-ESG. The minimum spanning tree (MST) method was adopted for correlation network construction, and it would consider studying dynamic correlation structures on two different periods: crisis and post-crisis. The data used are the closing prices of companies listed on the Casablanca stock exchange (CSE), obtained from their official website, while the ESG scores were obtained from Refinitiv. The results show that responsible portfolios (RPs), optimized by traditional and network approaches, are neither more profitable nor less volatile than their conventional counterparts, with the exception of peripheral portfolios (Pp), which show more attractive profitability in the responsible case, but at the cost of higher risk. While the network approach has facilitated better opportunities for higher returns, reduced losses, and better ESG scores than the traditional method, the results show that in a social orientation crisis, performance will be unfavorable; it has not been able to provide positive returns during this period.}

The study collected a dataset of 702 videos and 67,568 comments from TikTok, Kwai, and Bilibili. Through interaction index, sentiment analysis, and BERTopic theme modeling, it measured audience interaction dynamics. The findings reveal that in the process of urban virality, social media-driven emotional resonance emerges as the core factor driving active interaction. However, cognitive conflicts arising from excessive commercial penetration have become prominent with capital expansion and market competition. Notably, audience sentiment scores exhibit a stepped decline across cities from Zibo to Harbin and Tianshui, a trend that profoundly exposes the development paradox of accelerated society. This study constructs a novel theoretical framework that integrates digital technology interaction with social acceleration, unveiling the developmental dynamics of internet-famous tourist city and guiding tourism development toward the goal of fostering a good life.}

abstract = {Internet data centers (IDCs) are critical infrastructures supporting the digital economy, necessitating stable and resilient energy supply to ensure continuous operation and meet increasing computational demands. This study develops an advanced optimization framework. The framework improves IDC energy efficiency by leveraging their spatio-temporal flexibility for intelligent participation in power system operations. The proposed framework employs a diversified energy portfolio comprising combined heat and power (CHP) units, fuel cells (FCs), locally controllable generators (LCGs), and renewable energy sources (RESs), to reduce reliance on the main grid while maintaining operational reliability. To address supply and demand uncertainties, robust optimization (RO) is applied. Furthermore, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used for feature selection and engineering, identifying key parameters influencing IDC behavior. These features are fed into a Transformer-based machine learning model, which captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies and provides accurate forecasts. The predictions are then incorporated into the RO-based decision-making process to support real-time energy optimization. The proposed framework is validated on the IEEE 33-bus standard distribution network, simulating realistic IDC operation scenarios. Results demonstrate the superiority of the model, achieving at least 35.3% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE), reduced to 16.22 kWh, and 16.7% improvement in root mean square error (RMSE), reduced to 33.56 kWh, compared to conventional ML models. Additionally, the proposed model is evaluated by the other KPIs of root mean square relative error (RMSRE=0.35), mean square relative error (MSRE=0.12), mean absolute relative error (MARE=0.16), normalized RMSE (nRMSE=0.14), and normalized MAE (nMAE=0.08). These findings confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework in enhancing IDC operational efficiency.}

Despite recognition, gaps persist in understanding historical enrollment patterns and contextual factors influencing female enrollment in Tanzanian mathematics Master's programs. This research addresses these gaps through a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative analysis using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for enrollment forecasting reveals nuanced dynamics in female enrollment, enhancing precision in predictions. Specifically, the ARIMA(0,1,1) model predicts the constant change of future values beyond the available data, while the prediction interval indicates enrollment fluctuations, gradually decreasing within the confidence intervals, and considering the simulated features. Qualitative document analysis provides contextual insights into socio-economic and policy-related factors, such as cultural attitudes, societal norms, educational policies, availability of female role models, level of support, and gender biases. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model comprehensively analyzes the impact of these (contextual) factors on the probability of female enrollment. Essentially, the prioritization of efforts should commence with addressing educational policies, promoting female role models, increasing support mechanisms, challenging cultural attitudes and societal norms, and addressing gender biases with nuanced strategies. Eventually, this study offers a cohesive understanding of female enrollment dynamics, providing a foundation for targeted interventions and policies to foster gender diversity in Tanzanian mathematics Master's programs.}

abstract = {With the trends of technology convergence and technology interdisciplinarity, technology-field (TF) resolution and classification of patents have gradually been challenged. Whether for patent applicants or for patent examiners, more precisely labeling the TF for a certain patent is important for technological searches. However, determining the TF of a patent may be difficult and may even involve the strategic behavior of patenting, which can cause noise in patent classification systems (PCSs). In addition, some specific patents could contain more TFs than claimed or be assigned questionable IPC codes; subsequently, in a regular search for technology/patents, information could be missed. Considering the advantages of deep learning compared with traditional machine learning algorithms in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), text classification and text sentiment analysis, this paper investigates several popular deep learning models and proposes a large-scale multilabel regression (MLR) model to handle specific patent analyses under situations of small sample learning. To verify the proposed MLR model for patent classification, the case study on smart cities and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is conducted. The MLR experiments on the TF resolution of smart cities and IIoT have yielded moderate results compared with those of the latest patent classification studies, which also rely on deep learning and the large language models (LLMs), which include RCNN, Bi-LSTM, BERT and GPT-4 etc. Therefore, the proposed MLR model with a customized loss function could be moderately effective for patent classification within a specific technology theme, could have implications for patent classification and the TF resolution of patents, and could further enrich methodologies for patent mining and informetrics based on artificial intelligence (AI).}

abstract = {Background
Surgical lighting systems (SLSs) provide optimal lighting conditions for operating room personnel. Current systems are mainly adjusted by hand; surgeons either accommodate the light themselves or communicate their requirements to an assistant to ensure optimal surgical conditions. This poses challenges to maintaining sterility, proper accessibility, and illumination and can lead to potential collision problems. Furthermore, the personnel operating the light may not have deep medical knowledge or equipment expertise.
Objective
This paper introduces a touch-free interaction concept for controlling an SLS using speech and gestures.
Methods
We used an iterative, user-centered design approach with participatory design sessions. This process involved conducting a literature review, several observations of actual surgical sites, and engaging stakeholders through interviews and focus groups. In addition, we carried out 2 user studies: one in a virtual reality setup and another in a living laboratory environment.
Results
Our findings indicate that our interaction concept is a viable alternative for controlling an SLS. Despite some technical limitations, surgical experts found the system intuitive and useful, recognizing the significant potential for touch-free lighting adjustments in the operating room. The combination of speech and gesture modalities was seen as helpful and even necessary, with some interactions better suited to one modality over the other. Offering both modalities for each interaction provided greater flexibility.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that our proposed touch-free interaction concept can enhance surgical conditions and has the potential to replace traditional adjustment.}

We ensure the reliability of TUMSyn by constructing a brain MRI database comprising 31,407 3D images across 7 MRI modalities from 13 worldwide centers and pre-training an MRI-specific text encoder to process text prompts effectively. Experiments on diverse datasets and physician assessments indicate that TUMSyn-generated images can be utilized along with acquired MRI scan(s) to facilitate large-scale MRI-based screening and diagnosis of multiple brain diseases, substantially reducing the time and cost of MRI in the healthcare system.}

The multifaceted nature of combustion research emphasizes the critical role of knowledge processing in navigating and extracting valuable information from a vast and diverse pool of sources. The developed approach minimizes computational and economic expenses while optimizing data privacy and accuracy. It incorporates prompt engineering and offline open-source LLMs, offering user autonomy in selecting base models. The study provides a thorough examination of text segmentation strategies, conducts comparative studies between LLMs, and explores various optimized prompts to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. By incorporating an external vector database, the framework outperforms a conventional LLM in generating accurate responses and constructing robust arguments. Additionally, the study delves into the investigation of optimized prompt templates for the purpose of efficient extraction of scientific literature. Furthermore, we present a targeted scaling study to quantify the algorithmic performance of the framework as the number of prompt tokens increases. The research addresses concerns related to hallucinations and false research articles by introducing a custom workflow developed with a detection algorithm to filter out inaccuracies. Despite identified areas for improvement, the framework consistently delivers accurate domain-specific responses with minimal human oversight.

In this systematic review, we review 69 existing experimental research studies on disability discrimination in hiring, published between June 1972 and January 2025, and outline key areas for future research in the field. Our review underlines significant differences in callback rates as well as variability in effect sizes across applicant and occupational characteristics. We also find that certain chronic health conditions and impairments have received more empirical attention than others. Exploring discrimination levels across a wider range of chronic conditions and impairments is necessary to move beyond monolithic understandings of disability as a binary ascriptive status and to discern different causal mechanisms associated with adverse employment outcomes among different subgroups. We argue that intersectional, theoretically grounded, and cross-national experimental approaches are needed to better understand and address disability discrimination in hiring.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) models struggle to reach performance levels due to the complex nature of Arabic grammar and diverse regional dialects. This study investigated how generative AI (GenAI) functions as a teaching assistant in Arabic language classrooms. Using qualitative methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 instructors; the data was then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results revealed that instructors used GenAI to create material, assess students’ work, and create personalized learning plans. Instructors struggled, however, with AI accuracy in dialect processing, cultural authenticity, and ensuring accurate assessment methods. The analysis raised significant gaps in teacher training, assessment strategies, and institutional guidelines. Instructors found it challenging to evaluate AI-generated Arabic content across different dialects and maintain academic integrity in student assignments. This study recommends developing instructor training, specifically on using GenAI tools for Arabic dialect variations and creating culturally appropriate Arabic language learning materials.}

This study used 30 semi-wild tomato GZ-05 plants as rootstocks and Ailsa Craig (AC) tomatoes as scions. After cold stress, the scion tolerance index, leaf ion permeability, and other physiological and biological indicators were used to determine the most tolerant plants. To understand the molecular basis of GZ-05 rootstock cold stress resistance, RNA sequencing and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques were used to compare the varying genes expressed in the grafted AC/GZ-05 and self-grafted AC/AC plant scion leaves. The results indicated that genes associated with melatonin (MT) and jasmonic acid (JA) production and their signalling pathways were considerably altered. The initial MT and JA levels in the GZ-05-grafted plant scions were high, and when they were exposed to cold stress, the amount of active MT and JA in AC/GZ-05 heterologous grafts were great. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9, we knocked out the MT synthesis gene (SlCOMT14) and JA synthesis gene (SlLoxD) and found that GZ-05 plant cold stress tolerance decreased. External tests were conducted to evaluate the GZ-05 SlCOMT14 and SlLoxD knockout lines. Source spraying with MT and methyl jasmonate showed that knockout strain cold stress tolerance could be recovered. SlICE1, a tomato cold stress tolerance transcription factor, was silenced, resulting in decreased tolerance to MT- and JA-induced cold stress. The MT/JA-inducer of C-repeat binding factor (CBF) expression 1-CBF pathway may be the mechanism by which the semi-wild tomato GZ-05 rootstock confers cold tolerance to plants. This study has uncovered the molecular mechanism by which grafting semi-wild tomato GZ-05 rootstocks increases plant cold tolerance, thereby laying the groundwork for the utilisation of Guizhou's native semi-wild tomato germplasm resources.}

Although, the sd1 gene provided early gains in LR, it has now become insufficient in modern cultivars with increased biomass and plant height. Deeper understanding of the intricate morphological and anatomical attributes, mathematical relationships and physical principles governing culm structural strength offer promise for enhancing LR. To unravel the genetic and structural basis of LR, we comprehensively phenotyped 353 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an inter-subspecific cross between Swarna (indica) and IRGC 39111 (tropical japonica), over multiple seasons for 12 culm strength (CS) and seven grain yield (GY) traits. Breaking resistance (BR) as a measure of internode breaking weight (IBW) and section modulus (SM) emerged as primary contributors to LR. Extensive phenotypic evaluations revealed wide variation and high heritability for most CS traits, as reflected in best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) estimates. Conversely, traits like tiller number exhibited low heritability as evidenced by the marked difference between their genotypic and phenotypic coefficients of variation indicating a strong environmental influence traits. Significant phenotypic correlations between CS and GY traits were observed. Histological analysis of the culm revealed that strong culm RILs possessed compact, thickened sclerenchymatous tissue and larger secondary vascular bundles compared to Swarna. NGS based GBS generated 63,367 SNP markers, and a high-density genetic map comprising 11,098 binned SNPs revealed 36 QTLs, including 15 major effect loci. Two consistent and major-effect QTLs—qCT7 (R2-14.49 %; 109 kb) and qIBW7 (R2-16.57 %; 33.83 kb) —on chromosome 7 were identified as key regions for LR. In-silico analysis of qCT7 revealed putative candidate genes including BRITTLE CULM1 like (OsBC1L 6, 7, 8), Cellulose synthase genes (OsCesA 3, 6, 8) and OsCSLF 1, 2, 9 involved in key processes underpinning cell wall thickening. The identification of qCT7 and its future cloning hold potential to enhance lodging resistance in rice, particularly under DSR conditions, contributing to the development of climate-resilient, high-yielding cultivars beyond the Green Revolution paradigm.}

At the same time, neural activity can also facilitate Aβ accumulation through intricate feed-forward interactions, complicating elucidating the conditions governing Aβ-dependent hyperactivity and its diagnostic utility. In this study, we use biophysical modeling to shed light on such conditions.

Daylight Saving Time (DST) has been a subject of debate concerning its impact on human health, particularly sleep patterns and daytime sleepiness. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing research on the effects of DST on sleep quality, duration, and sleepiness, identifying gaps, and setting a future research agenda.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, according to the PRISMA guidelines. The included studies were those that examined the impact of DST on sleep outcomes and daytime sleepiness in populations aged 6 to 85 years, using objective and subjective measures of sleep.
Results
The review analyzed 27 studies, revealing heterogeneous findings. The transition to DST was associated with adverse effects on sleep duration and quality, as well as increased sleepiness, more evident in evening chronotypes.
Conclusions
Although the transition to DST appears to negatively affect sleep patterns, particularly in spring and among evening chronotypes, definitive conclusions are hampered by methodological inconsistencies and external influences. This review highlights the need for future research employing standardized, objective measures across representative samples to elucidate the true impact of transitions to and from DST and the difference between ST and permanent DST on sleep and daytime functioning. Addressing these gaps is crucial for informed public health policies”.}

abstract = {The rapidly evolving labor market, driven by technological advancements and economic shifts, presents significant challenges for traditional job matching and consultation services. In response, we introduce an advanced support tool for career counselors and job seekers based on CareerBERT, a novel approach that leverages the power of unstructured textual data sources, such as resumes, to provide more accurate and comprehensive job recommendations. In contrast to previous approaches that primarily focus on job recommendations based on a fixed set of concrete job advertisements, our approach involves the creation of a corpus that combines data from the European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO) taxonomy and EURopean Employment Services (EURES) job advertisements, ensuring an up-to-date and well-defined representation of general job titles in the labor market. Our two-step evaluation approach, consisting of an application-grounded evaluation using EURES job advertisements and a human-grounded evaluation using real-world resumes and Human Resources (HR) expert feedback, provides a comprehensive assessment of CareerBERT’s performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that CareerBERT outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art embedding approaches while showing robust effectiveness in human expert evaluations. These results confirm the effectiveness of CareerBERT in supporting career consultants by generating relevant job recommendations based on resumes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of job consultations and expanding the perspectives of job seekers. This research contributes to the field of NLP and job recommendation systems, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners in the domain of career consulting and job matching.}

A laser beam with a Gaussian distribution was used to expose the solid thermal medium, thereby bringing a source of heat into the system. The study is grounded in the expanded theory of thermoelasticity without energy dissipation, which considers the interconnection between thermal, elastic, and magnetic phenomena. This theoretical framework serves as a basis for understanding the interactions and behaviors of thermal and mechanical processes within an elastic material. The system was analyzed using a direct approach, employing the Laplace transformation method to provide solutions for the system's equations. This methodology enables the computation and presentation of precise equations for several domains of concern, such as displacement, temperature, and thermal stresses. The discussion and analysis focused on a copper-based material, and graphical representations were used to demonstrate the behavior of the researched physical fields. These graphical representations aid in comprehending the development of displacement, temperature, and thermal stresses within the material caused by the laser beam and the interplay between thermal, magnetic, and elastic processes. The results demonstrate that the laser pulse parameters have a significant impact on the temperature and thermal stress distribution, thereby influencing the thermo-mechanical reactions of the solid medium. Ultimately, this study enhances our comprehension of the intricate behavior and interplay of thermal, magnetic, and elastic phenomena in thermoelastic materials.}

Online dating apps have become increasingly popular in recent years as a tool for finding partners. However, there is a gap in research on the comprehensive factors that influence users’ intentions to prefer online dating apps over traditional means, specifically in Indonesia. The present study thus proposes using web semantic techniques and integrates the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior to get a holistic perspective on predicting users’ intentions in online dating. The questionnaires analyzed using SEM-PLS indicate that the attitude toward online dating is positively affected by the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Additionally, attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy positively affect the intention to utilize online dating apps. The research thus introduces a consolidated technology to offer new insights and implications for the design and marketing of online dating apps by highlighting the importance of user-friendly interfaces, perceived benefits, social influence, and individual confidence in using the apps.}

The results reveal that recommendations by ChatGPT and the existing AI recommender similarly influence the consumer purchase journey from perceived performance (PP) toward intention to adopt a consideration set (IC) via trust in the recommender (TR) and trust in recommended products (TP). However, ChatGPT has a higher impact of PP on TR and a higher IC than the existing AI recommender. The higher the level of brand awareness, the higher the TP, but the gap is narrowed by the moderating effect significantly at low and medium levels but not at high level, which leads to IC. The study underscores the importance of marketers enhancing brand awareness despite the effectiveness of AI recommenders in influencing consumer choice. This empirical comparative study contributes to marketing literature by elucidating the interplay between ChatGPT, AI recommenders, consumer choice and brand awareness.}

Traditional empirical methods often fail to capture the complex interactions between flow, sediment, and pier geometry, leading to inaccurate scour depth predictions. This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach to improve scour depth prediction accuracy and interpretability. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from experimental studies reported in the literature, encompassing a range of pier configurations, sediment characteristics, and fluid properties under steady current conditions in both clear-water and live-bed environments. Advanced ML models, including ensemble techniques (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Random Forest (RF)), deep learning models (Neural Network (NN), 1D convolutional neural networks (1D CNN), Deep neural network (DNN)), and traditional methods (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Logistic regression (LR)), were implemented and evaluated. XGBoost demonstrated the highest predictive performance, outperforming both empirical methods and other ML models, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85 on the testing dataset between the predicted and observed results. Model interpretability was enhanced using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which highlighted the importance of features such as pier geometry, sediment properties, and fluid dynamics. Pile diameter (bp) and pile spacing in the perpendicular flow directions (Sn) were identified as the most influential parameters in determining normalized scour depth, followed by bottom pile cap elevation (h0), pile cap longitudinal extension from column (f1), and pile cap thickness (T), which also play significant roles. In contrast, pile spacing parallel to the flow direction (Sm), the number of pile lines parallel to the flow direction (n), and shape factor of CBP exhibited minimal influence. The proposed ML framework not only outperforms conventional methods but also provides interpretable predictions, offering a reliable tool to support scour risk assessment in bridge design and maintenance.}

However, studies have yet to highlight and isolate the consequences of changing demographic dynamics in different world regions on global patterns of biodiversity. To fill this research gap, we link a computational general equilibrium economic model (GTAP-AEZ) with biodiversity characterization factors representing potential species loss per unit area due to human land-uses in different world regions for mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and plants combined. This allows us to project the impact on species loss of a business-as-usual global economic scenario between 2021 and 2041, driven by changes in population, GDP, capital stock, labor force, and productivity growth. Second, we focus on demographic change as a sole driver of biodiversity loss and contrast the impacts of historical population growth (2001−2021) with those of future demographic trends (2021–2041) using the same biodiversity metric and economic model. Third, we analyze how the biodiversity projections are affected by the underlying uncertainty in 2041 population based on the United Nations Probabilistic Population Projections. Finally, we also identify those economic sectors and the three major market mechanisms driving the land-use change that explains biodiversity loss in each region. These are: domestic substitution of imports; direct increase in trade to satisfy the increased population abroad; and indirect increase in trade through third markets. The findings highlight how slowing population growth in the wealthiest countries will benefit biodiversity in some parts of the world, while continued strong population growth in Africa will lead to more rapid biodiversity loss in other regions. Our results provide insights into the global hotspots, drivers, and linkages that can be useful to diverse stakeholders (businesses, governments, and conservationists) for making progress towards the achievement of the global biodiversity targets and the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land).}

The findings indicate that reducing technological uncertainty enhances both online word-of-mouth (active peer effects) and government procurement (passive peer effects), both of which facilitate greater NEVs adoption. Additionally, moderation effect analyses suggest that social trust amplifies the negative impact of technological uncertainty on NEV consumption intensity, thereby indirectly validating the role of peer effects in fostering NEV adoption. Ultimately, this research underscores that, even without government fiscal subsidies, peer effects can serve as a vital self-reinforcing mechanism in adopting green technologies.}

Writing in the digital age has transformed from a mere communicative practice into a computational interface for multimodal creation—establishing a new paradigm where natural language functions as executable code for artificial intelligence systems. This research examines the pedagogical implications of this “Writing is Coding” framework, focusing on how learners navigate cross-media AI co-creation processes. Through a comprehensive three-round experiment, 102 undergraduate students engaged in progressive AI collaboration across textual, visual, and video modalities, using natural language as their primary creative instrument. Employing grounded theory methodology, the researchers analyzed data from student reflection journals, teacher observation logs, and semi-structured interviews to identify emergent patterns in AI-human creative partnerships. Five interconnected themes emerged: (1) prompt engineering as algorithmic thinking, (2) multimodal literacy development, (3) collaborative negotiation of creative agency, (4) emotional engagement through iterative refinement, and (5) metacognitive awareness of human-AI boundaries. Findings suggest that the “Writing is Coding” framework facilitates a deeper understanding of computational processes while enhancing creative expression. The three-round progression demonstrated increasing student comfort with AI collaboration, though tensions around authorship and creative identity persisted. This research contributes to emerging pedagogical approaches that position writing as a form of programming in AI-enhanced learning environments, with implications for curriculum design and digital literacy development.}

We aimed to identify keratinocyte cytoprotectants against sorafenib toxicity. The screening of cytoprotectants against sorafenib toxicity was performed using cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes or a reconstructed human epidermis model and off-patent approved drugs in the Prestwick Chemical library. Among 1273 drugs in the chemical library, 8 dose-dependently increased cell viability by >200% in the presence of sorafenib. In the presence of sorafenib, the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen–positive cells was significantly higher in clofazimine-, cyclosporin A–, and itraconazole-treated reconstructed human epidermis models than in sorafenib-treated models, and candidate drugs suppressed sorafenib-induced apoptosis in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. In addition, clofazimine, itraconazole, and pyrvinium pamoate significantly recovered the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 in the presence of sorafenib.

abstract = {Background
Metabolic reprogramming has recently been recognized as a critical driver in the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). While Songorine has been shown to modulate macrophage metabolism, its direct effects on chondrocyte metabolism and inflammation remain poorly understood.
Purpose
This study set out to explore how Songorine regulates glycolysis-driven inflammation in OA chondrocytes and to elucidate a novel mechanism linking metabolic reprogramming, histone lactylation, and inflammatory signaling.
Study Design
We utilized both in vivo OA rat models and in vitro IL-1β-induced chondrocyte inflammation models to assess Songorine's metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects.
Methods
Histological and biochemical analyses were performed on OA rat joints to evaluate cartilage degeneration, metabolic alterations, and inflammatory markers. RNA sequencing, ¹³C-glucose metabolic flux assays, and Seahorse extracellular flux analysis were used to characterize glycolytic activity. Histone lactylation levels were assessed by immunoblotting and CUT&Tag. The binding between Songorine and PFKFB3 was evaluated by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
Results
OA cartilage exhibited elevated glycolysis and inflammation, while Songorine treatment significantly restored metabolic homeostasis and alleviated inflammation. In IL-1β-stimulated chondrocytes, Songorine suppressed glycolytic flux, reduced lactate production and histone H4K12 lactylation. Lactate-induced H4K12 lactylation promoted the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and reinforced a PFKFB3-mediated positive feedback loop that sustained glycolysis and inflammation. SPR confirmed that Songorine directly binds to and inhibits PFKFB3, thereby disrupting this loop.
Conclusion
Songorine protects cartilage by directly targeting PFKFB3, thereby limiting glycolytic-driven lactate production, histone lactylation, and downstream inflammatory signaling. These findings uncover a novel glycolysis–lactylation–inflammation axis in OA and support Songorine as a promising metabolic modulator for OA therapy.}

Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., BERT, Bard, Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), LLaMA, etc., have the ability to take instructions, or prompts, from users and generate answers and solutions based on very large volumes of text-based training data. This paper assesses the impact and potential impact of ChatGPT on the field of digital forensics, specifically looking at its latest pre-trained LLM, GPT-4. A series of experiments are conducted to assess its capability across several digital forensic use cases including artefact understanding, evidence searching, code generation, anomaly detection, incident response, and education. Across these topics, its strengths and risks are outlined and a number of general conclusions are drawn. Overall this paper concludes that while there are some potential low-risk applications of ChatGPT within digital forensics, many are either unsuitable at present, since the evidence would need to be uploaded to the service, or they require sufficient knowledge of the topic being asked of the tool to identify incorrect assumptions, inaccuracies, and mistakes. However, to an appropriately knowledgeable user, it could act as a useful supporting tool in some circumstances.}

Nevertheless, various factors, such as diet, medications, circadian rhythm disturbances, gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and genetic predisposition, can disrupt the intestinal barrier. Such disruption may lead to bacterial translocation, subsequently triggering enterohepatic and systemic inflammation. Impaired intestinal barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, particularly chronic gut and liver diseases. In this review, we will summarize the fundamental functions of intestinal barrier and discuss clinical correlations between intestinal barrier dysfunction and diseases such as colitis, colorectal cancer, and chronic liver diseases including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

abstract = {The utilization of machine learning and data-driven approaches for mineral prospectivity modeling has become increasingly important in supporting regional mineral exploration. However, supervised learning methods have encountered several common challenges, such as overfitting and underfitting, in the process of mineral prospectivity modeling, particularly due to imbalanced sample sizes used for model training. This imbalance could limit the generalization capability of models and result in inadequate predictive performance of individual models. The present study introduced a novel hybrid ensemble model (HEM) that integrates various learner methods, including generative adversarial network (GAN) and transfer learning techniques, to effectively address the issues above. These intelligent prediction techniques were applied to analyze the geological, geochemical, and geophysical dataset in order to delineate potential areas for W-Sn mineralization in Malipo County, Yunnan Province, China. Meanwhile, some well-established supervised learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Boosting-based model (e.g., LightGBM), and Bagging-based models, which demonstrated exceptional performance in dealing with classification issues were also integrated into the HEM. The weights for integrating these models were determined automatically using the equidistant-sampling technique. The superior performance of the HEM in identifying known deposits made it an efficient tool for mineral prediction mapping. Additionally, this model also offered high flexibility and scalability by allowing adjustments to the types and quantities of base learners based on data characteristics.}

However, the conventional standard reconstruction methods under sparse view may lead to low-quality image in photoacoustic tomography. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sparse sinogram (projection domain) data reconstruction method based on mean-reverting diffusion model. By simulating the forward and reverse of the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) processes from high-quality images (full-view projection data) to degraded low-quality images (sparse-view projection data), this method enables the restoration of sparse-view projection data to full-view projection data without relying on any task-specific prior knowledge. Blood vessels simulation data, circular phantom data, the animal in vivo experimental data, and data acquired from an actual PAT system were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In the experimental tests on the “T”-shaped sample data acquired from the actual imaging system, even under extremely sparse projections (16 projections), the proposed method demonstrated significant improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to Cycle-GAN and U-Net, with increases of 16.46 dB (∼69.2 %) and 0.86 dB in the projection domain, respectively. This method enhances the sparse reconstruction capability of PAT in the sinogram domain, which is expected to reduce the costs and shorten the acquisition time of PAT in the practical applications, thus further expanding the application scope of PAT.}

abstract = {Background
The use of real-world data (RWD) warehouses for research in Asia is on the rise, but current trends remain largely unexplored. Given the varied economic and health care landscapes in different Asian countries, understanding these trends can offer valuable insights.
Objective
We sought to discern the contemporary landscape of linked RWD warehouses and explore their trends and patterns in 3 Asian countries with contrasting economies and health care systems: Taiwan, India, and Thailand.
Methods
Using a systematic scoping review methodology, we conducted an exhaustive literature search on PubMed with filters for the English language and the past 5 years. The search combined Medical Subject Heading terms and specific keywords. Studies were screened against strict eligibility criteria to identify eligible studies using RWD databases from more than one health care facility in at least 1 of the 3 target countries.
Results
Our search yielded 2277 studies, of which 833 (36.6%) met our criteria. Overall, single-country studies (SCS) dominated at 89.4% (n=745), with cross-country collaboration studies (CCCS) being at 10.6% (n=88). However, the country-wise breakdown showed that of all the SCS, 623 (83.6%) were from Taiwan, 81 (10.9%) from India, and 41 (5.5%) from Thailand. Among the total studies conducted in each country, India at 39.1% (n=133) and Thailand at 43.1% (n=72) had a significantly higher percentage of CCCS compared to Taiwan at 7.6% (n=51). Over a 5-year span from 2017 to 2022, India and Thailand experienced an annual increase in RWD studies by approximately 18.2% and 13.8%, respectively, while Taiwan’s contributions remained consistent. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) was predominant in Taiwan (n=410, or 65.8% of SCS) but less common in India (n=12, or 14.8% of SCS) and Thailand (n=11, or 26.8% of SCS). CER percentages in CCCS were similar across the 3 countries, ranging from 19.2% (n=10) to 29% (n=9). The type of RWD source also varied significantly across countries, with India demonstrating a high reliance on electronic medical records or electronic health records at 55.6% (n=45) of SCS and Taiwan showing an increasing trend in their use over the period. Registries were used in 26 (83.9%) CCCS and 31 (75.6%) SCS from Thailand but in <50% of SCS from Taiwan and India. Health insurance/administrative claims data were used in most of the SCS from Taiwan (n=458, 73.5%). There was a consistent predominant focus on cardiology/metabolic disorders in all studies, with a noticeable increase in oncology and infectious disease research from 2017 to 2022.
Conclusions
This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of RWD research in Taiwan, India, and Thailand. The observed differences and trends emphasize the unique economic, clinical, and research settings in each country, advocating for tailored strategies for leveraging RWD for future health care research and decision-making.

Beating behavior of induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from a symptomatic individual and an asymptomatic individual carrying a mutation for Brugada syndrome was analyzed with Ca2+ imaging method. Using machine learning methods, it is studied whether it is possible to classify the current peak data successfully and whether differences in the two mutant cell lines could be observed. We applied more machine learning methods than before. Baseline signals were first recorded and they were then exposed to adrenaline and these to an antiarrhythmic drug flecainide which should provoke the disease phenotype. Calcium transient signals derived from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were used for all computational analyses executed. Good classification results were generated with effective machine learning methods. Various test situations were applied to study how different parts of data can be separated to ensure their differences. Good results were gained that support the target so that it is possible to analyze whether the drug impacted on iPSC-CMs. It is also possible to separate which cells were affected by the drug and which were not affected. An important finding was that there were significant differences between calcium transient signals data originated from control subjects and patients and also between responses of the cells from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.}

Design of inquisitive bots which ask questions on a given topic of interest is one such application. To improve the quality of questions generated by such a bot while leveraging the power of transformer models, it is necessary to add a component to the pipeline that also considers the topic of discussion. This research examines transformer models pre-trained on natural language with the addition of topic context and subsequent optimization using genetic algorithms to generate more relevant questions. In our hybrid framework, we first use topic modeling for extracting context from the conversation history and then use these topics as input in the conversational training pipeline for generating questions on the given category. We attempt to fine-tune the framework to find the optimized weights using genetic algorithm. Our experiments are carried out using a large-scale dataset that is readily available to the public for the purpose of conversational question generation. We further evaluate the trained models on a dataset of Java passages performing qualitative analysis. Our analysis suggests that utilizing the genetic algorithm-optimized topic aware mechanism improves the quality of generated questions substantially in the conversational set-up.}

In this study, multiple one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) are developed for automatically extracting implicit damage-sensitive features from the structural raw dynamic responses to localize damage in the pile foundations of pedestrian bridges considering uncertainties such as environmental and operational variations (EOVs) inherent in dynamic responses. For this purpose, transient dynamics numerical computation models are established to simulate the multi-point dynamic response of the structure under different typical damage scenarios, forming the baseline dataset. Then, on-site vibration tests are conducted on the structural prototype. Ambient vibrations of the real intact bridge are considered EOVs and integrated into the baseline dataset, forming the test dataset. Additionally, the intact structural dynamic response with measured EOVs replaces the simulated intact structural dynamic response in the baseline dataset to form a reference dataset. The network architectures based on one-dimensional convolutional layers proposed in this paper are trained on the baseline dataset and reference datasets to obtain baseline and reference models. Subsequently, model performance evaluation is conducted on the test dataset, and the results indicate a significant decrease in the performance of damage models based on a single deep learning when EOVs are present. However, integrating the baseline and reference models achieves zero false negative/positive predictions which is safety-oriented and an exemplary classification accuracy of up to 97.2 %.}

However, entrepreneurs propose these projects within a context of information asymmetry and risk uncertainty which prospective backers must grapple with. Although Kickstarter has been requiring technology entrepreneurs to disclose project risk information since 2012, the value of this disclosure remains underexplored amidst controversies in the literature about whether project risk description enhances crowdfunding success. In addressing these issues, this research employs signaling theory and curvilinear analysis to examine what project risk description length and sentiment levels maximize crowdfunding success for technology projects, particularly those in developing countries. Statistical analyses of 1059 campaigns on Kickstarter partly support and challenge this study's theorizations. Risk description sentiment and length have U-shaped and inverted U-shaped effects on crowdfunding success respectively. Although these effects do not differ across projects in developed and developing countries, detailed risk descriptions generally yield better results for projects in developing countries. These insights advance and clarify the underdeveloped literature on the link between project risk description and crowdfunding outcomes and offer guidance on how developing country entrepreneurs can couch project risk statements to optimize crowdfunding success.}

We surveyed 2,026 Chinese undergraduates who had used GenAI in their studies. The findings indicated that the influence from others on using GenAI and hedonic motivation toward using GenAI were positively related to undergraduates’ appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge and negatively related to their view of it as a hindrance. Conversely, the anthropomorphic features of GenAI showed the opposite pattern. Undergraduates who viewed using GenAI as a challenge reported more positive emotions and demonstrated higher GenAI-powered learning productivity. Those who saw it as a hindrance experienced more negative emotions but showed no significant relationship with GenAI-powered learning productivity. Moreover, undergraduate students’ appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge or a hindrance and their emotional experiences played mediating roles in this influential process. Importantly, these relationships varied significantly across different student groups, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in GenAI integration.

This underlines Malaysia's commitment to combat climate change, mainly by reducing its economy-wide GDP carbon intensity by 45 % from the 2005 levels by 2030. To better understand the effects of renewable energy expansion on the economy, environment, electricity output and input-mix, a computable general equilibrium model is applied using an updated benchmark. The simulation results show that increasing the share of coal and gas in the power generation mix compromises emission reduction targets. Further, there is a trade-off between subsidized natural gas supplies and power generation and exports. The results also show that a larger proportion of renewable energy leads to improved welfare. As the share of gas and coal in renewable energy generation is not very high, its impact on carbon emissions is limited. However, if renewable energy expansion is complemented by subsidy rationalizations, the positive impacts are more pronounced. In terms of policy implications, the findings suggest that Malaysia must step up its emission reduction efforts by augmenting the generation of renewable rather than non-renewable resources. Complementary initiatives such as emission abatement policies and consumption subsidies for refined oil products and fossil-fuel power generation should be rationalized to expand renewable resources, improve energy security, and attain emission reductions.}

Despite a recent rise in adoption, telemedicine consultations retention remains challenging, and aspects around the associated experiences and outcomes remain unclear. The need to further investigate these aspects was a motivating factor for conducting this scoping review.
Objective
With a focus on synchronous telemedicine consultations between patients with nonmalignant chronic illnesses and health care professionals (HCPs), this scoping review aimed to gain insights into (1) the available evidence on telemedicine consultations to improve health outcomes for patients, (2) the associated behaviors and attitudes of patients and HCPs, and (3) how supplemental technology can assist in remote consultations.
Methods
PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guided the scoping review process. Inclusion criteria were (1) involving adults with nonmalignant, noncommunicable chronic conditions as the study population; (2) focusing on health outcomes and experiences of and attitudes toward synchronous telemedicine consultations between patients and HCPs; and (3) conducting empirical research. A search strategy was applied to PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL Complete, APA PsycNet, Web of Science, IEEE, and ACM Digital. Screening of articles and data extraction from included articles were performed in parallel and independently by 2 researchers, who corroborated their findings and resolved any conflicts.
Results
Overall, 4167 unique articles were identified from the databases searched. Following multilayer filtration, 19 (0.46%) studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for data extraction. They investigated 6 nonmalignant chronic conditions, namely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, and the telemedicine consultation modality varied in each case. Most observed positive health outcomes for patients with chronic conditions using telemedicine consultations. Patients generally favored the modality’s convenience, but concerns were highlighted around cost, practical logistics, and thoroughness of clinical examinations. The majority of HCPs were also in favor of the technology, but a minority experienced reduced job satisfaction. Supplemental technological assistance was identified in relation to technical considerations, improved remote workflow, and training in remote care use.
Conclusions
For patients with noncommunicable chronic conditions, telemedicine consultations are generally associated with positive health outcomes that are either directly or indirectly related to their ailment, but sustained improvements remain unclear. These modalities also indicate the potential to empower such patients to better manage their condition. HCPs and patients tend to be satisfied with remote care experience, and most are receptive to the modality as an option. Assistance from supplemental technologies mostly resides in addressing technical issues, and additional modules could be integrated to address challenges relevant to patients and HCPs. However, positive outcomes and attitudes toward the modality might not apply to all cases, indicating that telemedicine consultations are more appropriate as options rather than replacements of in-person visits.}

abstract = {Lung cancer (LC) is one of the main causes of illness and death. Inflammation is a facilitator of cancer growth and progression, affecting processes such as angiogenesis, antiapoptotic pathways, and DNA adduct formation. Cytokines are small proteins that can accelerate or slow tumor growth by controlling associated signaling processes such as cell proliferation, development, metastasis, and apoptosis. This review reveals the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and interleukins in LC. Macrophages play a role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pathogenesis and are associated with poor prognosis. A nested case–control study revealed that elevated concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 were strongly associated with the risk of LC. Specifically, the odds ratio for IL-6 and IL-8 in former smokers (fourth quartile vs. first quartile) were 2.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.55–4.70) and 2.83 (95% CI: 1.18–6.75). Because C-reactive protein levels are elevated in patients with NSCLC with larger and higher-grade tumors, CRP has been identified as a systemic indicator of chronic inflammation. Insulin-like growth factors influence cellular signal transduction pathways and contribute to tumorigenesis. Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors have been explored for their role in NSCLC prognosis, highlighting their association with chromogranin. Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7), urokinase plasminogen activator, matrix metalloproteinases, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 have been identified with a focus on their expression patterns and prognostic significance in LC tissues. Moreover, lung angiogenesis induces vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, myeloperoxidase, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase expressions. In conclusion, this review thoroughly summarized the inflammatory cytokines and specific factors influencing LC, providing the basis for further research on potential treatment approaches.}

abstract = {Objective
This article reviews the cellular and rheologic mechanisms of neovascularization (NV) and fibrinolysis in chronic ischemia. These mechanisms provide an explanation for the proteomic and cytometry data obtained from patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) who were successfully treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).
Rationale
G-CSF was used in CLTI to promote NV by progenitor cell mobilization. This review was prompted by the significant G-CSF-induced neutrophilia after each G-CSF administration. Neutrophils had been considered antiangiogenic and prothrombotic. However, angiographic evidence of arteriogenesis and fibrinolysis was observed in patients with CLTI treated with a novel G-CSF regimen (filgrastim 7-10 μg/kg every 72 hours for up to 10 doses). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays identified significant (P < .01) elevation of the concentration proangiogenic serum proteins and of plasmin (>10-fold) and fibrin degradation products (>5-fold) in plasma. Levels peaked one day after each G-CSF dose, as did the absolute neutrophil count. Levels decreased toward baseline before the next dose, in conjunction with the absolute neutrophil count. No hemorrhage occurred during the month of G-CSF treatment.
Methods
Multi-disciplinary literature review facilitated by artificial intelligence.
Results
Evidence has emerged regarding the context-dependent role of neutrophils in modulating both angiogenesis and fibrinolysis. The proangiogenic impact of activated neutrophils includes the release of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and angiopoietin 1. The increase in these same proteins 24 hours after G-CSF administration in the CLTI population treated above may thus be attributable to neutrophilia. Moreover, neutrophils secrete proteases that degrade thrombus and have context-dependent fibrinolytic capacity.
Conclusions
Induced neutrophilia can promote a proangiogenic and profibrinolytic environment in the specific context of chronically ischemic tissue. This article was prepared to facilitate further research into this potential transformative medical treatment for CLTI, with benefit potential in other chronically ischemic beds.}

abstract = {Despite rapid healthcare digitization, extracting information from unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), such as nursing notes, remains challenging due to inconsistencies and ambiguities in clinical documentation. Generative large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for automating information extraction (IE); however, their application in real-world clinical settings, such as residential aged care (RAC), is limited by critical gaps. Prior studies have often focused on structured EHR data and conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, overlooking critical aspects like robustness, fairness, bias, and contextual relevance, particularly in unstructured clinical narratives. To address these gaps, this study develops a holistic evaluation framework for clinical IE from free-text nursing notes in the Australian RAC. We systematically evaluate 17 LLMs, including general-purpose and healthcare-specific variants (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral, Gemini, T5) across retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and few-shot learning configurations (one-shot, three-shot, four-shot, five-shot). The evaluation focuses on two clinical IE tasks: named entity recognition (NER) and summarization. Results reveal LLaMA 3.1 achieved 88.58 % accuracy, 87.43 % F1 score in NER, 88.18 % F1 score, and 83.15 % relevance in summarization. However, robustness remained low (4.00 % for NER, 4.31 % for summarization) despite excellent fairness (99.9 %) and minimal bias (0.11 %) in both tasks. Further, healthcare-specific LLMs slightly outperform general models, and RAG-based approaches (LangChain, LlamaIndex) yield superior results. Task-specific optimal few-shot settings emerged: three-shot for NER and five-shot for summarization. This study provides a foundation for safely integrating generative AI into clinical decision support.}

abstract = {Durian (Durio zibethinus L.), an economically important fruit crop in Southeast Asia, is known for its strong sulfuryl aroma resulting from the accumulation of sulfur-containing compounds. However, our understanding of sulfur metabolism in fruit remains limited. In this study, we focused on the functional characterization of durian methionine γ-lyase (DzMGL), the key enzyme in volatile sulfur compound (VSC) production. In addition, to gain a better insight into sulfur metabolism, we profiled metabolites related to this process using various methods and assessed the expression of relevant genes through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Our gene and metabolite analyses revealed that sulfur metabolism is activated during ripening. Interestingly, DzMGL exhibited a higher efficiency in using L-cysteine than Arabidopsis MGL. The differential levels of the produced VSCs explained the aroma intensity-related differences between the two commercial Thai cultivars ‘Chanee’ and ‘Monthong’. Furthermore, the cysteine availability-related differences between the two cultivars could contribute to this variation, with ‘Chanee’ containing higher cysteine levels than ‘Monthong’. Our findings indicated that γ-glutamylcysteine was the preferred form of sulfur storage in durian pulps, with a potential recycling process providing intermediates that flux methionine toward ethylene biosynthesis and VSC production. This study provides novel insights into sulfur metabolism in durian fruit.}

However, previous studies have shown that students tend to become overly reliant on AI during collaboration, leading to issues such as limited breakthrough innovations and homogenization of ideas in AI-dominated creative processes. Drawing on distributed cognition theory, which views AI as an extension of human cognition, this study explores how strengthening human agency can improve student-AI collaborative creative performance and support learners’ development. In Experiment 1 (N = 170), students collaborated with AI on a creative problem-solving task, during which they were asked to think independently before or after collaborating with AI. Subjective experiences such as agency and perceived cognitive improvement were measured by questionnaires. The results showed that pre-collaboration thinking improved prompts quality and perceived cognitive improvement but did not enhance final creative output, possibly due to the limited persistence of human agency. Furthermore, Experiment 2 (N = 176) employed a similar task and measurements, and required students to integrate their own ideas with AI-generated content. This led to sustained improvements in both human agency and prompts quality, ultimately enhancing the creativity of final outputs and perceived cognitive improvement. These findings extend the application of distributed cognition theory to AI-supported creativity, highlighting the critical role of human-led idea integration and offering a novel perspective for future research on computer-supported creativity cultivation.}

French Broad River Basin, southeastern United States
Study focus
We combined fluvial and dendro-based paleoflood hydrologic data with instrumented data to understand long-term changes in extreme flow events.
New hydrological insights for the region
Droughts and extreme floods are underrepresented in streamflow records because of short instrumentation records. This study is among the first to develop a centennial-scale record (1734–2024) of hydrologic extreme events in the southeastern U.S. Interannual and interdecadal variability of extreme floods and droughts was observed. This suggests that hydrologic volatility is a persistent pattern in basins where precipitation is heavily influenced by the Bermuda High (North Atlantic subtropical high) and El Niño Southern Oscillation. Landfalling hurricanes generated some of the largest floods in the record. A late spring flood in 1791 CE, however, surpassed the magnitude of all other floods (0.0025 annual exceedance probability), including the 2024 CE Hurricane Helene flood (0.02 annual exceedance probability). Flood frequency and magnitude has declined since the 1800s, however. In contrast, drought severity has increased in the last century. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest flood frequency analyses reliant on floods-of-record from the last century to represent flood extremes may be underestimating flood risks, and droughts and extreme floods both occur on annual and decadal timescales, setting the stage for frequent sequencing of hydrologic extremes in the southeastern U.S.}
