abstract = {Background
Empathy is a cornerstone of interpersonal and emotional health, yet its measurement often conflates self-oriented sympathetic responses with other-oriented empathy. To measure other-oriented empathy in its interpersonal manifestation, the Self-Effacing Empathy Scale (SEES) was examined for its validity and reliability among adolescents and their parents.
Method
Adolescents and their parents, resident in South Africa were recruited through social media. Hundred and twelve participants completed a composite questionnaire that comprised the SEES, Basic Empathy Scale (BES), Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Vigour Assessment Scale (VAS). A replicative data set comprising the same measures was collected eight weeks later from the same participants.
Results
Convergent validity of the SEES was found in it correlating strongly in the initial data set with the BES (r = 0.639) and moderately with the other-oriented items of the IRI (r = 0.528), and strongly in the replicative data set (r = 0.884; r = 0.771). Discriminant validity was found in its weak correlation with the VAS (r = 0.326) in the initial data set. Cronbach's alpha coefficients indicated good (0.697) and excellent (0.940) internal consistency. The SEES incurred a small standard error of measurement, whereby the total scores were differing at most between 2.34 and 2.49 from the true values over 72 theoretically possible scores. A three-factor model indicated structural reliability, accounting for 46.3 % and 64.8 % of the cumulative variance in the respective data sets.
Conclusions
The SEES provides a valid and reliable measure for investigating associations between health and self-effacing empathy, and effects of interventions on it.}

This paper introduces a generative algorithm to optimize the layout of garden space elements. It aims to improve the rationality, aesthetics and functionality of the layout scheme through automation and intelligence, so as to better adapt to different environments and user needs. First, a geometric model of the urban landscape space is constructed, and the functional areas, green spaces, water bodies and other elements of the garden are converted into design constraints and objective functions suitable for generative algorithm processing. Then, using genetic algorithm as an optimization tool, through the iterative evolution process of the population, the position, form and combination of spatial elements are gradually adjusted to achieve the predetermined design goals. Finally, the fitness function is introduced to evaluate the pros and cons of each generation of layout schemes, including the openness of the landscape view, the coherence of the functional areas and the aesthetic evaluation. Through multiple iterations, the algorithm gradually converges to the optimal solution and provides a garden layout scheme that meets specific needs. In the layout optimization under complex terrain, the space utilization rate is between 75.0% and 77.8%. The landscape view is distributed between 66.3% and 68.0%, which is relatively evenly distributed. The urban landscape garden space element layout optimization method based on the generative algorithm introduced in this paper not only improves the design efficiency and accuracy but also provides new ideas for urban garden planning.}

keywords = {natural language processing, depression, anxiety, systematic review, artificial intelligence, AI},
abstract = {Background
The introduction of natural language processing (NLP) technologies has significantly enhanced the potential of self-administered interventions for treating anxiety and depression by improving human-computer interactions. Although these advances, particularly in complex models such as generative artificial intelligence (AI), are highly promising, robust evidence validating the effectiveness of the interventions remains sparse.
Objective
The aim of this study was to determine whether self-administered interventions based on NLP models can reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to November 3, 2023. We included studies with participants of any age diagnosed with depression or anxiety through professional consultation or validated psychometric instruments. Interventions had to be self-administered and based on NLP models, with passive or active comparators. Outcomes measured included depressive and anxiety symptom scores. We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies but excluded narrative, systematic, and scoping reviews. Data extraction was performed independently by pairs of authors using a predefined form. Meta-analysis was conducted using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and random effects models to account for heterogeneity.
Results
In all, 21 articles were selected for review, of which 76% (16/21) were included in the meta-analysis for each outcome. Most of the studies (16/21, 76%) were recent (2020-2023), with interventions being mostly AI-based NLP models (11/21, 52%); most (19/21, 90%) delivered some form of therapy (primarily cognitive behavioral therapy: 16/19, 84%). The overall meta-analysis showed that self-administered interventions based on NLP models were significantly more effective in reducing both depressive (SMD 0.819, 95% CI 0.389-1.250; P<.001) and anxiety (SMD 0.272, 95% CI 0.116-0.428; P=.001) symptoms compared to various control conditions. Subgroup analysis indicated that AI-based NLP models were effective in reducing depressive symptoms (SMD 0.821, 95% CI 0.207-1.436; P<.001) compared to pooled control conditions. Rule-based NLP models showed effectiveness in reducing both depressive (SMD 0.854, 95% CI 0.172-1.537; P=.01) and anxiety (SMD 0.347, 95% CI 0.116-0.578; P=.003) symptoms. The meta-regression showed no significant association between participants’ mean age and treatment outcomes (all P>.05). Although the findings were positive, the overall certainty of evidence was very low, mainly due to a high risk of bias, heterogeneity, and potential publication bias.
Conclusions
Our findings support the effectiveness of self-administered NLP-based interventions in alleviating depressive and anxiety symptoms, highlighting their potential to increase accessibility to, and reduce costs in, mental health care. Although the results were encouraging, the certainty of evidence was low, underscoring the need for further high-quality randomized controlled trials and studies examining implementation and usability. These interventions could become valuable components of public health strategies to address mental health issues.

This study explores how color temperature serves as a heuristic-based nudge to alter individuals' dining behaviors at restaurants. The findings of three experimental studies consistently demonstrate that color temperature affects individuals' perceptions of food healthiness, food tastiness, and their food consumption intentions. A cool-colored food image enhances perceptions of food healthiness and aligns with healthy dining information to influence individuals' consumption intentions. Conversely, a warm-colored food image is more effective at promoting taste-oriented food consumption. These results expand our understanding of how color influences consumer dining behaviors and offer valuable insights for hospitality practitioners to promote healthy dining through color adjustments.}

By integrating learning behavior analysis and sentiment analysis, the Random Forest (RF) model is used to deeply mine students’ learning behavior data, such as analyzing learning time, resource access frequency, etc., to precisely understand students’ learning patterns. At the same time, with the help of sentiment analysis technology based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), students’ emotional states during the learning process are monitored in real-time, including positive, negative, neutral, and other emotions. The experimental results show that by dynamically adjusting the learning path and monitoring students’ emotional states, students’ average scores increase by 6.0%, and homework completion rate increases by 4.4%. This study not only improves the overall quality of education, but also provides educators with more scientific decision-making support tools.}

abstract = {Fake reviews corrode the trust between businesses and consumers and distort the online image of a service or a product. The problem of fake review contamination is only going to worsen with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), that allow even novice users to massively produce fake reviews that can easily be mistaken for real. In this paper, we study a particular type of fake review attack, the AI-paraphrased reviews generated with ChatGPT 4.0. For this, we use an efficient pattern detection algorithm to quantify the similarity between the paraphrased and original reviews. We use a dataset that consists of 400 reviews spanning 20 hotels around the globe and 6000 fake reviews through Open AI API. Our results show that as the word length pattern increases, the mean similarity ratio between original (human) and AI paraphrased texts converge to 0 % while it stays above 20 % between AI-paraphrased texts. This pattern is consistent for reviews of hotels with diverse geographic locations. In this way, we introduce the importance of text similarity detection as a feature that could be incorporated to the design of future fake review detection algorithms. This method can be generalized to other applications where AI paraphrased text detection is necessary.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to explore how generative AI enhances employee creativity and performance in international hotel marketing. It applies an integrated technology–organization–environment (TOE) and antecedents–behavior–consequences (ABC) framework to examine the role of technological competence, organizational support, government support and artificial intelligence (AI) strategy in fostering employee innovation and performance.
Design/methodology/approach
A mixed-method approach was adopted, combining survey data from 206 international hotel marketers with semi-structured interviews. The study uses partial least squares structural equation modeling to test relationships and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify configurations leading to high employee performance.
Findings
Technological competence, organizational support and government support significantly influence AI-driven innovative behavior. Innovative behavior, in turn, enhances employee creativity and performance, with creativity acting as a mediator. AI strategy amplifies the impact of organizational support on employee innovation. The fsQCA results reveal multiple pathways to achieving high employee performance, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of AI-enabled outcomes.
Practical implications
Hotels can enhance employee innovation and performance by investing in AI training and aligning AI strategies with organizational support. Policymakers should promote AI-friendly policies and partnerships to foster adoption. Organizations can further benefit from integrating generative AI tools with workflows to boost creativity and service quality, enhancing competitive advantage in the hospitality sector.
Originality/value
This study contributes by integrating the TOE and ABC frameworks to explore the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms underpinning AI-driven performance. It introduces AI strategy as a boundary condition and offers new insights into the nuanced ways AI influences creativity and productivity in hospitality management.}

If many fuel rods were broken during the reactor operation or in the case of a nuclear accident, an increase of radioactivity associated with an increase of iodides concentration in the primary coolant could endanger reactor operation. Therefore, we examined the applicability and efficiency of the ion exchange resin DuPont™ Amberlite™ IRN78 OH, which is already in use at Czech nuclear power plants, for the separation of iodides from solutions containing boric acid. We performed a set of experiments with various iodides and boric acid concentrations, with two different ion exchange resin loads, and at two different temperatures. Sorption isotherm experiments were used to evaluate the removal efficiency of the ion exchanger for iodides and for boric acid, as well as to fit the Langmuir isotherm. Kinetic experiments were used to study the kinetics of the adsorption on the ion exchanger, as well as to investigate the mechanism of iodides adsorption on the ion exchange resin - pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and intra-particle diffusion models were applied to the experimental data.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) requires long-term adherence to oral anticoagulation and self-care.
Methods
We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a smartphone-based relational agent and heart rhythm monitor with the primary outcome of anticoagulation adherence and secondary outcomes of quality of life (QOL) and health care utilization. The trial enrolled individuals with Atrial fibrillation (AF) taking anticoagulation. Intervention participants received a smartphone-based relational agent for disease education, adherence monitoring, and self-care, and a heart rate and rhythm monitor. Attention control participants received a smartphone health education application and the same heart monitor. Participants had baseline and 4-, 8-, and 12-month visits. The primary outcome was 12-month proportion of days covered (PDC) ascertained with pharmacy claims.
Results
From January, 2020 to April, 2022, the trial enrolled 243 participants (age 70.8 ± 9.8 years; 64.2% female; 30.5% Black race). The adjusted mean PDC at 12 months in the intervention arm was 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.84-0.93) and in the attention control 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.90) with no difference in odds of PDC ≥ 0.80 in intervention compared to the control (Odds Ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 0.66-2.38]). Self-reported nonadherence and QOL did not differ by study arm. The event rates for health care utilization were significantly less for intervention than attention control participants as measured by emergency room visits and hospitalizations (P < .001) and number of days hospitalized (P = .004).
Conclusion
The smartphone-based relational agent intervention did not achieve its primary endpoint of increased anticoagulation adherence but did yield decreased health care utilization.

abstract = {Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare but serious condition resulting from structural and functional cardiac impairment in the late stages of pregnancy or shortly after delivery. The patient, a 33-year-old healthy woman, presented with sudden onset of shortness of breath, fatigue and chest discomfort five days after an uncomplicated full-term vaginal delivery following an uneventful pregnancy. Diagnostic workup confirmed a PPCM. Following a multidisciplinary approach, the patient underwent a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program which included 24 supervised biweekly exercise training sessions, a home-exercise program and a once-weekly group psycho-behavioral intervention. After 12 weeks, the patient showed substantial improvements in functional capacity, cardiac function, and quality of life. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, timely intervention, and the central role of cardiac rehabilitation in the management of PPCM.
Resumen
La miocardiopatía periparto (MCPP) es una condición rara, pero grave, derivada del deterioro estructural y funcional en las últimas etapas del embarazo, o poco después del parto. La paciente, una mujer sana de 33 años, acudió con aparición súbita de dificultad respiratoria, fatiga y malestar torácico transcurridos cinco días de un parto vaginal a término sin complicaciones, tras un embarazo sin incidentes. Las pruebas diagnósticas confirmaron MCPP. Tras un enfoque multidisciplinar, la paciente fue sometida a un programa amplio de rehabilitación cardiaca que incluyó 24 sesiones de ejercicios de entrenamiento semanales supervisadas, un programa de ejercicios domiciliario y una intervención de grupo psico-conductual una vez por semana. Transcurridas doce semanas, la paciente mostró mejoras sustanciales en cuanto a capacidad funcional, función cardiaca y calidad de vida. Este caso destaca la importancia del diagnóstico temprano, la intervención oportuna y el papel central de la rehabilitación cardiaca en el manejo de la MCPP.}

abstract = {Background
Patients undergoing inpatient allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) often experience psychological consequences. care.coach AvatarTM is a tablet-based ‘human-in-the-loop’ virtual health assistant (VHA) that uses generative artificial intelligence (AI) to provide psychosocial support. It has improved loneliness, depression, anxiety, hospital delirium, and falls in older adults in the hospital (Bott, J Med Internet Res 2019).
Methods
We adapted the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT. The VHA engages patients with reminders for hydration, medications, food, or activity; HCT education modules; playing games; playing the news or music; having free-form conversations; going through therapeutic activities and exercises; and practicing mindfulness and guided meditation. Avatar protocols were updated based on feedback from a structured focus group (n=10) of nurse navigators, inpatient HCT nurses, and HCT physicians at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. 7 HCT-specific educational modules were created. A feasibility pilot was performed in 3 sequential cohorts of 6 patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT. In the first cohort, patients were given the VHAs without any recommendations for how long to use them. The second cohort was given a recommendation for 30 minutes per day, and the third cohort was offered a $20 gift card for completion of at least 4 modules. Responses were measured through patient surveys and engagement data analysis. Predefined retention rate for feasibility was 67%, a standard for introduction of a novel AI technology (Teresi, Med Care 2022). Dissatisfaction rate for the overall VHA experience was defined as responding “disagree” or “strongly disagree” with recommending the VHA to others.
Results
The study included 18 patients (Table). Retention rate from enrollment to discharge or three weeks (whichever came first) was 78% (95% CI: 52-94%). A post-pilot survey was completed by 16 patients (90%), revealing a dissatisfaction rate of 28%. Dissatisfaction rates decreased from 50% to 20% to 0% across the 3 cohorts. Frequency of completion of the post-pilot survey for the full study was 72% within 1 week of disenrollment, and 90% overall. Average completion rate was 52% for all seven HCT modules in the whole study population. Across cohorts, module completion rates changed from 5% to 88% to 62%, reflecting guidance to patients. VHA functions by most time of usage were music (35%), exercise (20%), and education (15%; Figure).
Conclusions
The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the care.coach AvatarTM VHA for inpatient HCT patients. Despite modest dissatisfaction and variability in completion rates, the VHA showed promise in providing HCT education, social, and emotional support for inpatient RIC HCT. Further research is needed, including the potential application for outpatient HCT.}

abstract = {Background
Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) are common complications after surgery and anaesthesia, particularly in older adults, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Therefore, major medical societies have developed recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PNDs. Our study evaluated the reliability of large language models, specifically ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, in generating recommendations for PND management and comparing them with published guidelines.
Methods
We conducted an online cross-sectional web-based analysis over 48 h in June 2024. Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated recommendations were produced in six different locations across five countries (Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey, Canada, and the East and West Coasts of the USA). The English prompt ‘a table of a bundle of care for perioperative neurocognitive disorders’ was entered into ChatGPT-4 and Gemini, generating tables evaluated by independent reviewers. The primary outcomes were the Total Disagreement Score (TDS) and Quality Assessment of Medical Artificial Intelligence (QAMAI), which compared AI-generated recommendations with published guidelines.
Results
The study generated 14 tables, with TDS and QAMAI scores showing similar results for ChatGPT-4 and Gemini (2 [1–3] vs 2 [2–3], P=0.636 and 4 [4–4] vs 4 [3–4], P=0.424, respectively). AI-generated recommendations aligned well with published guidelines, with the highest alignment observed in ChatGPT-4-generated recommendations. No complete agreement with guidelines was achieved, and lack of cited sources was a noted limitation.
Conclusions
Large language models can generate perioperative neurocognitive disorder recommendations that align closely with published guidelines. However, further validation and integration of clinician feedback are required before clinical application.}

abstract = {Background
Lifestyle interventions have been acknowledged as effective strategies for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the accessibility of conventional face-to-face interventions is often limited. Digital health intervention has been suggested as a potential solution to overcome the limitation. Despite this, there remains a significant gap in understanding the effectiveness of digital health for individuals with prediabetes, particularly in reducing T2DM incidence and reverting to normoglycemia.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of different intervention modes of digital health, face-to-face, and blended interventions, particularly the benefits of digital health intervention, in reducing T2DM incidence and facilitating the reversion to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes compared to the usual care.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search in 9 electronic databases, namely MEDLINE, Embase, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Clinical Answers, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment, and NHS Economic Evaluation Database through Ovid, from the inception to October 2024. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that studied the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in adults with prediabetes. The overall intervention effect was synthesized using a random-effects model. The I² statistic was used to assess heterogeneity across the RCTs. We performed a subgroup analysis to explore the effectiveness of digital health, face-to-face, and blended interventions compared with the control group, which received usual care.
Results
From an initial 7868 records retrieved from 9 databases, we identified 54 articles from 31 RCTs. Our analysis showed that face-to-face interventions demonstrated a significant 46% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (risk ratio [RR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.47-0.63; I²=43%; P<.001), and a 46% increase in the reversion to normoglycemia (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.91; I²=82%; P=.006), when compared with the control group. On the other hand, digital health interventions, compared with the control group, were associated with a 12% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.01; I²=0.6%; P=.06). Moreover, the blended interventions combining digital and face-to-face interventions suggested a 37% risk reduction in T2DM incidence (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81;I²<0.01%; P<.001) and an 87% increase in the reversion to normoglycemia (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.30-2.69; I²=23%; P=.001). However, no significant effect on the reversal of prediabetes to normoglycemia was observed from the digital health interventions.
Conclusions
Face-to-face interventions have consistently demonstrated promising effectiveness in both reductions in T2DM incidence and reversion to normoglycemia in adults with prediabetes. However, the effectiveness of digital health interventions in these areas has not been sufficiently proven. Given these results, further research is required to provide more definitive evidence of digital health and blended interventions in T2DM prevention in the future.

abstract = {In the era of proliferating artificial intelligence (AI) technology, generative AI is reshaping educational landscapes, prompting a critical examination of its influence on students' learning processes and their self-efficacy amid concerns over growing technological dependence. This study investigates the nuanced relationship between generative AI use and university students' self-efficacy and technological dependence, illuminating the underlying paradoxes and implications for inclusive education practices. Through a survey of 348 university students, with 200 valid responses analyzed, we uncover the direct and indirect impacts of generative AI usage frequency on AI dependence. Our findings reveal a paradoxical effect: enhanced AI usage significantly amplifies students' confidence and efficiency in learning, yet simultaneously intensifies their dependence on AI. This dual impact both supports and complicates the incorporation of AI technologies into educational settings, underscoring the need for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in teaching and learning. Our study underscores the critical importance of a nuanced understanding of AI's role in education. It highlights the necessity of crafting an educational landscape where technology augments learning processes without compromising independent learning capabilities. By navigating the complex interplay between technological advancement and educational inclusivity, our findings guide the development of AI-assisted learning environments that are not only effective but also equitable and accessible.}

abstract = {Wind turbines are an important element of renewable energy systems, but their manufacturing requires significant amounts of materials such as steel, copper, aluminum, rare earth metals, fiberglass, and concrete, with considerable environmental impacts. One approach to reduce the environmental impacts of wind turbines and their components is the application of circular economy strategies. This study focuses on high-strength connection bolts, specifically M36 threaded steel bolts with a length of 660 mm. A comparative life cycle assessment is conducted to analyze the environmental impacts of two scenarios: recycling all bolts at the end of the wind turbine’s life cycle, and reusing some bolts after inspection. The product system is modeled in openLCA, where the processes of the foreground system are linked to the Ecoinvent database in the background system. For life cycle impact assessment, the ReCiPe 2016 method is applied, focusing on climate impact. Results show that after five life cycles, reusing bolts reduces the climate impact by 48%, compared to a 42% reduction through recycling alone. Sensitivity analyses reveal that the potential for impact reduction through reuse is primarily driven by the achievable reuse rate, while factors such as production technology, electricity mix, and transportation distances play a smaller role.}

abstract = {Opioids are frequently prescribed for postsurgical and acute pain management for both adults and children. However, research has shown that overprescription and improper handling of these medications contribute to problematic substance use, dependency, and overdose among the pediatric population. Despite increased awareness and efforts to mitigate the opioid epidemic, challenges persist, including inconsistent prescribing practices, inadequate education on safe disposal practices, gaps in prescription monitoring systems, and barriers to naloxone availability. In this review, we will highlight actionable steps and strategies for advocacy and intervention to reduce the burden of the opioid crisis in children and adolescents. Key topics include the critical role of opioid stewardship when managing postoperative pain, the importance of family engagement and education on safe disposal methods, the ongoing challenges of safe prescribing and monitoring, and opportunities to extend substance use screening and treatment referral for injured adolescents. Additionally, we will highlight policy recommendations to promote equitable access and availability of harm reduction tools such as naloxone. These strategies, if implemented together, can significantly reduce the risks associated with pediatric opioid use and mitigate the impact of the opioid epidemic on children and adolescents.}

abstract = {Advances in different approaches to critical quantitative statistics have been extensively used across various fields, with a wealth of empirical research illustrating applications and results. In education and other disciplines interested in disrupting White supremacy embodied across much of today’s policy and procedures, there is an increasing call to incorporate a diverse range of critical approaches to research methods. This pivoting aims to challenge the marginalization of subaltern ways of knowing, which has resulted in a tradition of reliance on (post-)positivist frameworks that limit the scope of research inference and validity. Critical psychometrics has become central in shaping our understanding of measurement, its accuracy, and the rationale behind approaches to code self-reported demographic categories as stable, fixed, and accurate estimates of oppression. This paper provides two mixed-methods survey study examples where these assumptions unsettle the notion that self-report demographics measure comparative indices of identity. Implications of this critical quantitative psychometric appraisal challenges the taken-for-granted nature of self-reported demographics; that is, these essentialized identity categories should be used to accurately and precisely compare differences between disability, race, class, gender, socioeconomic status, and educational background. With the validity theory behind this assumption challenged, this work provides a starting point, a stake in the ground, to pursue diverse methods to validate self-reports.}

abstract = {Introduction
Sickle cell trait (SCT) is a hereditary condition that affects millions worldwide, predominantly in individuals of African, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern descent. While traditionally considered a benign carrier state, emerging evidence suggests a potential association between SCT and malignancies. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between SCT and the risk of multiple myeloma, renal cancer, leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and colorectal cancer.
Methods
This study utilized de-identified electronic health records from the TriNetX database, covering a 20-year period. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted to assess cancer incidence and survival outcomes among SCT and sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Statistical analyses included risk difference (RD), risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and hazard ratios (HR) to determine associations between SCT and cancer risk.
Results
SCT was not associated with an increased risk for most cancers. However, individuals with SCT had a significantly lower risk of leukemia compared to those with SCD (RR =0.464, OR = 0.463, p < 0.001), suggesting a potential protective effect. Conversely, a modest but statistically insignificant increase in renal cancer risk was observed in SCT individuals (RR = 1.201, OR = 1.202, p = 0.059). No significant associations were found between SCT and multiple myeloma, HCC, or colorectal cancer.
Discussion
These findings highlight a complex relationship between SCT and malignancy risk. The observed protective effect against leukemia suggests a potential hematopoietic or immune-mediated mechanism. Meanwhile, the slight increase in renal cancer risk may be linked to chronic kidney stress and hematuria. Further studies are needed to validate these associations and investigate underlying biological mechanisms.
Conclusion
SCT does not significantly increase cancer risk overall but may confer protection against leukemia while showing a potential, though inconclusive, link to renal cancer. These findings emphasize the need for continued surveillance and further epidemiological studies to refine cancer risk assessment in SCT populations.}

Only a few studies have explored how compassion is taught to nursing students. This study aimed to investigate the differences in compassionate flow among nursing students both before and after an educational intervention.
Materials and methods
This study employed a cluster randomised controlled trial design in medical schools in Taiwan. We enrolled first- and second-year nursing students. The intervention group underwent dance movement therapy, while the control group received yoga training. Compassionate flow was assessed using the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scale and the Fears of Compassion Scale.
Results
A total of 59 participants (31 in the experimental group and 28 in the control group) were included in the final statistical analysis, and an 82 % response rate was recorded. Statistically significant differences were observed in total scores on the Compassionate Engagement and Action Scales, along with compassion for self and compassion from other subscales between the experimental and control groups (p < .05). The η2 effect levels were 0.12, 0.12, and 0.09.
Conclusions
Educational training employing dance movement therapy demonstrated enhancements in self-compassion and compassion for others among first- and second-year nursing students.}
