abstract = {Salmon farming plays an important role in the Norwegian food industry, supplying a large portion of the world's salmon. Despite its economic importance, salmon farming faces unique biological challenges impacting the health and welfare of the fish. These factors limit the growth of salmon and the full economic potential of salmon farms, highlighting the need for advanced techniques in aquaculture to enhance productivity and sustainability. A key technical challenge is the unavailability of effective monitoring tools, leading to greater difficulties assessing the condition of salmon in water compared to the assessment of the animal stock on land-based farms. To improve the observability of salmon farms, we designed and created a computer-vision based approach for salmon breathing rate estimation (SaBRE), which allows the automatic monitoring of the respiration frequency of each individual salmon in a group of fish, seamlessly covering the entire workflow from video-stream input to the final data output (end-to-end). We thoroughly evaluated the capabilities of our method in two ways. Firstly, we performed a quantitative analysis of the constituent modules of SaBRE, revealing that all modules were highly accurate, including a salmon re-identification module that achieved an accuracy of 99.51 %. Secondly, we analyzed data from a salmon experiment with SaBRE, demonstrating that our algorithm provides high-quality respiration frequency information that can be compared with other types of experimental data to infer biological relationships. For the fish in our experiment, we observed that the ranking of the respiration frequencies in individual salmon remains relatively unchanged both in the short term and over longer periods (i.e., a salmon with a high breathing rate consistently remains among those with the highest rates, regardless of changes in the environment). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation (Pearson correlation coefficients with r values between −0.61 and −0.90 and p values below 0.01) was observed between our algorithm's estimated respiration frequency and the dissolved oxygen (dO2) content in the water. In addition, the average breathing rate of the salmon was observed to increase in response to incidents potentially causing stress.}

abstract = {Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM) is a non-invasive hybrid biomedical imaging technology that combines the advantages of optics and acoustics to provide high-resolution biological tissue information at the submicron scale. Conventional PAM suffers from slow imaging speeds during high-resolution imaging due to the limitations of the laser pulse repetition rate. Although extending the sampling step size (i.e., sparse sampling) can enhance imaging speed and alleviate data collection demands, it might compromise image quality by causing distortions or the loss of fine details. This study presents an enhanced method based on the mean-reverting diffusion model for sparse-sampling high-resolution reconstruction in PAM to address the problem. The model captures prior knowledge of the data distribution by simulating the degradation process from a fully-sampled image to a sparsely-sampled image contaminated with Gaussian noise (mean state). The learned prior is then utilized to iteratively reconstruct a fully-sampled image from the sparsely-sampled one. The results indicate that the IR-SDE method achieves high-resolution sparse-sampling reconstruction for mouse in vivo blood vessel experimental data compared with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution method (RL Deconv) and CycleGAN method. Under super-sparse sampling (sampling ratios of about 0.4 %), the IR-SDE method reaches an SSIM of 0.742 and a PSNR of 24.22 dB using only about 0.4 % of the fully-sampled pixels, improving 0.597 (∼412 %) in SSIM and 11.51 dB (∼91 %) in PSNR, compared to U-Net method. Even in the case of reconstructing sparsely-sampled PAM images obtained from real-world scenarios without prior training or extensive trainable data, the proposed method still demonstrates satisfactory reconstruction performance. The proposed method is anticipated to improve reconstruction speed and imaging speed, achieving high-resolution reconstruction at super-sparse sampling.}

This shift has highlighted the importance of student AI literacy, which enables students to harness the power of AI tools and navigate the complexities of L2 writing more effectively and responsibly. Despite its significance, research on student AI literacy in L2 writing remains scarce, and there is a notable absence of instruments to measure, diagnose and track its development among L2 student writers. Heeding the call for developing psychometrically validated scales tailored to specific domains or disciplines, this study aims to develop and validate the L2 Writing-Student AI Literacy Scale (L2W-SAILS) for teachers and students to operationalise and assess student AI literacy in L2 writing. Building on relevant seminal works, this study proposed a four-dimension AI literacy framework, including ‘understanding’, ‘use’, ‘evaluation’, and ‘ethics’. Guided by this framework, a 22-item self-reported questionnaire on student AI literacy was developed and validated through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis involving respectively 435 and 350 Chinese university students. The results confirm that the L2W-SAILS is a reliable measurement scale for assessing student AI literacy in L2 writing, and the proposed four-dimension model is a robust representation of student AI literacy. The findings also contribute to a pedagogical framework that informs AI-assisted teaching and learning of L2 writing.}

abstract = {Since its first demonstration more than a half century ago, magnetic levitation (MagLev) has gained eminent scientific attention from both the fundamental and applied points of view. In essence, MagLev shows highly nonlinear dynamics, described with nonlinear differential equations. Thus, in order to exploit the MagLev phenomenon, both mathematical models and control algorithms must be constructed. Frequently authors use simplifications of the model, and in doing so, limit the application of the MagLev model around a nominal operating point. In these simplified cases, the MagLev models may contain parameters that are not represented by proper physical quantities. Thus, in this work, we revised the issue of MagLev modelling from the first-principle approach. More specifically, we theoretically derived expressions for the interaction between the magnetic fields of the solenoid and a small magnetic object. The behaviour of the inductance on a distance from the solenoid was then described. The suggested MagLev modelling concept was verified experimentally, confirming the validity and correctness of the proposed MagLev mathematical model. The results presented here could thus be regarded as highly beneficial for formulating more complex MagLev designs exploitable in the field of model predictive control of the position of a levitating object.}

First, we study the strength of collective dynamics during different market crises, and compare suitable portfolio diversification strategies with respect to the unique number of sectors and stocks for optimal systematic risk reduction. Next, we introduce a new linear operator method to quantify distributional distance between equity returns during various crises. Our method allows us to fairly compare underlying stock and sector performance during different time periods, normalising for those collective dynamics driven by the overall market. Finally, we introduce a new combinatorial portfolio optimisation framework driven by random sampling to investigate whether particular equities and equity sectors are more effective in maximising investor risk-adjusted returns during market crises.}

This case study examines an experiential exercise involving 118 postgraduate management students at a UK business school, where students were asked to write a 500-word reflection on their use of AI for a 2500-word essay-style assessment. Using sensemaking as a theoretical lens, we compare students' claims with assessors' evaluations of students' AI usage. Our findings indicate that students predominantly use generative AI for writing, paraphrasing, and rephrasing, rather than for fostering critical thinking or engaging in the more advanced stages of sensemaking, a level achieved by only one-tenth of the cohort. The consistency between this study's findings and pre-generative AI research suggests that higher education has yet to adapt adequately in ways to integrate AI to mitigate, rather than exacerbate, current sector deficiencies. We call on university leaders to develop institutional strategies that allow for effective and responsible integration of generative AI, and on educators to develop students' critical evaluation and academic writing skills that build on generative AI's affordances, with several specific recommendations made in this article.}

One hundred and five 10-week-old quail cocks were acclimated and divided into five treatment groups: negative control – G1, DEX-treated (20 mgL−1 of drinking water) – G2, DEX + VE (180 mg kg diet−1) – G3; DEX + Se (0.3 mg kg diet−1) – G4; and DEX + VE (180 mg kg diet−1) + Se (0.3 mg kg diet−1) – G5. The birds received their respective treatments over 21 days, and various performance, hematological, and semen quality parameters were measured. Results indicated that DEX treatment significantly reduced weight gain (WG) and feed intake (P < 0.05). Supplementation with VE and Se, individually and combined, ameliorated these effects, with groups G3, G4, and G5 showing similar WG to the control. Hematological analysis revealed significant increases (P < 0.05) in packed cell volume, hemoglobin, and white blood cell count in DEX-treated groups compared to G1. Treatment did not affect blood glucose and cholesterol levels (P ≥ 0.05). Plasma antioxidant assays showed elevated superoxide dismutase and catalase functions and reduced malondialdehyde levels in G3, G4, and G5 compared to G2, indicating reduced oxidative stress. No marked differences were seen in the plasma glutathione peroxidase activities across groups. Sperm motility was impaired in the DEX-only group but improved (P < 0.05) with antioxidant supplementation. In conclusion, dietary VE and Se effectively mitigated the negative impacts of DEX-induced stress on growth, antioxidant status, and spermatozoa motility in Japanese quail cocks. VE and Se supplementation could be beneficial in enhancing the welfare and productivity of poultry under stress.}

However, there is limited research on the impact of creative teaching on the classroom from a flow experience perspective. Using the stimulus–organism–response model and flow theory, this study presents an analysis of the overall process of creative teaching's impact on student classroom engagement, proceeding from two types of flow experiences: immediate and continuous experiences. This empirical study was conducted in the institutions piloting creative teaching in China. The results affirm the following: first, the balance of challenges and skills, goal clarity and feedback in creative teaching all affect students’ immediate and continuous experiences significantly and positively. Second, immediate experiences have significantly positive effects on both behavioural and social engagement. Third, for science and engineering students, continuous experiences have significant effects on behavioural engagement and social engagement; however, these effects do not obtain for humanities and social science students. Fourth, there is no significant difference in the effects of creative teaching on engagement between male and female students. The potential contribution of this study is that we create a theoretical model of how creative teaching affects student engagement. Based on this model, educational administrators and teachers can understand the whole process of the impact of creative teaching on students’ behaviour.}

However, generative AI models and AIGC have exacerbated several societal challenges such as security threats (e.g., misinformation), trust issues, ethical concerns, and intellectual property regulation, calling for effective detection methods and a better understanding of AI-generated vs. human-written content. In this paper, we focus on AI-generated texts produced by large language models (LLMs) and extend prior detection methods by proposing a novel framework that combines semantic information and linguistic features. Based on potential semantic and linguistic differences in AI vs. human writing, we design our Semantic-Linguistic-Detector (SemLinDetector) framework by integrating a transformer-based semantic encoder and a linguistic encoder with parallel linguistic representations. By comparing a series of benchmark models on datasets collected from various LLMs and human writers in multiple domains, our experiments show that the proposed detection framework outperforms other benchmarks in a consistent and robust manner. Moreover, our model interpretability analysis showcases our framework's potential to help understand the reasoning behind prediction outcomes and identify patterns of differences in AI-generated and human-written content. Our research adds to the growing space of GenAI by proposing an effective and responsible detection system to address the risks and challenges of GenAI, offering implications for researchers and practitioners to better understand and regulate AIGC.}

Circulating lipids and lipoproteins mediate cardiovascular risk, however routine plasma lipid biochemistry provides limited information on pro-atherogenic remnant particles.
OBJECTIVE
We analysed plasma lipoprotein subclasses including very low-density and intermediate-density lipoprotein (VLDL and IDL); and assessed their associations with health and cardiometabolic risk.
METHODS
From 1,976 community-dwelling adults aged 45–67 years, 114/1071 women (10.6%) and 153/905 men (16.9%) were categorised as very healthy. Fasting plasma lipoprotein profiles comprising 112 parameters were measured using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and associations with health status and cardiometabolic risk factors examined.
RESULTS
HDL cholesterol was higher, and IDL and VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides lower, in very healthy women compared to other women, and women compared to men. IDL and VLDL cholesterol and triglyceride were lower in very healthy men compared to other men. HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I were inversely, and IDL and VLDL cholesterol, apoB-100, and apoB-100/apoA-I ratio directly associated with body mass index (BMI) in women and men. In women, LDL, IDL and VLDL cholesterol increased with age. Women with diabetes and cardiovascular disease had higher cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and free cholesterol across IDL and VLDL fractions, with similar trends for men with diabetes.
CONCLUSION
Lipoprotein subclasses and density fractions, and their lipid and apolipoprotein constituents, are differentially distributed by sex, health status and BMI. Very healthy women and men are distinguished by favorable lipoprotein profiles, particularly lower concentrations of VLDL and IDL, providing reference intervals for comparison with general populations and adults with cardiometabolic risk factors.}

One is the ability to adsorb body odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the microclimate between the skin and the textile layer, and the other is the ability of the textile to kill and prevent the growth of odor-causing bacteria. However, most of the finishes use one of the two approaches, which lowers the efficacy of the finish. In this work, we have reported the use of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks, viz. ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs), which, when applied to polyester fabrics, serve a dual purpose of both adsorbing the odor and imparting antimicrobial activity. ZIF-8 NPs with an average size of ∼60 nm were synthesized by a water-based procedure at ambient temperature and applied in small concentrations on PET fabric using a commercial binder. The ZIF-8 functionalized polyester fabric (ZIF-8@PET Fabric) was characterized for its morphology and functionality. The fabrics were found to adsorb high concentrations of three odor-causing model compounds, such as isovaleric acid, indole, and nonenal, and could effectively inhibit the bacterial growth of E. coli and S. aureus. Further, the fabric functionality was retained even after several wash cycles and could be reused repeatedly.}

The investigation was conducted using an online questionnaire, which gathered responses from participants in the three countries. The survey consisted of questions that assessed participants’ experiences with AI tools, their views on AI-generated art in various forms, and their ethical concerns regarding its use. The results indicate that participants in China are generally more optimistic about the value of AI-generated art, prioritizing the quality of the final product over ethical concerns. In contrast, participants in the U.S. and Japan emphasize the importance of human creativity and express skepticism about AI art, primarily due to ethical concerns such as misinformation and intellectual property issues. While Chinese participants focus on data privacy and intellectual property protection, U.S. participants are more concerned with misinformation and fake content. Japan, despite having the least experience with AI tools, presents attitudes that often fall between the positions of the U.S. and China.

Herpetospermum pedunculosum (Ser.) C.B. Clarke (HP), a traditional Tibetan medicine used to treat hepatobiliary diseases, was confirmed that lignans-enriched ethyl acetate extract of HP (EAHP) could alleviate the hepatic injury by modern pharmacological evidence. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of EAHP against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are still unknown.
Aim of the study
To reveal the effects of EAHP on NAFLD and explore the potential mechanisms from the perspective of lipidomics and transcriptomics.
Materials and methods
UPLC‒Q–TOF‒MS analysis was carried out to investigate the chemical components of EAHP. A Choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined, high fat diet (CDAHFD) was used to establish a NAFLD mouse model. The anti-NAFLD effects of various dosages of EAHP were evaluated by biochemical indexes and histological analysis. Hepatic lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis and multiple bioinformatics methods were used to screen biomarkers and signaling pathways. The levels of the corresponding genes were verified by qPCR.
Results
36 kinds of compounds were identified by UPLC‒Q–TOF‒MS analysis. Oral treatment with EAHP significantly decrease the liver index and the levels of ALT and AST in the serum. The measurements lipid content and Oil Red O staining results suggested that EAHP ameliorated lipid metabolism disorders by reducing the content of TG and LDL-C, increasing HDL-C in the liver. H&E staining and ELISA revealed that EAHP restored hepatic inflammatory infiltration and decrease the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and increase IL-10 in the serum. Lipidomic analysis showed that EAHP could regulate CDAHFD-induced lipid metabolic disorder. The different lipid metabolites included TG, phosphatidyl choline (PC), diacylglycerol (DG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), ceramide (Cer). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Bmp8b, Nbl1, Rgma, Sphk1, Thbs1, and Ugt8a were important regulators, which were associated with TGF-β signaling pathway and sphingolipid metabolism. The expressions of above genes detected by were qPCR consistent with transcriptomic data.
Conclusions
The ameliorative effects of EAHP on NAFLD are potentially attributable to the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism and TGF-β signaling pathway, etc., which results in abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism and inflammatory response.}

abstract = {The mevalonate pathway is crucial in the metabolic reprogramming of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), driving lipid biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, and oncogenic signaling to sustain tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Its integration with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-driven signaling networks positions it as a cornerstone of PDAC biology and a compelling therapeutic target. The products of the pathway (sterols and isoprenoids) support key processes such as membrane biogenesis, protein prenylation, and immune evasion, facilitating tumor adaptation to the harsh microenvironment. Despite extensive research, therapeutic resistance and metabolic plasticity present considerable challenges in targeting this pathway. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the biochemical regulation of the mevalonate pathway in PDAC, its crosstalk with key oncogenic signaling networks, and emerging therapeutic strategies. In addition, we highlight critical knowledge gaps, including the complex regulatory crosstalk of the pathway with oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and nutrient-sensing pathways, and the mechanisms by which metabolic rewiring modulates tumor-immune interactions and therapy resistance. By integrating insights from pre-clinical and clinical studies, we highlighted promising novel combination therapies, including statins, bisphosphonates, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) inhibitors, as well as the potential for precision medicine approaches targeting mevalonate pathway vulnerabilities. Addressing these challenges may provide new avenues for improving therapeutic outcomes in PDAC.}

To ameliorate this situation, several computational methods were used to predict the structures of antibody:antigen complexes (Ab:Ag) and identify potential binders, in-silico. However, there is still a general lack of rapid virtual screening methods capable of screening large antibody libraries against a given antigen or group of antigens. In this work, we explore the application of a successful small-molecule drug discovery strategy and adapt pharmacophore-based virtual screening to the world of antibody discovery. Using a nonredundant data set of 874 Ab:Ag complexes, we have developed an automated method to create pharmacophores from the antibody complementarity determining regions. Our method is 98.6% (862 out of 874) successful at reproducing the ground truth, i.e., it can recapitulate the parental antibody:antigen complexes. In a benchmarking comparison with cognate docking, using 33 Ab:Ag complexes of therapeutic interest, the pharmacophore method was not only much faster than cognate docking but also recovered all the native interfacial contacts. In addition, it can also find additional putative antibody binders to a given antigen within clusters of Ab:Ag complexes with similar interfacial structures. Our method has significant implications toward accelerating biotherapeutic drug discovery as well as drug repurposing research. This method was implemented in MOE 2024 and is available to the scientific community.

The immense potential of AMs spans numerous industries and aspects of daily life, necessitating accelerated research efforts to meet the increasing demand. This article focuses on dielectric responsive elastomers, which are key materials within the field of AMs, highlighting advancements in theory, materials, and devices. To expedite the research and development of dielectric elastomer AM materials and beyond, we propose leveraging artificial intelligence tools to transform the artificial intelligence muscle research paradigm. Establishing an AM material database is highly valuable, as seemingly minor material data can be correlated with descriptors and target values via machine learning.

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of cardiac oncology, which combines elements of oncology and cardiology, trainees are required to possess in-depth comprehension of oncology/hematology principles and practice in addition to cardiovascular disease. Well-rounded cardio-oncologists (either oncologists or cardiologists) must understand cancer treatments' cardiovascular toxicities, cardiovascular risk assessment before, during, and after treatment, and cancer patients' unique cardiovascular disease management strategies. Advanced technologies including artificial intelligence and machine learning health tools have the potential to integrate patients' clinical data, including diagnoses, to create educational materials and tools to improve their understanding of their medical needs. Interactive educational platforms that are powered by technology, such as mobile applications, online forums and portals, virtual reality, and social media, can furnish patients with conveniently accessed videos, virtual simulations, and educational content pertaining to cardiovascular health and cancer.

The first step in the method is to construct a science-technology knowledge network based on papers and patents. Then a two-stage selection method funnels the scientific innovation signals, filtering out those with the potential to trigger technological breakthroughs. Next, a machine learning-based link prediction model, integrating three types of features, identifies new links between science-driven signals and existing technologies. A community detection algorithm then identifies sub-networks of technologies formed around these new links. Finally, a structural entropy index is used to evaluate these sub-networks to determine potential breakthrough technologies. By systematically characterizing the content and core features of scientific innovation signals, this study reveals the driving sources of technological breakthroughs and sheds light on the absorption and diffusion processes of scientific innovation. We validated the method through a use case in the field of artificial intelligence. Those who manage technological innovation should find the insights of this research particularly valuable.}

Using a comparative, interdisciplinary framework grounded in critical theory, developmental psychology, and human rights law, it explores how states manipulate curricula, emotional bonds, and youth institutions to reengineer identity, suppress dissent, and instill loyalty. Crises enable regimes to occupy moral and epistemic space left by collapsing institutions, reframing education as a tool of ideological purification. The study introduces the concept of affective captivity to capture the emotional restructuring of children's moral frameworks and links these practices to violations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It reframes indoctrination as a form of epistemic and structural violence with enduring psychological and civic consequences.

Energy has become a central issue in this situation. European nations have committed to reducing their dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Meanwhile, Russia has restricted gas supplies to some countries and substantially decreased deliveries to others, and Germany found itself in the driver’s seat. This study explores the role of AI-driven energy systems and environmental policy (EPS) in shaping Germany’s response to Russian gas dependency in shifting geopolitical landscape (GPR). Using a battery of robust econometric methods, the findings reveal that AI and EPS significantly reduce Germany’s dependency on Russian gas in both the short and long run, with stronger effects observed over the long term. Geopolitical risk, although having limited direct effects, but its interaction with AI and EPS highlights the compounded benefits of integrated technological advancement and policy strategies in mitigating energy dependency in times of turmoil. Moreover, the interaction between AI, EPS, and the 2014 Crimea crisis (D2014) demonstrated that this crisis acted as a catalyst, accelerating structural changes in Germany's energy policies and diversification efforts. To test robustness, this study uses the 2014 Crimea crisis as an exogenous shock. The Synthetic Control Method (SCM) reveals a significant gap between actual and synthetic Germany’s gas imports, highlighting Germany’s efforts to address energy dependency through AI-driven energy management and policy measures. Policymakers should integrate AI technologies with targeted energy policies to enhance energy resilience and reduce dependency on geopolitical adversaries during times of crisis.}

Existing studies frequently constrain raw data within narrowly defined parameter spaces to enhance their statistical significance. However, such an approach may inadvertently engender overly optimistic reliability evaluations, neglecting rare yet crucial failure scenarios. Consequently, this oversight potentially underestimates systemic risks and undermines robustness. To date, the dichotomy between high data acquisition rates and the intrinsic characteristics of collected data remains inadequately addressed. Concurrently, an urgent requirement persists for developing precise data distribution models capable of comprehensively assessing wind power system reliability. In response, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are employed to bridge this research gap, enabling predictions of wind power generation through analyses of data at varying granularities. Subsequently, an Improved Latin Hypercube Sampling (ILHS) methodology is implemented to partition sampling intervals, integrating seamlessly with the Monte Carlo (MC) method for wind power data sampling. This reliability assessment model fully exploits the flexibility of the proposed sampling technique, enhancing the precision of sample probability distributions, interval segmentation, and data stratification. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior predictive accuracy and enhanced statistical efficacy relative to conventional methodologies. Thus, it offers a robust and efficacious solution for assessing the reliability of wind power integration. This study evaluates the practical reliability of a local wind power integration system in Southwest China. Additionally, methods for discerning vulnerabilities are systematically applied to fortify critical power buses and augment overall system reliability.}

While concerns persist that experts' involvement may diminish subsequent supporters' performance due to a reduced likelihood of recognition, there is a plausible scenario in which it fosters learning and competition, thereby improving performance of subsequent supporters. Leveraging data from a Chinese online mental health platform, we utilize the mediation effects model to investigate the impact of healthcare experts' engagement on the performance of subsequent supporters. Within our model, we focus on the mediating effects of the effort and quality of answers from these subsequent supporters. Our research findings indicate that the engagement of counselors can directly enhance the social recognition obtained by subsequent supporters and can also indirectly boost this recognition by increasing the effort put into their answers. However, the quality of the subsequent supporters' answers does not play a significant mediating role in this relationship.

We used relative frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), a method to measure functional lateralization of affective processing, to investigate psychobiological correlates of SFDs. With alpha activity being inversely related to cortical network activity, relative FAA refers to alpha activity on the right frontal lobe minus alpha activity on the left frontal lobe. Less relative left frontal activity, reflected by negative FAA scores, is associated with lower positive and greater negative affectivity, such as observed in depression. Due to its negative affective component (illness anxiety), we expected to find less relative left frontal activity pattern in SFDs, and positive associations with self-reported chronic stress and depression symptoms. We recorded resting-state EEG activity with 64 electrodes, placed in a 10–10 system in 26 patients with a primary SFD, 23 patients with a major depressive disorder and 25 healthy control participants. The groups did not differ in FAA. Nevertheless, across all participants, less relative left frontal activity was associated with chronic stress and depression symptoms. We concluded that FAA may not serve as an indicator of SFDs. As the relationship of FAA and depressive symptoms was fully mediated by chronic stress, future studies have to clarify whether the association between FAA and chronic stress may represent a shared underlying factor for the manifestation of mental health complaints, such as depression.}

Moreover, we showed that DzMYB1 controls flavonoid biosynthesis by interacting with the promoters of various flavonoid biosynthetic genes, including chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavanone 3-hydroxylase, resulting in their transcriptional activation. Additionally, we found that DzMYB1 functions as a homodimer and binds to a homodimerized DzbHLH1 in the intricate regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the functional roles of MYB protein in the regulation of the flavonoid pathway within durian pulps.}

They provide virtual representations of medical devices and systems that facilitate real-time analysis and enhance decision-making. However, challenges such as secure data management, access control, and the lack of immersive and intelligent patient interactions limit their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a solution integrating blockchain technology, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Large Language Models (LLMs) within a metaverse environment to enhance MDT functionality. Blockchain and NFTs ensure secure ownership and access control, while the metaverse offers an engaging platform for user interaction. An LLM-powered non-player character (NPC) enables intelligent real-time user interactions and personalized insights. We develop two blockchain smart contracts for user registration, NFT ownership, and access control, and utilize decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage for the metaverse, MDT metadata, and interaction logs. We present the system architecture, sequence diagrams, and algorithms, along with the implementation and testing details. We conduct cost, security, and response time analyses to evaluate the smart contracts and LLM performance and compare our solution with existing approaches. We discuss practical implications, as well as challenges and limitations of the proposed solution. Finally, we explore the generalization of our system for various applications. The smart contract code and metaverse files are publicly available on GitHub.}

Five North Central dairy farms employing rotational grazing and diverse forage feeding were compared to a conventional total mixed ration (C-TMR) control. Milk and forage were analyzed for fatty acids by gas chromatography and for phytonutrients by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Soil indicators included total organic carbon (SOC), microbial mass, fungi-to-bacteria ratio, and organic-to-inorganic nitrogen ratio. Milk from regenerative farms contained higher omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n3) was 122–144% higher in farms 1 and 4, and docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5n3) was 800–1000% higher in farms 1, 3, and 4 versus the control. Forages averaged 217% more alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n3), whereas the control feed contained 148% more linoleic acid (C18:2n6). Regenerative milk was also enriched in phytonutrients including p-cresol sulfate (117%), hippuric acid (49.5%), and catechol (48.5%). Cluster analysis highlighted farm-level variation in compounds such as formononetin (20.6% higher) and genkwanin (225% higher). Soils from regenerative farm 1, with the most plant diversity, showed elevated SOC (up to 420 mg/kg) and a balanced nitrogen ratio (1.0).Overall, regenerative practices—including rotational grazing and diverse forage feeding—were associated with enhanced milk fatty acid and phytonutrient profiles, alongside improved soil health indicators. Further research is needed to assess long-term impacts across a broader range of farms.}

The unethical alienation of original knowledge producers from their intellectual products, which are repackaged by LLMs as artificial intelligence, conceals power asymmetries in the global knowledge production and dissemination system. As elaborated by Miranda Fricker (2010), Western White male actors traditionally dominate knowledge production; therefore, ChatGPT and other LLMs are inclined to reproduce patriarchal perspectives as universal understandings of the World. Our commentary applies this logic to accounting practice and research in Africa, and asserts that epistemic injustice, resulting from colonization and racism, means that ontological and epistemological approaches situated in the accounting needs and experiences of African communities are missing from or poorly articulated by ChatGPT and other LLMs. If LLMs are to attain legitimacy as (ethical) sources of knowledge, regulation must be enforced to ensure transparency—as a foundation for promoting pluriversality and eliminating epistemic injustice.}

However, manual assessments and human error can lead to delays and inconsistencies. This study employs situational awareness theory to develop an automated decision support system, integrating perception, comprehension, and projection components to enhance effectiveness. Specifically, an interpretable principal component analysis (iPCA) combined with machine learning is utilized to forecast CVSS scores using text descriptions from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Different forecasting approaches, including traditional machine learning models, Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and Transformer architectures (ChatGPT) are compared to determine the best performance. The results show that iPCA combined with support vector regression achieves a high performance (R2 = 98%) in predicting CVSS scores using CVE text descriptions. The results indicate that the variability, length, and details in the vulnerability description contribute to the performance of the transformer model. These findings are consistent across vulnerability descriptions from six companies between 2017 and 2019. The study's outcomes have the potential to enhance organizations' security posture, improving situational awareness and enabling better managerial decision-making in cybersecurity.}

abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has made significant advancements, particularly in the areas of large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs). KGs excel at structured knowledge representation and reasoning, offering interpretability; however, they are costly to construct, have limited coverage, and lack natural language processing capabilities. Conversely, LLMs possess powerful language understanding and generation abilities, but they rely heavily on vast amounts of data, are prone to “hallucinations," and lack interpretability. The integration of these two approaches is an inevitable trend for achieving stronger and more reliable AI applications, and has become a hot topic of research. Simultaneously, the combination of LLMs and KGs perfectly aligns with the pressing needs of the education field for precise reasoning and personalized services, addressing the shortcomings of traditional teaching methods and providing support for intelligent education. In light of this, this paper undertakes work in the following three key areas. Firstly, the concepts and technologies of both LLMs and KGs, along with their applications in education, are introduced. On this basis, the paper then delves into a discussion of the methods for integrating LLMs and KGs, and reviews related research progress. Finally, the paper focuses on specific educational scenarios, such as intelligent tutoring systems, intelligent learning companions, and intelligent evaluation systems, to explore the collaborative application of LLMs and KGs. The aim of this paper is to provide researchers in the field with a systematic understanding of LLMs and KGs, and to offer valuable references for future AI-driven educational innovation.}

abstract = {The human oral cavity harbors a diverse and dynamic microbial ecosystem, including bacteriophages (phages), which play a critical role in shaping the microbial community structure. Bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target and infect bacteria, have been increasingly recognized for their potential to influence both microbial balance and disease progression within the oral environment. Recent studies suggest that bacteriophages not only modulate the composition of the oral microbiome but also play an essential role in the pathogenesis and treatment of oral cancer. This review aims to explore the complex interplay between bacteriophages and oral health, with a particular focus on their emerging roles in oral carcinogenesis and therapeutic interventions. Oral cancer, a major global health concern, is often associated with microbial dysbiosis and chronic inflammation, both of which contribute to tumor progression. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a key bacterial species implicated in oral carcinogenesis, has been shown to promote tumor growth, enhance immune evasion, and exacerbate inflammation within the tumor microenvironment. Bacteriophages offer a promising strategy to selectively target and eliminate such pathogenic bacteria, thereby restoring microbial balance and reducing the pro-tumorigenic effects of bacterial infections. Through the disruption of biofilms and modulation of bacterial populations, phages may help mitigate the inflammatory responses that drive cancer progression. Additionally, phage therapy could complement existing treatments by sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Beyond their direct antibacterial effects, genetically engineered bacteriophages present novel opportunities for targeted cancer therapy. Advances in synthetic biology have enabled the development of phages capable of delivering therapeutic payloads, such as anti-cancer peptides, cytotoxic agents, and immune modulators. These engineered phages can be designed to selectively target bacterial species that influence tumor progression, offering a highly specific and precision-based approach to oncology. Moreover, phages can serve as vectors for cancer vaccines, facilitating antigen presentation and enhancing immune responses against tumor cells. In addition to therapeutic applications, bacteriophages hold promise in the field of cancer diagnostics. The ability of phages to selectively bind to specific bacterial biomarkers associated with oral cancer could be leveraged for early disease detection and non-invasive screening. Phage-based biosensors, for instance, have shown potential in identifying cancer-associated microbial signatures, paving the way for innovative diagnostic tools that could improve early intervention and patient outcomes. Despite their potential, several challenges must be addressed before phage-based strategies can be fully integrated into clinical practice. Phage resistance, immune system clearance, and regulatory barriers pose significant hurdles to the widespread adoption of phage therapy. Additionally, the complex interactions between bacteriophages, host immunity, and the tumor microenvironment require further investigation to optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety. Advancing research on bacteriophages in the context of oral cancer could revolutionize current treatment paradigms, providing more targeted, efficient, and patient-friendly alternatives to conventional therapies. By harnessing the natural specificity and adaptability of bacteriophages, clinicians and researchers can develop innovative approaches to combat oral cancer, ultimately improving patient care and clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {The impact of acupuncture on knee function and pain intensity following knee replacement remains controversial. Therefore, we categorized the postsurgery recovery period into 3 phases: short-term (≤2 weeks), intermediate-term (2 weeks–3 months), and long-term (>3 months), and then assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture in improving function and alleviating pain at different stages following knee replacement. This meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials that compared acupuncture intervention with either no treatment or a sham group after knee replacement. Six databases were searched from inception to December 31, 2023, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and 2 Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang Data). A total of 23 studies comprising 1,464 participants were included. Significant improvement of active range of motion was observed on day 7 and week 2 after operation. Lower pain intensity at rest was noted in patients receiving acupuncture in short-term periods after operation (12 hours, day 1, day 2, day 5, and week 2). A reduction in pain intensity during movement with acupuncture was observed on postoperative day 1 and day 7. Auricular acupuncture did not show not significant effectiveness in improving range of motion and pain intensity. For conventional acupuncture, the combination of distal and local point selection was found to be the most effective. Early application of acupuncture, in conjunction with physical therapy, starting before postoperative day 1 or day 2, was recommended. Further high-quality researches are warranted to validate the findings in this meta-analysis.
Perspective
This article demonstrates that acupuncture has short-term effects (≤2 weeks) on improving active range of motion and reducing pain during rest and during movement following knee replacement surgery. The findings support the early application of acupuncture in hospital settings after knee replacement.

In fact, new methods such as the large-scale corpus analysis of writing center session notes highlight the need for more critical analyses of the administrative software used to generate, archive, and distribute these texts. Drawing on Bogost's (2007) conception of procedural rhetoric and Manovich's (2013) understanding of softwarization, this article seeks to address this gap by recontextualizing writing center session notes within the layered arguments constructed by TutorTrac, a scheduling platform used by many centers. I argue this software advances a rhetoric of recordkeeping that, left unrecognized, risks shifting center practices away from stated commitments and values. In demonstrating how writing center practitioners can employ an understanding of procedural rhetoric to interrogate such applications, this study suggests more attention be dedicated to critical readings of software in writing centers.}

Two duplicated Star genes, namely star1 and star2, have been identified in non-mammalian vertebrates. To investigate the roles of star genes in fish steriodogenesis, we generated two mutation lines of star1−/− and star1−/−/star2−/− in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Previous studies revealed that deficiency of star2 gene caused delayed spermatogenesis, sperm apoptosis and sterility in male tilapia. Our present data revealed that mutation of star genes impaired male fertility. Disordered seminiferous lobules and spermatic duct obstruction were found in the testis of both types of mutants. Moreover, significant decline in semen volume, sperm abnormality and impaired fertility were also detected in star1−/− and star1−/−/star2−/− males. In star1−/− male fish, lipid accumulation, up-regulation of steroidogenic enzymes, and significant decline of androgens were found. Additionally, hyperplasic interrenal cells, elevated steroidogenic gene expression level and decline of serum glucocorticoids were detected in star1 mutants. Intriguingly, either 11-KT or cortisol supplementation successfully rescued the impaired fertility of the star1−/− mutants. Taken together, these results further indicate that Star1 might play critical roles in the production of both 11-KT and glucocorticoids, which are indispensable for the maintenance of male fertility in fish.}

An analysis was conducted of three international graduate students’ writing practices as they completed two argumentative writing assessment tasks. On one task, participants could access external writing resources (e.g., the internet) and had additional time to complete the task; on the other, access to writing resources was not permitted and a more restricted time limit was enforced. Data were collected from digital screen capture recordings of participants’ compositional practices and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results indicated that participants took more time and wrote at a slower pace when they had access to external resources; however, additional time did not necessarily lead to a greater volume of writing. Participants also tended to shuttle between writing processes more frequently and execute more micro-level writing actions when they had access to external resources. However, there was substantial individual variation for both fluency and writing processes, highlighting the mediating role of individual differences in L2 writing. Implications for how the construct of academic writing ability is defined in different assessment contexts are discussed.}

Educational relevance statement
Based on the data of 519 university students, this study used network analysis to comprehensively explore 25 variables (i.e., AI-related factors, cognitive and affective factors, individual characteristics) and to identify relatively central factors influencing students' acceptance and adoption (i.e., behavioral intention, objection to use, actual use) of chatbots-assisted learning in an integrated model. These results indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, and AI self-efficacy had close connections with students' behavioral intentions; privacy concern and AI learning anxiety were strongly associated with students' objection to use chatbots-based learning; social influence and facilitating conditions were highly linked with students' actual use behavior in the network model. Additionally, we found that satisfaction and intrinsic learning motivation played central roles in students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots for educational purposes. These findings offer important guidance for educators and developers to promote students' acceptance and adoption of chatbots in the learning process, thereby accelerating the widespread application of this novel technology within the educational domain.}

This research aimed to investigate the impact of a sourcing organizer on sixth graders' online multimodal and multiple document reading (MMDR) abilities, focusing on aspects such as source-content link and text integration in relation to reading on the Internet. Cognitive and affective factors associated with MMDR were examined. The study involved 52 sixth-graders (55.77% males) from two typical elementary school classes in the northern region of Taiwan. Two intact classes were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group with the quasi-experimental design. The experimental group (n = 26) received a pre-outlined sourcing organizer, guiding them to record the article title, author, publication date, website name, and major assertions from six assigned multimodal texts. In contrast, the control group (n = 26) received a regular organizer, prompting them to summarize the main ideas from the same six assigned multimodal texts. The study's findings indicated that employing sourcing organizers positively impacted students' performance in text integration. However, it was observed that both groups, regardless of whether they used regular organizers or sourcing organizers, experienced benefits in terms of source-content links. Furthermore, reading ability emerged as the sole significant predictor for source-content links, whereas both reading ability and the use of sourcing organizers predicted text integration. The implications of these findings were discussed to provide insights into instructional strategies to develop online MMDR competencies in elementary students.}

The present study aims to (i) develop a chronology of C. fissilis to the Southern Brazilian Plateau using traditional dendrochronological methods, (ii) validate the dendrochronological dating using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb pulse method, and (iii) determine the influence of temperature and precipitation variations and their teleconnections with the tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures on the annual radial growth of this species. The ring width chronology was developed using 24 C. fissilis trees. The Schulman years of 1957, 1962, 1963, 1966, 1969 and 1974 were independently dated using the 14C bomb pulse methodology by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Tree-ring indices were compared with temperature and precipitation records from stations around the study forest. The chronology covers the period 1907–2018 (111 years) and is well replicated (> 10 trees) from 1941 onwards. Statistics commonly used in dendrochronology indicate that the chronology is highly reliable and of good quality (mean series intercorrelation r = 0.49; Rbar = 0.30; EPS = 0.86; MSI = 0.40). The 14C bomb pulse of selected calendar years showed that the trees were accurately dated using the classical cross-dating approach. Precipitation from November to December (wet period) is positively correlated with tree growth (r = 0.36, n = 49; p<0.05). In addition, variations in temperature from May to July are positively correlated with ring width (r = 0.39, n = 49; p<0.05), suggesting that C. fissilis growth is favored by abundant rainfall during the growing season and above-average winter temperatures. Interannual variation in the chronology is partially modulated by El Niño 3.4 (East Central Tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperature) during Oct-Dec (r = 0.27, n = 68, p<0.05). The growth of C. fissilis trees is directly dependent on climate variability, suggesting that more abundant precipitation and higher winter temperatures, as projected for the future climate of southern Brazil, will have a positive effect on tree growth. However, prolonged droughts and high temperatures during the growing season will have a negative impact on tree growth, even in humid forests with high soil moisture content.}

abstract = {The reduction of the environmental impacts of the building sector, either through a decrease in its operational energy consumption or the promotion of circular practices, is the target of multiple EU policy initiatives. While different modelling approaches have been proposed to quantify the environmental impacts of the EU building stock, limited knowledge is available on the sensitivity of these models to key parameters associated with circular economy measures. To fill this gap, this study aims at testing lifespan and end-of-life modelling choices to gain an improved understanding of their effect on the quantification of the environmental impacts of the EU residential sector, using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based building stock model developed by the European Commission – Joint Research Centre (JRC) as the reference model. Several options were explored in relation to parameters affecting the service lives of buildings and their components, along with their end-of-life pathways. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to evaluate the model's robustness when subjected to parameter changes derived from the literature. It emerged that, due to the prominent role played by the operational energy phase, environmental impact results at the stock level were not significantly affected by parameter changes, with the exception of the particulate matter impact category, which achieved >10% variations when simultaneously testing shorter finishing material service lives and lower incineration and recycling rates. Shifting the focus to embodied impacts, however, led to increased sensitivity in the model, with oscillations due to service life length overshadowing those connected to end-of-life treatment changes: in terms of single weighted score, the former can achieve a building-level variation of over 100% (when assuming short lifespans), while the latter does not exceed 38% (when maximising incineration rates). It is therefore necessary to take these fluctuations into account when using this LCA-based model as a basis for verifying the potential benefits of measures to promote circularity within the building sector, particularly as said measures primarily target embodied impacts.}

However, it is unknown whether different levels of AI are perceived by customers as features increasing humanness and, subsequently, leading to higher functional, monetary, social, or emotional value. Through an experimental design based on tourism chatbots, the results from structural equation analysis reveal that whereas mechanical AI decreases automated social presence, analytical AI increases perceptions of competence and warmth, and emotional AI improves all humanness cues. The article merges the research streams of service agent design and customers’ perceptions of humanness to guide tourism managers in implementing generative AI agents to increase service value.}

However, the role of pracademics is conceptually underdeveloped and ambiguous, limiting our understanding of how actors engage in bridging the research-practice divide. We propose a continuum of research-practice roles, recognizing that hybrid roles are often fluid in nature. We explain how hybrid professionals hold different identities; as impact-driven scholars, reflective practitioners, or pracademics. These roles have implications for individuals' activities, identity work, career, and collaboration. Drawing on three contemporary challenges in HRM, we illustrate how hybrid professionals can align HRM theory and practice and help close the research-practice gap. As well as theoretical and managerial implications, we also highlight implications of the continuum of roles for policy makers and funders.}

The recent emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded for its transformative potential, yet there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding how this development influences WTC. To address this, our pioneering study investigates the impact of two major AI tools on EFL learners from China, one involving a chatbot and the other an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). 82 first-year undergraduates participated in the study and were assigned to two groups: the AI chatbot group and the ITS group. Pre- and post-session WTC questionnaires, reflection journals and a teacher interview were conducted to collect data. Results revealed significant disparities in WTC changes among the groups. Specifically, the chatbot group displayed significant improvements, while the WTC of the ITS group surprisingly declined. The study delves into the reasons behind these contrasting performances. It concludes by proposing practical implications based on the findings.}

As a first step to empirically test its model assumptions, we investigated potential associations between chronic stress, physiological stress axis activity and medically-unexplained in a cross-sectional study. One hundred-ninety-nine healthy individuals provided self-reports on chronic stress and medically-unexplained symptoms, resting heart rate/variability (HR/HRV; e.g., root mean square of successive differences/RMSSD, low frequency/LF power), cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal cortisol. Significant positive contributors to medically-unexplained symptoms were the chronic stress scales ‘lack of social appreciation’ and ‘chronic worries’, as well as CAR and LF HRV; diurnal cortisol was a negative contributor. Mediation analyses showed that the impact of neural indicators associated with physiological stress axis activity (HR/HRV) related to medically-unexplained symptoms, which was mediated by chronic stress, whereas the mediation effect as suggested by the positive feedback model was not significant. These cross-sectional findings do not support the positive feedback model. Longitudinal studies are required to conclude about potential mechanistic and causal relationships in the model. Nevertheless, our mediation analyses give first indication that the constitution of physiological stress axes may play a major role in how stressors are perceived and which kind of health-consequences (e.g., medically-unexplained symptoms) this may have.}

Safe and effective deployment of CCS requires reliable predictions of pressure buildup and CO2 plume migration under geological uncertainties. However, traditional numerical simulations are limited by computational inefficiency, while machine learning methods face bottlenecks in predictive accuracy and uncertainty. Here we introduce a generative emulation framework named DiffMF for efficient prediction of multiphase flows in geological CO2 storage. The framework treats flow prediction as conditional generation processes and employs cutting-edge diffusion models to produce the temporal–spatial evolution of pressure and CO2 saturation fields under varying geological property conditions. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on point estimation, the probabilistic nature of DiffMF allows for generating multiple predictions that align with the statistics of the underlying dynamics, thereby facilitating effective quantification of predictive uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse CO2 storage cases show that DiffMF achieves up to 52.6% lower CO2 saturation error compared to leading baseline models while maintaining high accuracy even under increased geological heterogeneity. Furthermore, we interpret the black-box model via visual analysis, providing insights into the generation process of DiffMF. Finally, the application to uncertainty quantification and propagation task for a field-scale storage system demonstrates that DiffMF yields statistics of the system responses in close agreement with those derived from high-fidelity simulations while executing 100 times faster, underscoring its promising potential in practical applications. The proposed generative emulation paradigm enables real-time prediction and probabilistic modeling that can foster informed decision-making for CCS deployment.}

Human and animal skin differ significantly, limiting the translational potential of animal-based investigations to advance therapeutics to human skin diseases. Hence, there is a critical need for physiologically relevant human skin models to explore novel treatment strategies. Recent advances in microfluidic technologies now allow design and generation of organ-on-chip devices that mimic critical features of tissue architecture. Skin-on-a-chip and microfluidic platforms hold promise as useful models for diverse dermatology applications. Compared with traditional in vitro models, microfluidic platforms offer improved control of fluid flow, which in turn allows precise manipulation of cell and molecular distribution. These properties enable the generation of multilayered in vitro models that mimic human skin structure while simultaneously offering superior control over nutrient and drug distribution. Researchers have used microfluidic platforms for a variety of applications in skin research, including epidermal–dermal cellular crosstalk, cell migration, mechanobiology, microbiome–immune response interactions, vascular biology, and wound healing. In this review, we comprehensively review state-of-the-art microfluidic models for skin research. We discuss the challenges and promise of current skin-on-a-chip technologies and provide a roadmap for future research in this active field.}

Participants responded to liking, emotions, and perceived sensory attributes of five blends of smoke-impacted wine with non-impacted wine, along with a smoke-impacted wine presented with four different label concepts. Two clusters of consumers were identified, with one disliking the smoke-impacted wine (smoke-dislikers) and the other cluster liking (smoke-liker). The smoke-liker cluster indicated a greater liking of smoke flavours in foods and beverages, along with a higher level of subjective wine knowledge. For the labels, the introduction of the label concept significantly increased liking of the wine for the smoke-dislikers, as well as had the power to elicit different emotions and sensory experiences. This research provides vital information to the wine industry as they adapt to future wildfire years, along with how the distinct sensory profile may not be detrimental to consumer acceptance and can be modulated by the type of information on label. Further research is needed to explore how different populations and wine styles correlate with these findings, and the effects of varying levels of smoke exposure in Pinot noir and other grape varietals.}

Using two experiments, this study found that an accusing nonprofit’s entity legitimacy and action legitimacy drive consumers’ blame attribution to the accused company. In addition, a strong CSR reputation helped defend the company against accusations from a highly legitimate nonprofit, but this effect was not observed when the nonprofit took highly legitimate action. The conclusions advise practitioners to meticulously examine the characteristics of the nonprofit involved in a nonprofit-led CSI incident.}

However, there is limited understanding of how mindset framing shapes users’ moral judgments and emotional responses toward these technologies. To address this gap, this research examines how framing GenAI, particularly in terms of growth or fixed mindset, influences moral appraisals, emotional reactions, and privacy behaviors. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research combines text mining of a large field dataset (n = 18,035 reviews) with two experimental studies (n = 255 participants). Findings reveal that mindset framing directly influences perceived morality, suggesting that GenAI framed in a growth mindset evokes more positive moral judgments compared to a fixed mindset framing. A growth mindset suggests learning and adaptability, whereas a fixed mindset framing implies that it is immutable and incapable of improvement. Perceived moral judgments mediate the effect of mindset framing (growth vs. fixed) on emotional appraisals. Moreover, mindset framing influences privacy behavior, with participants having low (vs. high) expertise disclosing more under a growth (vs. fixed) mindset. Theoretically, this paper contributes to the literature by integrating key theories on moral judgment, implicit theories, cognitive appraisal theory, and privacy calculus theory, thereby deepening the understanding of moral appraisals regarding GenAI. In practical terms, this research enables organizations to strategically frame GenAI capabilities, positively influencing users' privacy behavior and emotional responses.}

Despite their prevalence in both traditional and digital media, there is limited research on effective educational interventions that help students recognize and resist such deceptive visualization techniques. In this study, we developed a perceptual training intervention specifically designed to inoculate students against misleading visualizations. Unlike traditional perceptual trainings that typically involve only correct visuals, trainings for misleading visualizations require the inclusion of erroneous visual examples. While the informative feedback can help students to efficiently recognize such misleading visualizations and extract correct information, it may also disrupt the inductive learning during training, potentially reducing its overall effectiveness. To shed light into these possibilities, we investigated the role of informative feedback in a perceptual training designed for misleading visualizations. We conducted two experiments with large samples of undergraduate students (Experiment 1: N = 252, Experiment 2: N = 244). Experiment 1 tested the short-term effects of different informative feedback types during perceptual training, while Experiment 2 examined both the long-term retention (after one month) and near transfer to novel misleading visualizations. Results showed that informative feedback significantly improved students’ accuracy and efficiency in detecting misleading features within visualizations. Students also transferred these skills to novel misleading visualization types, and critically the benefits of informative feedback were sustained over a month. These results highlight the potential of perceptual trainings with informative feedback to inoculate students against misleading visualizations, offering valuable guidance for the development of educational interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of visual misinformation.}

abstract = {With the rapid expansion of e-commerce and the resulting surge in parcel delivery demands, the integration of trucks and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in last-mile package delivery provides a more efficient and sustainable venue for a logistics system. However, coordinating trucks and UGVs in the context of fluctuating traffic conditions, especially with varying travel times, continues to be a significant challenge. This study addresses this issue by proposing and solving a two-echelon truck-UGV routing problem with time-dependent travel times. The first echelon encompasses transporting goods from the warehouse to satellites using trucks, considering time-dependent travel times. The second echelon involves distributing goods from satellites to customers using UGVs. Initially, a continuous-time time-dependent travel model is proposed based on the fluid queueing model to estimate vehicle travel times under varying traffic conditions. We then develop a multiobjective mixed integer linear programming model that aims to minimize total operating costs and the number of UGVs used. Subsequently, a novel hybrid algorithm combining an improved three dimension k-nearest neighbor clustering algorithm with an improved multiobjective adaptive large neighborhood search method is developed to solve the model. This algorithm incorporates the adaptive score adjustment and Pareto solution selection strategies to enhance algorithm convergence and evaluate solution quality. The acceptance criterion for new solutions is redesigned based on multiobjective function values to explore the search space more thoroughly. Additionally, the algorithm’s computational performance is verified by comparing it with the CPLEX solver for small-scale problems and with multiobjective ant colony optimization, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, multiobjective particle swarm optimization, multiobjective monarch butterfly optimization, and multiobjective harmony search algorithms for medium-to-large problems. The results demonstrate the superior convergence, uniformity, and spread of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, a real-world case study employing traffic information of Dalian city, China, supports that the proposed method enhances the efficiency of delivery. Four different time-dependent travel times model are proposed to analyze the outperformance of the time-dependent travel model in this study. Finally, the sensitivity analysis considers different road congestion states and UGV capacities, aiming to reduce transportation costs, and overcome high coordination and congestion costs in the network. This study offers robust methodologies for theoretically and practically addressing the two-echelon truck-UGV routing problem with time-dependent travel times, providing essential insights for promoting development, enhancing smart city integration, and boosting operational efficiency.}

abstract = {The potential of Annona muricata leaf meal (SLM) as a feed additive for African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) was investigated through a 56-day feeding trial. The study began with a quantitative phytochemical analysis of SLM, followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) of methanolic leaf extracts. 180 juveniles, averaging 151.12 ± 8.54 g, were randomly assigned to four groups, each with 45 fish and three replicates in a Completely Randomized Design. The groups–Control, T1, T2, and T3 were fed diets containing 0 %, 2.5 %, 5 %, and 7.5 % SLM, respectively. Phytochemical analysis revealed substantial amounts of phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, and saponins. GC–MS identified 13 distinct compounds, including fatty acids, fatty acid esters, ethers and aldehydes. Fish were weighed at the study's conclusion, and blood samples were collected for hematological and serum lipid profile analysis. Condition factors and survivability were similar across all groups (p ≥ 0.05). However, final body weight (FW), weight gain, specific growth rate, total feed intake (TFI), and feed conversion ratio varied significantly (p < 0.05). The control group exhibited the highest FW (339.20 ± 3.16 g) and TFI (597.05 ± 6.65 g), with results comparable to T1. Conversely, TFI and growth progressively declined with increasing SLM levels, with T3 showing the lowest FW (299.62 ± 7.83 g) and TFI (541.06 ± 20.39 g). Hematological and serum profile indices were similar across groups (p ≥ 0.05). These findings highlight the nutritional and ethnopharmacological relevance of A. muricata leaves. It was, therefore, concluded that SLM can be included in catfish diets at 2.5 % without negatively affecting growth or health.}

Internal branding strategies attempts to improve employee's psychological and physiological wellbeing, yet the extensive integration of technology with work and workplace activities posit serious challenges in the form of technostress. In the context of communication, digital tools and mode of work increases efficiency, yet their impact of wellbeing and technostress experienced by employees needs to be examined. The present study aims to analyze the impact of internal branding on employee wellbeing and technostress under the influence of digital internal communication. The paper also examines if digital internal communication can moderate the impact of internal branding on employee wellbeing and also the impact of employee wellbeing on technostress experienced at workplace. The mediation effect of employee wellbeing between internal branding and technostress is also analyzed. The conceptual model was built on the premises of job demands-resources theory, technology acceptance model, and transactional theory of stress and coping. Data collected from 401 employees from information technology sector was analyzed using Smart PLS4. Results of structural and measurement model using PLS SEM indicate that internal branding improves wellbeing and reduces technostress under the influence of digital internal communication. Employee wellbeing is found to mediate the impact of internal branding as well as digital internal communication on technostress. Findings support the moderating effects of digital internal communication in reducing technostress and improving employee wellbeing. The hypothesised research model integrates three theories making a novel contribution by analysing wellbeing and technostress and exploring internal branding and internal communication in the digital context.}

This paper attempts to develop a novel analytical tool called ModularGraph to represent modular building layouts (MBLs) as graphs considering their unique adjacency, connectivity, and conjoint relationships in a triumvirate. It does so by developing a prototype then applying it to 36 modular buildings for iteration, finetuning, and finalizing. It is found that ModularGraph can effectively translate heterogeneous forms of MBLs into unified graph-based representations with rich graphic and semantic information. This study not only contributes an innovative graph analytic tool for design pattern mining, but also lays a stepping stone towards generative AI for modular building design.}

The proposed method first establishes a binary semantic segmentation dataset for energy dissipators and trains a salient object detection deep neural network to segment the energy dissipator binary map; Then, it uses morphological image processing and contour detection to calculate the residual capability automatically. U2-Net, U2-Netp, and BASENet were trained and compared by a dataset with 500 ring-type energy dissipator images. The proposed method was validated through a quasi-static tensile test and a full-scale impact test. Compared with the most accurate integration calculation method, the error of the proposed method does not exceed 3 %, and the efficiency is improved by about 25 times compared to the most commonly used manual detection method.}

keywords = {Medical image segmentation, Lightweight neural network, Attention mechanism, Multi-scale feature fusion},
abstract = {Background and objectives:
Current state-of-the-art medical image segmentation methods prioritize precision but often at the expense of increased computational demands and larger model sizes. Applying these large-scale models to the relatively limited scale of medical image datasets tends to induce redundant computation, complicating the process without the necessary benefits. These approaches increase complexity and pose challenges for integrating and deploying lightweight models on edge devices. For instance, recent transformer-based models have excelled in 2D and 3D medical image segmentation due to their extensive receptive fields and high parameter count. However, their effectiveness comes with the risk of overfitting when applied to small datasets. It often neglects the vital inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), essential for local feature representation.
Methods:
In this work, we propose PMFSNet, a novel medical imaging segmentation model that effectively balances global and local feature processing while avoiding the computational redundancy typical of larger models. PMFSNet streamlines the UNet-based hierarchical structure and simplifies the self-attention mechanism’s computational complexity, making it suitable for lightweight applications. It incorporates a plug-and-play PMFS block, a multi-scale feature enhancement module based on attention mechanisms, to capture long-term dependencies.
Results:
The extensive comprehensive results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in various segmentation tasks on different data scales even with fewer than a million parameters. Results reveal that our PMFSNet achieves IoU of 84.68%, 82.02%, 78.82%, and 76.48% on public datasets of 3D CBCT Tooth, ovarian tumors ultrasound (MMOTU), skin lesions dermoscopy (ISIC 2018), and gastrointestinal polyp (Kvasir SEG), and yields DSC of 78.29%, 77.45%, and 78.04% on three retinal vessel segmentation datasets, DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1, respectively.
Conclusion:
Our proposed model exhibits competitive performance across various datasets, accomplishing this with significantly fewer model parameters and inference time, demonstrating its value in model integration and deployment. It strikes an optimal compromise between efficiency and performance and can be a highly efficient solution for medical image analysis in resource-constrained clinical environments.

We design a two-stage instruction, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation to generate AIGC versions of events. Furthermore, a novel unsupervised joint learning strategy is proposed, which incorporates content consistency contrastive learning and difference consistency learning. The strategy aims to preserve both the consistency of event content and the heterogeneity between AIGC and HGC. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets, including Weibo and GossipCop, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a Consistent Match Accuracy (CM-Acc) of 77.21% on the Weibo dataset and 78.13% on the GossipCop dataset. Additionally, the model achieves AIGC detection accuracy rates of 90.58% on the Weibo dataset and 90.95% on the GossipCop dataset, thereby validating the effectiveness of both the model and the joint learning strategy.

The co-design process involved a series of workshops with clinicians followed by in-depth interviews with healthcare leaders to derive input regarding feasibility and implementation. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. There was a great deal of interest in compassion interventions from healthcare professionals and leaders. However, for compassion interventions to be acceptable, feasible, and effective, compassion interventions design should be reimagined and reflected at each step of interventional design and implementation and span across organizational levels. Namely, the results of the study showed the preference for non-individual focused multi-level interventions to build bridges and connections. The desired compassion intervention components included practising connecting with others' humanity, improving compassion knowledge and relational and reflective skills, and cultural safety and anti-racism training. Experiential training embedded in models of cultural dialogue was the preferred interventional modality. Prioritising leadership as an intervention site was suggested to improve leadership's buy-in of compassion interventions and possibly serve as a starting point for transforming the broader culture, reviving interconnectedness in a healthcare system described as fragmented, disconnected, and alienating with compassion also acting as an equalizer of power.}

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex, heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent relapses and metastasis. Previous studies have reported that the invasion and progression of CRC in several cases can be controlled by targeting fusion genes. This study aimed to screen for potent fusion transcripts as potential molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metastatic CRC (mCRC) using an in silico approach.
Methods
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 18 patients with primary CRC and matched normal and mCRC samples were derived from the same patient set. Novel fusion transcripts were screened using the Kallisto and Pizzly software, followed by Gene Ontology (GO), pathway analysis, transcription factor enrichment, and survival for functional enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the fusion transcripts’ utility as biomarkers was evaluated using a pan-cancer analysis.
Results
In total, 32 fusion genes unique to mCRC were identified. Hub gene analysis identified 17 novel fusion transcripts, and GO analysis revealed that these genes were enriched in different biological and molecular functions. Pathways significantly correlated with CRC included the complement and coagulation cascades, ferroptosis, interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway. We identified albumin-eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (ALB-EEF1A1) as unique to mCRC based on significant gene expression and survival outcomes. Moreover, its utility as a prognostic biomarker was confirmed using a pan-cancer analysis.
Conclusions
ALB-EEF1A1 may play a pivotal role in the metastatic transformation of primary CRC and significantly increase the risk of death. The identified ALB-EEF1A1 fusion transcripts are promising novel molecular targets that may serve as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets for mCRC in the future.}

The results showed that HSK21542 did not influence male and female fertility or early embryonic development in rats. HSK21542 also did not show significant manifestations of pre- and post-natal development toxicity in rats. In the embryo-fetal developmental study, even though there was a 3.5 % increase in incidence of fetuses with incomplete ossification of thoracic vertebral centrum in the 4 mg/kg/day group, the plasma exposure of HSK21542 in rats at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 82.3 times higher than that of human exposure at 1 μg/kg. On the other hand, exposure to HSK21542 during pregnancy in rabbits did not show any teratogenic risk, only causing a minor impact on bone ossification in fetuses. In conclusion, HSK21542 has a favorable safety profile with only minor effects on the embryo-fetal developmental outcomes.}

Individuals consistently rate content labeled as AI-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-AI collaboration performs significantly better than AI-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic (MH), individuals' preexisting beliefs about AI capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger MH beliefs attribute more effort to AI-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing MH as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-AI collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating AI while maintaining positive perceptions among users.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to examine the relationship between various types of literacy on one hand and identification of misinformation and dissemination of such information on the other, in search for better countermeasures against misinformation.
Design/methodology/approach
Based on data from a large-scale survey, models are constructed and analyzed to assess the relationships of literacy with both the identification of inaccuracies and dissemination behavior.
Findings
Regarding the identification of misinformation, individuals with high critical thinking attitudes (subjective literacy) are less likely to recognize misinformation, while other objective literacies do not have a significant relationship. Regarding dissemination behavior, individuals with high information literacy, media literacy and critical thinking scores tend not to disseminate misinformation, whereas those with high critical thinking attitudes are more likely to disseminate such information.
Originality/value
First, it quantitatively elucidates the relationships various literacies have with the accuracy judgment and dissemination behavior of misinformation. This highlights the effectiveness of objective indicators of literacies and the need for caution regarding subjective literacy – i.e. self-confidence in their own literacy. Second, it provides a cross-disciplinary analysis of the relationships, covering not only oft-studied politics and health care but also various other fields, thereby identifying comprehensive literacy strategies against misinformation. Third, it addresses differences in dissemination methods and offers insights into more practical countermeasures.}

Objective
While it is widely acknowledged that fingerprint recognition has played an essential part in policing and forensic science, little is known about fingerprint alterations in medical science, specifically as a consequence of anticancer treatments. Thus, we aimed to analyze the extent of evidence between cancer treatments and fingerprint alterations in adults with cancer.
Methods
A systematic integrative review was conducted according to the PRISMA statement and the Cochrane guidelines for conducting a systematic review. PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from the inception between August and November 2024. The quality appraisal was conducted to evaluate the methodological quality of the included articles, selecting the most appropriate tool based on the publication type and study design.
Results
Of 176 records, we selected five experimental studies articles and nine case reports publications. A correlation between specific anticancer treatments (capecitabine, taxanes, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and fingerprint alterations has been documented in individuals with various cancer diagnoses (mainly advanced breast and colorectal cancers). The majority of articles were of moderate to low quality.
Conclusions
Although fingerprint alteration as a consequence of specific anticancer treatments has been documented, further large and well-designed experimental studies are necessary to quantify the phenomenon burden in relation to specific anticancer regimens and populations.

In this study, we aim to investigate how neonatal exposure to sex hormones affects alcohol intake and the regulation of the mesolimbic pathway in adulthood. The study aimed to investigate the impact of neonatal exposure to a single dose of testosterone propionate (TP) or estradiol valerate (EV) on ethanol consumption in adult rats. The rats were subjected to a two-bottle free-choice paradigm, and the content of dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was measured using HPLC-ED. The expression of critical DA-related proteins in the mesolimbic pathway was evaluated through RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Supraphysiological neonatal exposure to EV or TP resulted in increased ethanol intake over four weeks in adulthood. In addition, the DA and DOPAC content was reduced and increased in the NAcc of EV and TP-treated rats, and β-endorphin content in the hypothalamus decreased in EV-treated rats. The VTA μ receptor and DA type 2 form short receptor (D2S) expression were significantly reduced in EV and TP male rats. Finally, in an extended 6-week protocol, the increase in ethanol consumption induced by EV was mitigated during the initial two hours post-naloxone injection. Neonatal exposure to sex hormones is a detrimental stimulus for the brain, which can facilitate the development of addictive behaviors, including alcohol use disorder.}

This duality reflects a broader shift toward physical AI a term used to describe embodied AI systems capable of interacting with the physical world through movement and perception - of which humanoid robots are a prominent example. Our paper explores how these technologies reshape and extend established management theories across three disciplines—human resource management (HRM), marketing and consumer behavior (CB), and operations management (OM). Specifically, we propose that in HRM, humanoid robots challenge team role theory by introducing machine-oriented roles, such as trainers and testers, while AI agents prompt a rethinking of social learning theory through their capacity to enable behavior simulation and dynamic feedback loops. In marketing and CB, AI agents reconfigure value co-creation within service-dominant logic by acting as autonomous co-creators of value, while humanoid robots influence social agency theory by altering perceptions of trust and power dynamics. In OM, these technologies drive new opportunities for throughput, agility, and process optimization by integrating real-time predictive analytics and adaptive workflow automation. These insights emphasize that while many traditional theories remain relevant, they require adaptation to account for human–machine collaboration, machine agency, and the hybrid roles emerging in organizational contexts.}

Past investigations found that activation in brain areas involved in executive function and reward processing was associated with people offering less with no threat of rejection from their partner, compared to offering more when there was a threat of rejection. However, it remains unclear how trait reward sensitivity may modulate activation and connectivity patterns in these situations. To address this gap, we used task-based fMRI to examine the relation between reward sensitivity and the neural correlates of bargaining choices. Participants (N = 54) completed the Sensitivity to Punishment (SP)/Sensitivity to Reward (SR) Questionnaire and the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System scales. Participants performed the Ultimatum and Dictator Games as proposers and exhibited strategic decisions by being fair when there was a threat of rejection, but being selfish when there was not a threat of rejection. We found that strategic decisions evoked activation in the Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) and the Anterior Insula (AI). Next, we found elevated IFG connectivity with the Temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during strategic decisions. Finally, we explored whether trait reward sensitivity modulated brain responses while making strategic decisions. We found that people who scored lower in reward sensitivity made less strategic choices when they exhibited higher AI-Angular Gyrus connectivity. Taken together, our results demonstrate how trait reward sensitivity modulates neural responses to strategic decisions, potentially underscoring the importance of this factor within social and decision neuroscience.}

In addition, do different types of EPUs impact exchange-rate risk spillovers consistently, and at which frequencies are they the most significant? To answer this puzzle, categorical EPUs, namely fiscal policy uncertainty (FPU), monetary policy uncertainty (MPU), trade policy uncertainty (TPU), and exchange rate and capital account policy uncertainty (ECPU), are introduced to explore the role that each type of EPU plays in the RMB exchange rate extreme risk spillovers. Moreover, our investigation is also conducted in multiple time-frequency domains through the implementation of the wavelet transform approach. The results indicate that the MPU exerts the most significant impact on total spillovers, while the TPU exhibits the weakest impact. For the net spillovers of each RMB exchange rate, the HKD/CNY and the AUD/CNY are more sensitive to EPUs, particularly in the long-term time horizon. These findings provide potential implications for policymakers in terms of market stabilization and for investors with foreign currency assets.}

Chemical analysis revealed that the average concentrations of heavy metals in both sediments and water increase from upstream to downstream. There is no clear significant relationship observed between changes in the values of investigated elements in sediments and water. The levels of these elements in the sediments, exceed toxic response thresholds. In the water samples, As, Ni and V concentrations exceed the WHO standard values. According to the Igeo, EF and PLI indices, the sediments at most stations are not contaminated by any of the elements. The CF and Dc indices suggest low contamination levels at all stations. The NIPI and ecological risk indices (Er and RI) indicate non-polluted conditions at all stations except SF22, SF20, SF11, and SF6. The MI and HEI indices indicate pollution in all water samples of the Sefid-rud, but critical values are only observed at SF5 and SF15. The other stations show no contamination. The Cf index indicates high pollution levels for all elements except Cu, Zn, and Pb. The upstream area poses a relatively high and considerable ecological risk according to the PERI index. In conclusion, the sediments of the Sefid-rud River have a higher potential for the exchange of toxic substances compared to the aquatic environment.}

Two hundred pre-service teachers assessed four randomly assigned texts from learners in grade six. Their assessment was compared to the existing ratings of two experts from a previous study. We found a relative judgment accuracy between r = .34 and .60 for the nine assessment criteria, with vocabulary being assessed significantly more accurately than almost all other criteria. Orthography, complexity and correctness of syntax and grammar and punctuation were rated with significantly more accuracy than cohesion, level of detail, communicative effect and coherence. The pre-service teachers assessed most criteria more strictly and with higher variability than the experts. The results suggest that teacher education should offer pre-service teachers concrete opportunities to practise writing assessment, implement activities to strengthen the assessment of content- and structure-related criteria, and help them adjust their assessment rigour.}

This issue is particularly severe for thermal reaction bonding material extrusion systems, where the motion and the deposition processes are coupled. To enhance the deposition accuracy, this work established a method to use real-time in-situ thermal images to capture and compensate for the geometrical accuracy of the printed parts and establish the spatial and temporal relationship between the inaccuracy and the deposition trajectory commands. The paper derives an analytical slender condition to process the printing regions with low curvature while establishing deposition direction allocation methods to account for the trajectory regions with high curvature. Real-time thermal image localization is performed with key printing feature detection and calibration. The localized and calibrated thermal images are aligned with the defined deposition direction to acquire the deposition inaccuracies. With the deposition dynamics considered, the deposition inaccuracy is reduced via dynamic deposition rate compensation. The proposed thermal imaging and compensation techniques have been experimentally verified with a material extrusion experimental platform to illustrate its capabilities to alleviate the deposition inaccuracy during the corner regions.}

These will range from networked Cyber-Physical Systems to edge computing devices, establishing real-time feedback control loops critical for managing Industry 5.0 deployments, digital agriculture systems, and essential infrastructures. The provision of extensive machine-type communications through 6G will render many of these innovative systems autonomous and unsupervised. While full automation will enhance industrial efficiency significantly, it concurrently introduces new cyber risks and vulnerabilities. In particular, unattended systems are highly susceptible to trust issues: malicious nodes and false information can be easily introduced into control loops. Additionally, Denial-of-Service attacks can be executed by inundating the network with valueless noise. Current anomaly detection schemes require the entire transformation of the control software to integrate new steps and can only mitigate anomalies that conform to predefined mathematical models. Solutions based on an exhaustive data collection to detect anomalies are precise but extremely slow. Standard models, with their limited understanding of mobile networks, can achieve precision rates no higher than 75%. Therefore, more general and transversal protection mechanisms are needed to detect malicious behaviors transparently. This paper introduces a probabilistic trust model and control algorithm designed to address this gap. The model determines the probability of any node to be trustworthy. Communication channels are pruned for those nodes whose probability is below a given threshold. The trust control algorithm comprises three primary phases, which feed the model with three different probabilities, which are weighted and combined. Initially, anomalous nodes are identified using Gaussian mixture models and clustering technologies. Next, traffic patterns are studied using digital Bessel functions and the functional scalar product. Finally, the information coherence and content are analyzed. The noise content and abnormal information sequences are detected using a Volterra filter and a bank of Finite Impulse Response filters. An experimental validation based on simulation tools and environments was carried out. Results show the proposed solution can successfully detect up to 92% of malicious data injection attacks.}

Their classification into proper species helps us to understand their biodiversity, allowing us to leverage their ecological and practical benefits. A new hybrid deep learning-based technique has been proposed, merging the Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer models with transfer learning frameworks like MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 for Fungi multiclass classification. This study utilized a publicly available dataset containing 9115 images of five fungal species from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. To address significant class imbalance, several data augmentation techniques were employed. The results showed that the Swin Transformer combined with DenseNet121 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 96.96 % for training, 95.97 % for validation, and 95.57 % for testing, while other models like ViT-DenseNet121 and Swin-MobileNetV2 also delivered competitive results. Using confusion matrices and benchmark classification metrics, and paired statistical testing, the analysis highlights the models' ability to generalize effectively and minimize misclassifications. To further ensure the robustness of the findings, a five-fold cross-validation was performed across all hybrid models. Additionally, explainable AI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM visualizations, were employed to interpret the model's focus areas, confirming attention to biologically significant structures. This research demonstrates a balance between modeling local features and capturing global context. Indeed, these hybrid models prove to be scalable and efficient for complex biological datasets. This interdisciplinary study bridges ecology and advanced technology by applying deep learning to enhance fungal classification. This study aims to improve the management and understanding of fungal biodiversity for the promotion of conservational and sustainable practices for the betterment of our ecosystem. The findings have significant applications, including sustainable agriculture through early detection of fungal plant pathogens, improved medical diagnostics for fungal infections, and biodiversity conservation through precise species monitoring.}

Teachers collaboratively learned, designed, and taught evaluation activities that were intended to foster these elements. We report on the program’s initial implementation with seven junior high school teachers and their students (N = 118), who were assigned to intervention and control groups. Using a mixed-method design, we administered assessments of information source evaluation to teachers and students before and after the intervention. Qualitative data sources included teacher interviews, teacher reflections, classroom observations, and PD meeting transcripts. Following the PD, teachers’ critical evaluation competencies became more elaborate and explicit. All of the teachers integrated information source evaluation in their instruction and adapted or designed evaluation activities that were tailored to their disciplines. Teachers faced challenges related to the complexities of integrating evaluation instruction in disciplinary topics, metacognitive instruction, and curriculum structure. Following the PD, students increasingly used source evaluation criteria, but there were no changes in their evaluation strategies. These results demonstrate the potential of the PD model and identify challenges that may inform future PD initiatives.}

abstract = {Recently, the concept of mobile labour has garnered increasing attention among mobilities scholars. Yet, the preponderance of research has emphasised workers’ movements that are fairly large-scale and routes-based. This paper proposes another kind of mobility that is of equal significance—that of micro-mobilities by labour, or more accurately by their bodies. Using original research conducted through semi-structured interviews with 40 customer service agents working in an international airport in Asia, the paper examines three kinds of aesthetic labour that these workers perform alongside passengers. Enacted through various bodily motions intended to speed up aeromobile processes and augment productivity, I argue that these performances produce a (tenuous) aesthetics of assuring presence, orderly movement, and passing time. As more and more work tasks are redistributed across the airport between staff and passengers, ‘new’ automation presents an opportunity to reflect on the mobile practices being invented as self-service technologies infiltrate customer service and other work where human relations and decision-making skills are required. More broadly, it also uncovers the gendered politics of bodily comport, gaits, gestures and other micro-movements in labour (re)production in a wider age of technological change.}

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become a revolutionary influence in drug discovery and design, altering conventional methods and presenting innovative, efficient, and economical answers to enduring difficulties in the pharmaceutical industry. Here, we explored the use of ML in the drug development process, offering a detailed overview of its classifications, methodologies, applications, and related problems. The classifications of ML namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning (DL) are examined comprehensively, emphasizing their distinct functions and capabilities across various phases of drug development. Techniques including support vector machines (SVM), Naïve bayes (NB), Bayesian networks (BN), random forests (RF), multilayer perceptrons (MLP), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) are evaluated for their effectiveness in identifying prospective drug candidates, forecasting pharmacokinetics (PK), and enhancing therapeutic profiles. Essential elements of effective ML deployment, encompassing comprehensive data collection methodologies, sophisticated data analytics, and access to huge databases like PubChem, ChEMBL, and DrugBank, are also discussed. The challenges associated with data quality, model interpretability, and computing resource constraints are examined, and various solutions, including transfer learning, data augmentation, and the establishment of collaborative frameworks, are proposed. Moreover, the chapter concludes by highlighting the necessity for improved data integration, the standardization of diverse datasets, and multidisciplinary collaboration among academia, industry, and artificial intelligence (AI) experts. By concentrating on these domains, the future of ML in drug discovery is set to unveil unparalleled prospects for the creation of safer, swifter, and more efficacious treatments. This chapter also provides an exhaustive overview for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders, elucidating the present status of ML in drug discovery and facilitating its future progress.}

abstract = {This study used high-frequency (HF) nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) sensor data to explore the uncertainty of calculating NO3-N loads in two headwater streams (Horndrup and Lyby-Grønning) with infrequent sample collection. Accurate annual and monthly N load estimates are crucial for cost-efficient management of N in catchments and for correct calibration and validation of catchment models like SWAT. Ultraviolet (UV) NO3-N sensors were installed in the two agricultural headwater streams for two hydrological years (June 2021 to May 2023) to measure NO3-N concentrations every minute. The cleaned dataset was used to investigate NO3-N load estimates using a Monte Carlo approach, with 1000 simulations for five infrequent sampling strategies: daily, weekly, fortnightly, 18 annual samples, and monthly samples. Bias (Flux Bias Statistic), precision (standard deviation), and total uncertainty (RMSE) were calculated for the annual and monthly NO3-N loads. Richards-Baker Flashiness Index (RBI) was used to explore the influence of hydrology on differences between HF and infrequent sampling. The sampling strategy needed to meet a bias and achieve RMSE <2 %, 5 %, and 10 % for monthly loads was explored. The uncertainty of the load estimates increased with fewer grab samples. The bias and RMSE of the annual load estimates from the five strategies were <±7.7 % and <10.3 %, respectively. Monthly NO3-N loads had higher uncertainties, with average bias and RMSE of ±4 % and 15 % (max. −13 % and 28 %) in Horndrup Stream and ±7 % and 27 % (max. 89 % and 194 %) in Lyby-Grønning Stream. In Horndrup Stream, a significant negative linear relationship between the bias of monthly NO3-N loads and RBI indicated higher underestimation with more storm events. In Lyby-Grønning Stream, precision decreased with higher RBI.}

To assess the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated detection of keratoconus (KC) in standalone Scheimpflug-based dynamic corneal deformation videos.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Participants
We retrospectively analyzed datasets with records of 734 nonconsecutive, refractive surgery candidates, and patients with unilateral or bilateral KC.
Methods
We first developed a video preprocessing pipeline to translate dynamic corneal deformation videos into 3-dimensional pseudoimage representations and then trained a CNN to directly identify KC from pseudoimages. We calculated the model's KC probability score cut-off and evaluated the performance by subjective and objective accuracy metrics using 2 independent datasets.
Main Outcome Measures
Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and KC probability score.
Results
The model accuracy on the test subset was 0.89 with AUC of 0.94. Based on the external validation dataset, the AUC and accuracy of the CNN model for detecting KC were 0.93 and 0.88, respectively.
Conclusions
Our deep learning-based approach was highly sensitive and specific in separating normal from keratoconic eyes using dynamic corneal deformation videos at levels that may prove useful in clinical practice.

abstract = {The structure-activity relationship has been a hot topic in the field of polysaccharide research. Six polysaccharides and three polysaccharide fragments were obtained from raspberry pulp. Based on their structural information and immune-enhancing activity data, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was used for prediction, and Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) algorithm was exploited for explanation structure-activity relationship of these raspberry polysaccharides in the present study. The structural information and immune activity data of raspberry polysaccharides were respectively used as input and output in the ANN model. The training and testing losses of ANN model was no longer decreased after trained for 200 epochs. The mean-square error (MSE) of training set and test set stabilized around 0.003 and 0.013, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of training set and test set were 0.21 % and 0.98 %, indicating the trained ANN model converged well and exhibited strong robustness. The interpretability analysis showed that molecular weight, content of arabinose, galactose or galacturonic acid, and glycosyl linkage patterns of →3)-Arap-(1→, Araf-(1→, →4)-Galp-(1 → were the main structural factors greatly affecting the immune-enhancing activity of raspberry polysaccharides. This work may provide a new perspective for the study of structure-activity relationship of polysaccharides.}

abstract = {To achieve efficient cooling of the multi-chip collaborative module with high heat flux, an annular nozzle dry ice particle jet fluid cooling method is proposed. The physical models of the multi-chip collaborative module, annular nozzle and heat sink are established. The multi-chip collaborative module consists of one logic chip with a heat flux of 295.86 W/cm2, and four High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) chips each with a heat flux of 52.08 W/cm2. Due to the difference in chip heat flux, pin fins are added to the internal copper base plate of the heat sink above the logic chip. In this paper, the method of numerical simulation is adopted, by changing the inclined angle of the annular nozzle outlet, the height of the heat sink, the size and distribution of the pin fins and other structural parameters, as well as the inlet fluid velocity of the nozzle and the proportion of dry ice and other thermal parameters, the cooling and heat transfer characteristics of the multi-chip collaborative module with a safety temperature of 378 K for the logic chip and 358 K for the HBM chip are simulated. The results show that the model with an annular nozzle outlet inclined at 60°, a heat sink height of ​​20 mm​​, and ​​a 6 × 6 arrangement of pin fins​​ with a diameter of ​​3 mm​​ and a height of ​​15 mm​​ ​​provides the optimal performance​​ for dry ice particle jet cooling. The greater the inlet velocity of the dry ice particle fluid and the higher the dry ice proportion at the inlet, the better the cooling effect of the chip. When the dry ice proportion at nozzle inlet is 0.3, as the nozzle inlet velocity increases from 1 to 4 m/s, maximum temperature at the logic chip undersurface decreases by 95.7 K. When the nozzle inlet fluid velocity is 3 m/s, as the dry ice proportion at the nozzle inlet increases from 0.1 to 0.2, maximum temperature at the logic chip undersurface decreases by 114.15 K. When the nozzle inlet velocity is 12 m/s and the dry ice proportion is 0.5, the heat flux of the annular nozzle dry ice particle jet fluid cooling multi-chip collaborative module is as high as 650 W/cm2 for the logic chip and 450 W/cm2 for the HBM chip. When the nozzle inlet velocity is 12 m/s and the dry ice proportion is 0.5, the total thermal resistance of the logic chip and the HBM chip decreases by 2.2 cm2·K/W and 10.57 cm2·K/W, respectively, compared to when the nozzle inlet velocity is 1 m/s and the dry ice proportion is 0.1. Based on the results of this paper, the quantitative relationship is fitted between the maximum temperature at the undersurface of the logic chip and the heat flux under different inlet fluid velocity and the proportion of dry ice. The research results provide targeted theoretical support and data references for the cooling scheme design, thermal performance regulation, and reliability improvement of multi-chip integration modules.}

We show that the results yielded by this automated approach are correlated with results given by humans and can be used to predict expected behavior in the field.

abstract = {This article argues for the importance of understanding language ontologies in applied linguistics. We draw on a range of related fields to further develop this framework, questioning the notion of a singular and homogeneous understanding of language. We not only move beyond a monolingual focus to embrace a more inclusive understanding of language(s) and their sociocultural underpinnings, but, drawing on the ‘ontological turn’ and its exploration of diverse worlds, we theorise language as a dynamic assemblage of elements that emerges uniquely in each performance or practice, grounded in specific contexts. Our contribution aims to expand the understanding of language as multifaceted and ever evolving phenomena, reflecting on a range of themes and questions, including how we might pluralise language within Western modernity. Is language the same across all contexts of contemporary western societies or within Western modernity? Does language apply only to human groups? How do nonhuman others perform language(s)/languaging? In challenging existing assumptions regarding what language is or what it might be, our research invites others to explore new possibilities in their examination of language(s), languaging, and semiotic practices.}
