Many studies have been done to shed insight into the existing state of mobile learning (M-learning) studies. However, further research is needed into this topic at a specific time, i.e., during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to retrieve, review, investigate, and critically assess the existing literature on M-learning that was conducted during the COVID-19 concerning our research theme. This study considered publications from four databases, narrowed our initial search results of 4056 articles down to 83 that are relevant to our research questions, and did an in-depth analysis based on the systematic review protocol. The findings explored the major focusing areas of M-learning applications, the regional sentiment of M-learning users, the determinants and perceptions of M-learning, as well as the benefits, challenges, and opportunities associated with M-learning. This systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to apportion a contribution toward an improved understanding of the basic principles that underpin the rethinking of M-learning applications for policymakers, online course designers, and blended learning facilitators.}

abstract = {The widespread use of AI-generated photos in marketing raises concerns about authenticity, trust, and misinformation. Addressing these challenges requires understanding the differences between AI-generated and human-captured (real) photos and developing effective detection methods. In this study, we compiled a database of AI and real coastal-related tourism photos to analyze their visual differences, and the detection accuracy of both human and deep learning models. While real photos display diverse color schemes and richer textures, AI photos exhibit enhanced brightness and simplified textures. Despite such significant differences in color and texture features, human judgment largely fails to distinguish AI from real photos, resulting in an average accuracy of only 67.7 %. To address this limitation, a hybrid deep learning model was developed, combining a CNN module for image processing and a dense module for integrating explicit visual features. While a single CNN module achieved an accuracy of 92.9 %, largely outperforming human judgment, the inclusion of explicit features further improves the model’s accuracy to 96.1 %, highlighting the importance of multimodal feature integration. The study contributes to understanding the implications of generative AI in marketing, underscores the importance of transparency for online content, and advances methodological approaches for detecting AI-generated visuals.}

abstract = {The damage to asphalt mixture caused by freeze-thaw cycles significantly affects its mechanical performance. This has been verified by the experiment. However, the damage evolution mechanism of asphalt mixture under the influence of repeated freeze-thaw cycles is still unclear. In light of this, this paper employs micro-scale numerical simulation and experimental methods to study the freeze-thaw damage mechanism of asphalt mixture. A beam specimen was utilized to measure the frost heave strain. The volume change of air voids caused by repeated freezing and thawing was described through the equivalent expansion coefficient, which was derived based on the content of air voids. A FE meso model of asphalt mixture was reconstructed using CT scanning technology and image processing technique. The internal damage evolution laws and mechanical properties of asphalt mixture were analyzed through FE simulation. Results indicate that with the increase in freeze-thaw cycles, the moisture absorption of asphalt mixture continuously increases, gradually stabilizing after 7 cycles. The frost heave strain increases rapidly in the early stage of freeze-thaw cycling, and gradually slows down in the later stage. The proposed equivalent expansive coefficient effectively characterizes the internal damage of asphalt mixture under repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Under the action of freeze-thaw cycles, the mortar around the void cracks first. As the cycles increase, adjacent voids gradually connect, and the damaged area of the mixture further expands. Both numerical results and the measured results indicate that the strength of asphalt mixture is more susceptible to freeze-thaw cycles than the modulus. The freeze-thaw cycles lead to a reduction in the fracture threshold of asphalt mixture. The proposed method based on equivalent expansive coefficient is reasonable and feasible, with certain applicability and universality to other porous materials.}

This is based on the reports about activation of endogenous PME in plant-based foods by high-pressure processing (HPP) treatment. Fresh orange (Hamlin) peel from a local commercial juice plant was pretreated with HPP at different combinations of pressures and durations, followed by pectin extraction with a commercial method. The effects of HPP pretreatments on pectin yield and structural properties of the extracted pectins were determined. HPP pretreatment increased the yield of subsequent pectin extraction by 41.10 %. Crude extracts from HPP-treated peels showed higher PME activities than the untreated peel. Pectins extracted from HPP pretreated peel (Hp) had a lower degree of methyl-esterification (DM), accompanied by an increase in degree of blockiness (DB) of non-esterified galacturonic acid (GalA) than the control (pectin extracted from un-treated peel). GalA content and linearity of pectin (LP) were higher, while neutral sugar content and degree of branching (DBr) were lower in Hp. The reduction in weight average molecular weight of Hp was minor, and it was positively correlated with a reduction in neutral sugars, indicating an effect of pectin debranching without degradation of the pectin main chain. The effects of HPP on the pectin main chain, degree, and distribution of methyl-esterification in this study were similar to the reported effects of orange PME on extracted pectin. The identified pectin structural features were validated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis and a newly developed lateral flow assay. The study indicates that HPP modification of pectin structure in fresh orange peel before pectin extraction may be an efficient and economical way to generate pectin with desirable structural features and to increase pectin yield.}

We analyze occupational exposure to LLM capabilities by incorporating human expertise and LLM classifications, following the methodology of Eloundou et al. (2023). The results indicate a positive correlation between occupational exposure and both wage levels and experience premiums at the occupation level. This suggests that higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater exposure risks from LLM-powered software. We then aggregate occupational exposure at the industry level to obtain industrial exposure scores. Both occupational and industrial exposure scores align with expert assessments. Our empirical analysis also demonstrates a distinct impact of LLMs, which deviates from the routinization hypothesis. We present a stylized theoretical framework to better understand this deviation from previous digital technologies. By incorporating entropy-based information theory into the task-based framework, we propose an AI learning theory that reveals a different pattern of LLM impacts compared to the routinization hypothesis.}

This study analyzed the impact of AI teaching on teaching quality, and revealed the mediating effect of student motivation and teacher expertise in the relationship of AI teaching and teaching quality.Based on the AI-TPACK theory, this study explored the impact of AI teaching on teaching quality and its mediating mechanism using questionnaires and AMOS structural equation modeling. The results show that AI teaching mainly improves teaching quality indirectly through enhancing student motivation and improving teacher expertise, rather than directly. This finding differs from the traditional view that AI teaching directly enhances teaching quality and emphasizes the important roles of students and teachers in AI teaching environments. The study provides some insights for educational policy makers and school administrators, pointing out that when implementing AI teaching strategies, emphasis should be placed on stimulating student learning motivation and teacher expertise growth in order to promote the optimization of teaching quality.}

abstract = {Unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings are quite popular worldwide due to their low construction costs, despite being susceptible to significant damage even from moderate earthquakes. In many cases, reconstruction may not be the most viable option due to financial and time constraints. Among the available retrofit solutions, steel-reinforced shotcrete (SRS) proves to be a cost-effective, straightforward, yet effective method for repair/retrofitting. This paper presents the results of an experimental study aimed at evaluating the effects of various construction conditions on the rebar pullout resistance of steel-reinforced shotcrete used as a retrofit method for URM walls. To achieve this, a total of 46 full-scale URM specimens were manufactured and tested, each consisting of a one-sided 50 mm-thick shotcrete layer with a single 8 mm steel rebar. The variables examined included the condition of the URM surface before the shotcrete application (wet/dry, with/without finishing including plaster/scratched plaster/oil paint), the condition of the rebar surface (rusty/clean), the type of rebar (plain/ribbed), rebar cover in the shotcrete layer (20/25/30 mm), and the URM substrate temperature before application of shotcrete (20 °C/-16 °C). The results indicate that there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens under the following conditions: when the wall's finishing is removed, the wall's surface is wetted before shotcrete application, ribbed steel rebar is utilized, and the temperature of URM before shotcrete application is 20 °C, there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens by 58 %, 56 %, 32 %, and 13 %, respectively. Additionally, when the steel rebar cover is sufficient, ribbed steel rebar is utilized, and this rebar is rusted, there is an increase in pullout resistance of the specimens by 55 %, 10 %, and 6 %, respectively.}

Aged type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are linked with lower serum levels of total antioxidant activity, magnesium and zinc, particularly under uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled oxidative stress is an established contributor to diabetic complications. Magnesium is a cofactor for ∼600 enzymes, while zinc is a part of ∼3000 human proteins, essential for intermediary metabolism. A multi-targeted approach combining β-carotene, Magnesium and Zinc (BMZ) with metformin or vitamin E, Magnesium and Zinc (EMZ) with metformin for daily use in aged rats with T2DM identified astonishing findings compared to metformin monotherapy. Over three months, compared to metformin monotherapy, BMZ with metformin provided excellent glycemic control, outstanding protection against potential neuropathy and sensorimotor coordination, maintained robust retinal integrity and provided significant control for diabetic nephropathy. Mechanistically, the significant improvement in BMZ with metformin in controlling retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are directly linked to (1) Increased glycemic control (antihyperglycemic effect), (2) increased insulin sensitivity as evidenced by reduced HOMA-IR levels, (3) reduced oxidative stress (4) increased antioxidant activity through increased glutathione levels and increased GSH/GSSG ratio, and (5) improved regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as evidenced by metabolomic data. This study provides robust and direct evidence to support the use of affordable, proven antioxidant and mineral combinations with metformin to reduce diabetes-related complications in aging.}

In this study, we produced fibrous MPs, whose lengths and widths were in accordance with the natural environment, and further, investigated the potential adverse effect of which on the asthma in a OVA (ovalbumin)-induced mice model, aiming at exploring the true life hazard of MP to the respiratory system. Following nasal exposure to fibrous MPs, the airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and fibrosis were aggravated in asthmatic mice. Fibrous MPs exposure also significantly increased the levels of total IgE, and, cardinal Th2 and Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines participated in the etiopathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. In addition, MP fibers exposure induced lung epithelial cells apoptosis, disruption of epithelial barrier integrity and activation of NLRP3 related signaling pathways. Moreover, fibrous MPs significantly altered the bacterial composition at the genus level. Compared to the control group, the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Uncultured were decreased to 4.47% and 0.15% in OVA group, while Blautia and Prevotella were elevated to 4.96% and 2.94%. For the OVA + MPs group, the relative abundance of Blautia and Uncultured were decreased to 2.27% and 0.006%, while Prevotella was increased to 3.05%.

This review article explores how such nongenerative AI methods, rooted in traditional rules-based systems, enhance diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and consistency within medicine. Key concepts and the application of supervised learning models (ie, classification and regression) such as decision trees, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, and neural networks are explained along with the newer landscape of neural network-based nongenerative foundation models. Unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, are also discussed for their roles in uncovering novel disease subtypes or identifying outliers. Technical details related to the application of nongenerative AI algorithms for analyzing whole slide images are also highlighted. The performance, explainability, and reliability of nongenerative AI models essential for clinical decision-making is also reviewed, as well as challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and risk of data drift. An understanding of which AI-ML models to employ and which shortcomings need to be addressed is imperative to safely and efficiently leverage, integrate, and monitor these traditional AI tools in clinical practice and research.}

abstract = {Background
Poly (ADP ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) are a treatment option for patients with advanced high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian carcinoma (OC). Recent guidelines have clarified how homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may influence treatment decision-making in this setting. As a result, numerous companion diagnostic assays (CDx) have been developed to identify HRD. However, the optimal HRD testing strategy is an area of debate. Moreover, recently published clinical and translational data may impact how HRD status may be used to identify patients likely to benefit from PARPi use. We aimed to extensively compare available HRD CDx and establish a worldwide expert consensus on HRD testing in primary and recurrent OC.
Methods
A group of 99 global experts from 31 different countries was formed. Using a modified Delphi process, the experts aimed to establish consensus statements based on a systematic literature search and CDx information sought from investigators, companies and/or publications.
Results
Technical information, including analytical and clinical validation, were obtained from 14 of 15 available HRD CDx (7 academic; 7 commercial).

abstract = {After traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), inflammation and other reactive processes exacerbate tissue damage and impair long-term motor recovery. Extracellular traps (ETs) are an immune cell effector function first described in neutrophils wherein chromatin is decondensed, decorated with cytotoxic granule enzymes, and expelled from the cell body. Recently, ETs have been linked to poor functional outcomes in SCI; however, translatable agents to prevent ET-mediated damage after SCI have yet to be explored. We assessed recombinant human (rh) DNase (trade name Pulmozyme) as a potential therapeutic that could be repurposed to break down ETs after SCI. To determine the timing of treatment, we characterized the timeline of ET formation in a thoracic contusion model of SCI in mice. We found that ETs levels increased in the injured spinal cord by 4 h post injury (hpi), peaking within 24 hpi. When rhDNase was administered at 1 hpi, DNase activity in the serum remained elevated for 24 hpi with a corresponding increase in circulating ET fragments. At 6 hpi, blood-spinal cord barrier permeability was attenuated in rhDNase-treated animals. Long-term functional hind limb recovery, as assessed by the ladder rung walking test, was improved at 35 dpi in rhDNase-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. RhDNase-treated animals also exhibited shorter SCI lesion lengths at 35 dpi. Altogether, our data demonstrate the potential of rhDNase as an anti-ET therapeutic to improve long-term SCI outcomes.}

During tissue repair or regeneration, several bioactive molecules are released and interact with each other and act as complex additives or inhibitors for tissue reconstruction. In this study, the bone-healing effects of the combination treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibition, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) release by gene silencing, and gene transfection with calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaP) in the rat femoral head was histologically, morphologically, and biochemically evaluated.
Methods
A triple-functionalized paste of CaP carrying plasmid DNA encoding for BMP-7 and for VEGF), and siRNA against TNF-α was developed and denoted as CaP3mix. To compare the effects of 3mixCaP, CaP with plasmid DNA encoding BMP-7, VEGF, or siRNA encoding TNF-α was prepared and denoted as CaP/PEI/pBMP-7/SiO2, CaP/PEI/pVEGF/SiO2, or CaP/PEI/siRNA-TNF-α/SiO2, respectively. The bone healing in bone defects in the rat femoral head was investigated after 10 and 21 days of implantation.
Results
The levels of bone formation-related markers OCN, Runx2, and SP7 increased at the protein and gene levels in 3mixCaP after 10 days, and 3mixCaP significantly accelerated bone healing compared with the other treatments after 21 days of implantation.
Conclusion
The triple-functionalized CaP paste loading plasmid DNA encoding BMP-7 and VEGF and siRNA encoding TNF-α is a promising bioactive material for bone tissue repair.}

keywords = {emerging adulthood, design thinking, mental health promotion, mental ill-health, needs assessment, artificial intelligence, AI},
abstract = {Background
Young adults experience stressors in their transition to adulthood and are at increased risk of mental ill-health. This risk is compounded by young adults’ low levels of mental health literacy and limited competencies in implementing strategies promoting mental health and well-being in their daily lives. Previous research suggests that digital mental health apps may be particularly effective in increasing the mental health literacy of young adults. In Sweden, there is a lack of research on young adults’ unique perspectives on what constitutes mental health, well-being, and ill-health—perspectives that could inform the coproduction of evidence-based interventions targeting these issues.
Objective
The overarching aim of this study was to conduct a needs assessment as part of coproducing a digital mental health app for Swedish young adults. More specifically, the study addressed two research questions: (1) What do Swedish young adults perceive as contributing to the mental health, well-being, and ill-health of themselves and their peers? (2) What are Swedish young adults’ preferences and ideas on how a digital mental health app can support their mental health during young adulthood, including their perspectives on the app’s usability?
Methods
We conducted semistructured interviews with 16 young adults and analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
Of the 16 study participants, 9 (56%) identified as women and 7 (44%) as men. Their mean age was 23.6 (SD 4.22; range 18-29) years. Furthermore, 56% (9/16) were pursuing or had obtained a higher education degree, while 44% (7/16) had completed or were in the process of completing a high school diploma. The interviews and subsequent analysis revealed three main themes: (1) “To feel that life is worth living”—pathways through pressures and pursuit of mental well-being during young adulthood, (2) “A personal space for working on one’s own mental well-being”—digital companionship with others, and (3) “Something that is designed for me”—customizing one’s digital mental health journey.
Conclusions
In line with the preferences of Swedish young adults, the promotion of mental health and well-being through digital technology and eHealth should focus on a customizable app that supports balance in daily life while strengthening mental health competencies. The content should center on fostering and maintaining meaningful relationships and activities, addressing challenges such as negative social media use and stress recovery, and enhancing mental health knowledge and peer support. Future efforts should focus on researching young adults’ experiences of the life phase of emerging adulthood and its implications for mental health. In addition, future technical development and research on digital mental health apps should include the perspectives of stakeholders, such as mental health professionals, and involve prototype testing with diverse groups to ensure the app’s relevance, user engagement, and effectiveness.}

Spray drying based on atomization using high pressure or supercritical CO2 has been shown to be effective in improving therapeutic efficiency of drugs by forming smaller particles, owing to the distinct solvation power and enhanced mixing potential of supercritical CO2. Several parameters contribute to the critical quality attributes of the final atomized pharmaceutical products resulting from CO2-assisted atomization including high-pressure nozzle design, drying chamber geometry, and operating pressures and temperatures. In this context, the work is focused on a detailed analysis of supercritical CO2 through micro-orifices used in a spray drying enhanced atomization process. We present a computational fluid dynamics model, developed using Ansys FLUENT, to describe the flow of pure, pressurized CO2 through a micro-orifice undergoing trans-critical expansion. After establishing grid independence, the computational model was validated by comparing model predictions to measured mass flow rates and temperature distribution of the cooling effect of CO2 free jet over an adiabatic surface. For supercritical inlet conditions and a nozzle orifice size of 80 µm, experimental results matched predictions reasonably well. The simulated results demonstrated the occurrence of shock waves, a prerequisite for fine droplets formation. Simulated results were critically analyzed to develop new insights into intricate fluid dynamics of flow of CO2 through atomization orifices and an attempt is made to evolve specific guidelines. The presented model and results will be useful for researchers and engineers interested in understanding and optimizing CO2-assisted spray atomization processes.}

abstract = {Background
The quality and accessibility of menstrual health education (MHE) in low- and middle-income countries, including India, remain inadequate due to persistent challenges (eg, poverty, social stigma, and gender inequality). While community-driven initiatives have sought to raise awareness, artificial intelligence offers a scalable and efficient solution for disseminating accurate information. However, existing general-purpose large language models (LLMs) are often ill-suited for this task, tending to exhibit low accuracy, cultural insensitivity, and overly complex responses. To address these limitations, we developed MenstLLaMA—a specialized LLM tailored to the Indian context and designed to deliver MHE empathetically, supportively, and accessibly.
Objective
We aimed to develop and evaluate MenstLLaMA—a specialized LLM tailored to deliver accurate, culturally sensitive MHE—and assess its effectiveness in comparison to existing general-purpose models.
Methods
We curated MENST—a novel, domain-specific dataset comprising 23,820 question-answer pairs aggregated from medical websites, government portals, and health education resources. This dataset was systematically annotated with metadata capturing age groups, regions, topics, and sociocultural contexts. MenstLLaMA was developed by fine-tuning Meta-LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, using parameter-efficient fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation to achieve domain alignment while minimizing computational overhead. We benchmarked MenstLLaMA against 9 state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Mistral. The evaluation followed a multilayered framework: (1) automatic evaluation using standard natural language processing metrics (BLEU [Bilingual Evaluation Understudy], METEOR [Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering], ROUGE-L [Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation-Longest Common Subsequence], and BERTScore [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score]); (2) evaluation by clinical experts (N=18), who rated 200 expert-curated queries for accuracy and appropriateness; (3) medical practitioner interaction through the ISHA (Intelligent System for Menstrual Health Assistance) interactive chatbot, assessing qualitative dimensions (eg, relevance, understandability, preciseness, correctness, and context sensitivity); and (4) a user study with volunteer participants (N=200), who evaluated MenstLLaMA in 15- to 20-minute randomized sessions, rating the system across 7 qualitative user satisfaction metrics.
Results
MenstLLaMA achieved the highest scores in BLEU (0.059) and BERTScore (0.911), outperforming GPT-4o (BLEU: 0.052, BERTScore: 0.896) and Claude-3 (BERTScore: 0.888). Clinical experts preferred MenstLLaMA’s responses over gold-standard answers in several culturally sensitive cases. In medical practitioners’ evaluations using the ISHA—the chat interface powered by MenstLLaMA—the model scored 3.5 in relevance, 3.6 in understandability, 3.1/5 in preciseness, 3.5/5 in correctness, and 4.0/5 in context sensitivity. User evaluations indicated even stronger results, with ratings of 4.7/5 for understandability, 4.3/5 for relevance, 4.28/5 for preciseness, 4.1/5 for correctness, 4.6/5 for tone, 4.2/5 for flow, and 3.9/5 for context sensitivity.
Conclusions
MenstLLaMA demonstrates exceptional accuracy, empathy, and user satisfaction within the domain of MHE, bridging critical gaps left by general-purpose LLMs. Its potential for integration into broader health education platforms positions it as a transformative tool for menstrual well-being. Future research could explore its long-term impact on public perception and menstrual hygiene practices, while expanding demographic representation, enhancing context sensitivity, and integrating multimodal and voice-based interactions to improve accessibility across diverse user groups.}

Generally, the quality of a synthetically generated object could refer to the reliability of the content, to the lexical variety or coherence of the text. Regarding the quality of text generation, an aspect that up to now has not been adequately discussed is concerning the readability of textual artefacts. This work focuses on the latter aspect, proposing a set of experiments aiming to better understanding and evaluating the degree of readability of texts automatically generated by an LLM. The analysis is performed through an empirical study based on: considering a subset of five pre-trained LLMs; considering a pool of English text generation tasks, with increasing difficulty, assigned to each of the models; and, computing a set of the most popular readability indexes available from the computational linguistics literature. Readability indexes will be computed for each model to provide a first perspective of the readability of textual contents artificially generated can vary among different models and under different requirements of the users. The results obtained by evaluating and comparing different models provide interesting insights, especially into the responsible use of these tools by both beginners and not overly experienced practitioners.}

AI chatbots, powered by large data models, have emerged as a crucial tool for enhancing customer service and user experience. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI chatbot problem-solving capabilities on users’ intention to continue using these services within e-commerce platforms. By integrating elements from the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a comprehensive research model is proposed to examine the relationships between problem-solving, confirmation, perceived ease of use, satisfaction, trust, and continued usage intention. The study employs structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse data collected from 315 participants through an online questionnaire. The findings reveal that problem-solving abilities positively influence users’ confirmation, which in turn positively affects satisfaction, perceived ease of use, and trust. Furthermore, perceived ease of use exhibits a positive impact on satisfaction, trust, and continued usage intention. Satisfaction and trust have a positive impact on continued usage intention, with satisfaction showing a stronger influence than both problem-solving ability and ease of use. The study contributes to the theoretical understanding of user perceptions and behaviours in AI-driven interactions within e-commerce platforms. It highlights the importance of problem-solving capabilities, perceived ease of use, satisfaction, and trust in driving users’ continued engagement with AI chatbots. Practical implications for AI technology developers and e-commerce companies are discussed, emphasizing the need to focus on enhancing chatbots’ problem-solving proficiency and user-friendliness to foster long-term user retention.

In general, after connecting a driver’s smartphone to the IVI system via Bluetooth, WiFi, or USB, she or he can make phone calls, use short message service (SMS), perform media playback, and utilize navigation functions of the smartphone. As a result, various vehicle-related data can be stored in the smartphone linked to the IVI system. Therefore, it is possible to obtain digital evidence through forensic investigation of the smartphone if a suspect has used his or her smartphone while connected to a vehicle’s IVI system. In this paper, we propose a new forensic technique to collect and analyze Android log messages as well as Bluetooth HCI snoop log left on Android phones which have interacted with vehicles’ IVI system via Bluetooth. The Android log messages are stored in multiple circular buffers kept by the Android logging system. The Bluetooth HCI snoop log, a type of log file, is a record of all Host Controller Interface (HCI) commands and events transmitted through Bluetooth on an Android device. From the two forensic data sources, we have identified lots of digital artifacts including as MAC address of the connected vehicle, the vehicle information, the time when being connected and disconnected to a vehicle, phone call history, etc. We also analyze the differences of digital artifacts obtained from the Android log messages and the Bluetooth HCI packets. We finally construct a timeline of the examined driver’s behaviors and vehicle events in terms of vehicle forensics.}

abstract = {Background
Online record access (ORA) is being increasingly implemented internationally. Despite reported benefits for patients, health care professionals (HCPs) have raised concerns about potential disadvantages. To date, no review has examined the empirical evidence on whether and how documentation changes following the introduction of patients’ ORA.
Objective
This scoping review aimed to examine potential subjective and objective changes in HCPs’ documentation after using patients’ ORA.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted using a methodological framework for scoping reviews and data from 4 electronic databases. Studies examining objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation following the implementation of ORA, specifically those related to actual use experiences (rather than previous expectations), up to July 2023, were included. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the included studies. The narrative synthesis and reporting of findings were guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews).
Results
Of the 3143 papers screened, 42 (1.34%) were included in this review. The included studies mainly used qualitative methods and were predominantly published after 2016 in the United States. The included studies were conducted in different settings (inpatient and outpatient) and clinical areas (somatic, mental health, and other). In total, 8 studies analyzed clinical notes, while the remaining studies focused on the experiences of patients, HCPs, and other stakeholders with ORA. Objectively, a decrease in complexity, an increase in readability, and a change in the emotional tone of the clinical notes were observed. The length of the clinical notes was observed to change both objectively and subjectively, although the direction of this change was inconclusive. However, many HCPs also reported writing notes that were less open and more restrictive to protect sensitive or hypothetical information. While for some HCPs the implementation of ORA made the clinical notes a less efficient and valuable working tool, others perceived that ORA opened up new therapeutic opportunities through direct contact with patients.
Conclusions
The question of whether an inherently uniform clinical note can meet the diverse needs of different health care stakeholders remains unresolved, highlighting the challenges of standardizing practices in this complex sector. While ORA may encourage HCPs to make their clinical notes more patient friendly, it may also compromise the integrity of documentation by omitting sensitive findings and expert judgment, which can put patients at risk and lead to errors that increase the risk of malpractice. Given the limitations of digital documentation in fostering trust, it is imperative to prioritize meaningful patient-HCP interactions. The use of compensatory measures, such as parallel documentation and restricted access to clinical notes, indicates systemic problems and suggests that current practices are suboptimal.

abstract = {Background
The practice of providing patients with digital access to clinical narrative documentation by health care professionals (HCPs) is known as open notes. In mental health care, this innovation has the potential to increase transparency and foster greater trust in the treatment process. While open notes may improve the quality of care and patient engagement, some HCPs are concerned that they may change the nature of clinical documentation and compromise its quality.
Objective
This study aims to examine potential objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation following the implementation of open notes.
Methods
Clinical notes written before and after the implementation of a patient portal with open notes function in 3 psychiatric outpatient clinics in Germany were collected. A total of 876 notes (453 prenotes and 423 postnotes) were rated on 16 linguistic features using a Likert scale. Differences were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. In addition, 10 in-depth qualitative interviews with psychiatric HCPs were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
Postimplementation significant differences were found in several linguistic features: Monoglossic (P=.002), incomprehensible (P<.001), demeaning (P<.001), stigmatizing (P<.001), factual (P<.001), and controlling (P=.002) language decreased, while comprehensible (P<.001), resource-oriented (P<.001), heteroglossic (P<.001), personal (P<.001), and emotional positive (P=.047) language increased. Interviewed HCPs reported noticeable changes in both their clinical notes and documentation practices. They described reducing the use of medical jargon, providing more detailed explanations, and tailoring documentation to better meet patient needs, resulting in slightly longer notes. However, in the subjective perception of the HCPs, the information they documented in the clinical notes remained mostly the same. HCPs noted an increase in time and workload associated with the new documentation approach, partly due to the workflow adjustments required to adapt to open notes.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically analyze quantitative documentation changes in the field of mental health. The implementation of open notes seems to result in both objective and subjective changes in clinical documentation and documentation practices. Quantitative and qualitative findings from our study suggest that HCPs generally strove to create more patient-friendly notes. In practice, this may benefit both patients and the therapeutic relationship. For open notes to be sustainable in practice, they must be seamlessly and efficiently integrated into HCPs' daily workflows. This requires not only structural changes, but also educating HCPs—both during their training and in clinical practice—on how to write open notes in a way that is both effective and patient-friendly.

abstract = {Purpose
To describe the current use cases of large language models (LLMs) in musculoskeletal medicine and to evaluate the methodologic conduct of these investigations in order to safeguard future implementation of LLMs in clinical research and identify key areas for methodological improvement.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases to identify eligible studies. Included studies evaluated the use of LLMs within any realm of orthopaedic surgery, regardless of its application in a clinical or educational setting. Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria was used to assess the quality of all included studies.
Results
In total, 114 studies published from 2022 to 2024 were identified. Extensive use case redundancy was observed, and 5 main categories of clinical applications of LLMs were identified: 48 studies (42.1%) that assessed the ability to answer patient questions, 24 studies (21.1%) that evaluated the ability to diagnose and manage medical conditions, 21 studies (18.4%) that evaluated the ability to take orthopaedic examinations, 11 studies (9.6%) that analyzed the ability to develop or evaluate patient educational materials, and 10 studies (8.8%) concerning other applications, such as generating images, generating discharge documents and clinical letters, writing scientific abstracts and manuscripts, and enhancing billing efficiency. General orthopaedics was the focus of most included studies (n = 39, 34.2%), followed by orthopaedic sports medicine (n = 18, 15.8%), and adult reconstructive surgery (n = 17, 14.9%). ChatGPT 3.5 was the most common LLM used or evaluated (n = 79, 69.2%), followed by ChatGPT 4.0 (n = 47, 41.2%). Methodological inconsistency was prevalent among studies, with 36 (31.6%) studies failing to disclose the exact prompts used, 64 (56.1%) failing to disclose the exact outputs generated by the LLM, and only 7 (6.1%) evaluating different prompting strategies to elicit desired outputs. No studies attempted to investigate how the influence of race or gender influenced model outputs.
Conclusions
Among studies evaluating LLM health care use cases, the scope of clinical investigations was limited, with most studies showing redundant use cases. Because of infrequently reported descriptions of prompting strategies, incomplete model specifications, failure to disclose exact model outputs, and limited attempts to address bias, methodological inconsistency was concerningly extensive.
Clinical Relevance
A comprehensive understanding of current LLM use cases is critical to familiarize providers with the possibilities through which this technology may be used in clinical practice. As LLM health care applications transition from research to clinical integration, model transparency and trustworthiness is critical. The results of the current study suggest that guidance is urgently needed, with focus on promoting appropriate methodological conduct practices and novel use cases to advance the field.}

The prevalent use of biological processes raises concerns due to potential environmental impacts caused by N2O emissions. However, partial nitritation-anaerobic ammonium oxidation demonstrated economic benefits and the potential for positive environmental outcomes when properly operated and controlled. Furthermore, reject water, in many cases, provides sufficient nitrogen concentrations for nitrogen recovery processes, such as ammonia stripping, substituting production of industrial fertilizers and contributing to a circular economy. Nonetheless, their financial competitiveness is subject to various conditions, including the nitrogen concentration or reject water flow. As the environmental benefits of bioprocesses and economic benefits of nitrogen recovery processes may vary, it is crucial to further optimize both and investigate novel promising technologies such as electrochemical systems, denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation or direct ammonia oxidation.}

In spite of the fact that today’s supply chains are global, it is surprising the current research lacks studies primarily focusing on Latin American (LATAM) firms. To enhance our understanding in this domain, this study examines the impact of technology investments on inventory turnover, asset turnover and employee productivity measures within the LATAM context.
Design/methodology/approach
We use an unbalanced panel of over 2,101 firm-year observations from the Worldscope database between 2010 and 2022 and limit our analysis to firms located in the Latin American region. We use panel data and regression analysis to test our hypotheses.
Findings
The findings reveal a positive impact of technology investments on inventory turnover, asset turnover and employee productivity.
Originality/value
There is a dearth of research in the discipline primarily focusing on the firms from the LATAM region. The extant literature has largely focused on the Western firms and we know from prior cross-cultural research that there are significant differences in terms of how firms and governments operate differently in emerging and non-Western regions such as LATAM or parts of Asia and Africa. By specifically focusing on a sample of LATAM firms, the study makes important contributions to the extant literature with respect to the role of technology investments in improving inventory turnover, and also on asset turnover and employee productivity. The study further provides implications for practice.}

Preclinical studies indicate that CDK4/6i may collaborate by influencing DNA damage repair pathways during radiotherapy. Since PARP1 expression was also significantly upregulated in NSCLC, we analyzed the efficacy of combining PARP1 and CDK4/6 inhibition in NSCLC models. We found that CDK4/6is synergize with PARP1 inhibitors (PARPis) to inhibit the clonogenic growth of RB-proficient NSCLC models. This synergy correlates with increased accumulation of DNA damage, interrupted cell-cycle checkpoints, and enhanced apoptotic cell death. Mechanistically, we showed that CDK4/6is promote PARP1 protein degradation, which lead to decreased availability of DNA repair factors involved in homologous recombination and suppression of DNA repair competency. Furthermore, we showed that PARP trapping is engaged in this synergy. We then confirmed that combining PARPi and CDK4/6i blocked the growth of NSCLC xenografts in vivo and patient-derived explant models ex vivo. Our data reveal a previously uncharacterized impact of CDK4/6i on PARP1 levels in RB-proficient NSCLC models and the engagement of PARP trapping in the synergy between CDK4/6i and PARPi. Our findings suggest combining CDK4/6i with PARPi could be a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with RB-proficient NSCLC.}

abstract = {Background
Misinformation in health and health care contexts threatens public health by undermining initiatives, spreading dangerous behaviors, and influencing decision-making. Given its reach on online platforms and social media, there is growing demand for interventions addressing misinformation. Literature highlights the importance of theoretical underpinnings (frameworks and models) to guide the development of educational interventions targeting both the features of misinformation and the human traits that increase susceptibility.
Objective
This review examines literature on online interventions targeting health misinformation to mitigate adverse public health impacts. It explores intervention types, population demographics, susceptibility-related human attributes, and misinformation characteristics addressed. It also identifies the theoretical underpinnings used and gaps in the literature.
Methods
The review followed a methodological framework and adhered to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A search strategy combining Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords was used to search five databases for studies published between 2018 and 2024. Identified studies underwent deduplication, title and abstract screening using predefined eligibility criteria, full-text screening, and data extraction.
Results
The initial search yielded 513 citations; 30 (5.8%) studies were included after screening. Of these, 19 (63%) focused on COVID-19 misinformation, 11 (37%) on other health contexts, and 1 (3%) addressed misinformation conceptually. Regarding intervention type, 22 (73%) used educational courses, 7 (23%) employed counter speech, and 1 (3%) used inoculation games, with some overlap. Sixteen (53%) interventions targeted characteristics of misinformation, categorized as content and presentation tactics, cognitive and psychological biases, social and cultural influences, and dissemination strategies. Seven (23%) interventions focused on specific demographics, while 14 (47%) addressed human attributes that heighten susceptibility. These attributes were grouped into knowledge and processing, emotional and psychological factors, and trust and social dynamics. Theoretical underpinnings guided intervention development in 23 (77%) studies, often overlapping in categories including inoculation and correction, education and cognition, motivation and emotion, behavior and persuasion, trust and belief, and learning design.
Conclusions
Online interventions targeting health misinformation often share outcome goals and use overlapping strategies such as educational courses, counter speech, and inoculation games. Many adopt multifaceted approaches to address misinformation’s complexity. However, gaps remain in tailoring interventions to misinformation characteristics that could improve specificity and impact. Few studies focus on human attributes contributing to belief in and spread of misinformation, particularly among vulnerable groups. While theoretical models are commonly cited, clearer reporting and stronger connections to intervention design are needed. Collaboration among intervention developers, theorists, and psychologists is recommended to enhance future interventions.

The study investigated the effectiveness of machine learning methods in air quality prediction, using the datasets from Shillong City in India. Key variables used in this study were particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitric oxide (NO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), and ozone (O3). The machine learning methods used in this study were AdaBoost, LightGBM and Support Vector Machine. Correlation analysis of variables with the Air Quality Index (AQI) revealed that O3 and NO had weak correlations with the AQI (r = 0.37 and 0.01, respectively), which justified their exclusion from model construction. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets. LightGBM outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 0.86, whilst the AdaBoost had the second-best results. The Support Vector Machine had an accuracy of 0.827. This illustrates the usefulness of the LightGBM method in predicting air quality, providing knowledge for efficient air quality management. PM2.5 and PM10 had the greatest impact on LightGBM model results, and this illustrates the usefulness of monitoring these two air pollutants in air quality management. The LightGBM model proved to be very efficacious in predicting air quality in the given environment, considering the complex nature of the data. The model results may inform interventions for air pollution management in similar areas. Policies and regulations should therefore pay greater attention to sources of particulate matter pollution in Shillong City and develop appropriate interventions.}

Here, in 34 young adults (18 female; age from 19 to 26 years) with no prior caregiving experience, we used an infant cry feedback paradigm to characterize individual differences in behavioral adjustment and their neural correlates. Participants judged the cause of infant cries while their reaction time changes (ΔRT) and EEG were recorded. Our results revealed context-specific adjustment biases unique to infant cries, distinct from responses to animal vocalizations. Within the infant crying context, a negative-feedback bias (slowing after negative feedback) correlated with higher self-reported caregiving sensitivity, whereas a positive-feedback bias (slowing after positive feedback) correlated with lower caregiving motivation. Inter-subject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) further revealed a key asymmetry in neural responses, showing that higher negative-feedback bias was associated with greater inter-subject neural similarity during negative feedback (480–1000 ms) and positive feedback (600–700 ms), whereas higher positive-feedback bias was associated with more idiosyncratic neural patterns. Furthermore, a mediation analysis showed that the influence of the Late Positive Potential (LPP) on caregiving sensitivity was fully mediated by these behavioral adjustments, where lower LPP amplitudes predicted greater slowing after negative feedback, which in turn predicted higher intended infant caregiving sensitivity. These findings link specific behavioral adjustments to an asymmetric neural similarity structure, offering potential markers for caregiving dispositions and highlighting the importance of feedback processing in caregiver-infant interactions.}

In this paper, we present an AI-based inverse design framework that effectively and efficiently generates FRPCs with targeted nonlinear stress-strain responses. We introduce a physically constrained diffusion model (PC3D_Diffusion) capable of managing the complexities of composite materials and producing detailed, high-quality designs. We propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to generate physically feasible microstructure designs by explicitly enforcing physical constraints during the generation process. For training purposes, 1.35 million FRPC samples were created, and their corresponding stress-strain curves were computed using established physics-based computational models. The results show that PC3D_Diffusion consistently generates high-quality designs with tailored mechanical behaviors, while guaranteeing compliance with the physical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may facilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential applications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical properties.}

During its ripening process, the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) content has been reported to increase. However, a comprehensive understanding of ABA's specific role in durian fruit ripening remains elusive. Furthermore, little is known about the molecular aspects of the carotenoid cleavage pathway in this iconic fruit. Therefore, we performed genome-wide identification of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase (CCO) family in durian. This family includes the nine-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) responsible for ABA production and the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases exhibiting diverse substrate specificities. Through phylogenetic analysis, we classified 14 CCOs in durian into 8 distinct subfamilies. Notably, each DzCCO subfamily displayed a conserved motif composition. Cis-acting element prediction showed that cis-elements related to plant hormones and environmental stress responses were distributed in the DzCCO promoter. In addition, transcriptome analysis was performed to examine the expression pattern during the fruit development and ripening stages. Interestingly, DzNCED5a, a ripening-associated gene, exhibited the highest expression level at the ripe stage, outperforming other CCOs. Its expression markedly correlated with increased ABA contents during the ripening stages of both the “Monthong” variety and other durian cultivars. Transiently expressed DzNCED5a in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves confirmed its function in ABA biosynthesis. These findings highlight the involvement of DzNCED5a in ABA production and its potential importance in durian fruit ripening. Overall, this study provides insights into the significance of CCOs in durian fruit ripening.}

Humanitarian organizations, often established temporarily in response to crises, face management challenges due to the voluntary nature of the work carried out by humanitarian actors. As a result, scholars have sought to propose alternative theories to understand better and explain the intricate nature of humanitarian relief operations.

abstract = {Household chores as activities of daily living positively affect young children's development, allowing children to build knowledge and confront real-life challenges, which cannot be separated from problem-solving ability. Problem-solving ability is a key factor in early childhood development, furnishing children with vital cognitive and behavioral strategies for navigating diverse future scenarios. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between participating in household chores and problem-solving abilities among young children and the role of parental scaffolding from the perspective of parent-child interactive dynamics in two steps. First, young children (n = 125, Mage = 4.13-year-old, SD = 0.61) participated in problem-solving tasks, while concurrently, their parents completed a structured questionnaire evaluating children's household chore involvement and parental scaffolding strategies. The second study analyzed the patterns of parental scaffolding using videos of parent-child interactions(n = 31). The results revealed a significant positive correlation between involvement in household chores and problem-solving ability, with parental scaffolding moderating this relationship. Moreover, video analyses revealed a pattern of high-level parental scaffolding during problem solving for household chores. Specifically, parents tended to provide more cognitive scaffolding in the initial stages of problem solving, gradually reduce interventions as the task progressed to allow the child to feel autonomy, and provide high-quality emotional scaffolding throughout the task. These findings highlight the positive effect of participation in household chores on the development of problem-solving abilities among young children as well as the importance of parental scaffolding being provided and withdrawn in a timely manner according to young children's needs.}

Although many efforts are devoted to combat them, generic anti-phishing awareness and training campaigns have shown limited success. In this context, considering individuals’ personality traits in relation to phishing behaviour could significantly enhance cybersecurity defence strategies. In this article, we concentrate on personality traits and their effects on vulnerability to phishing attacks. We implement a rigorous systematic review following the methodology proposed by vom Brocke et al. (2009) along with the PRISMA statement. We searched five major databases (i.e., Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed), with an all-years’ time span from 1900 to January 2025. From the 1919 articles yielded in the initial search, 26 satisfied all criteria. Results reveal that extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism generally show a positive association with phishing vulnerability, whereas conscientiousness emerges as a protective factor. The review also highlights significant gaps in the current methodologies used to measure phishing vulnerability, noting a lack of standardised measurement tools to perform phishing experiments. Finally, this study underscores the need to develop secondary prevention strategies targeting at-risk groups to combat the increasingly sophisticated phishing threats. To enhance consistency in future research, the Appendix includes guidelines for measuring phishing vulnerability under experimental conditions.}

abstract = {Background
In guiding treatment decisions for pancreatic cancer, assessing vascular invasion is critical, particularly for determining resectability. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated potential for diagnosing vascular invasion through the analysis of pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images. However, challenges arise when dealing with multicenter data sources and imbalanced datasets, which may affect the performance of deep learning models.
Method
EUS images were collected from 170 patients with pancreatic cancer diagnosed at three endoscopy centers using various ultrasound systems. To diagnose vascular invasion while mitigating data variations, feature and image translation models were utilized to effectively align the source and target domains. An image translation model was utilized in the proposed approach (multicenter transfer learning (MCTL)) by employing CycleGAN and customized weighted loss classification models. The performance was compared with those of a feature translation model (multicenter domain adaptation (MCDA)) and widely accepted baseline classification models.
Result
The translation models compensated for the distinctive data-specific features and improved the models for classifying vascular invasion. Although the feature translation model proved effective, its applicability was limited across different datasets. The proposed MCTL approach showed superior classification performance with accuracy improvements of 26.79%, 67.26%, and 50.91% over the baseline model and 17.86%, 48.81%, and 42.50% over the MCDA model for the three imbalanced datasets.
Significance
This study leveraged a deep learning approach for enhancing the diagnosis of vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer using EUS images from multiple centers and addressed the issue of data imbalance.}

In addition, AMD and myopia have been associated with impaired dopamine activity. Treatment of RPE cells with antioxidants or high concentrations of l-DOPA (levodopa), which down-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via a G-protein-coupled receptor GPR143, slow AMD progression. To develop a targeted and effective treatment aimed at improving the viability of RPE cells we examined small molecular weight thiol-based and levodopa containing molecules. These include the N-acetylcysteine amide (AD4/NACA), SuperDopa-Amide (SDA), and members of the thioredoxin mimetic (TXM) family of peptides, TXM-CB13, TXM-CB30, and SuperDopa (SD). We show that these antioxidant/anti-inflammatory reagents protect ARPE-19 cells from photic stress mediated by rose Bengal (rB) and rhodopsin-rich POS, and from non-photic stress induced by oxidation with sodium iodate. Protection is correlated with a reduction in DPPH radical and singlet-oxygen quenching. Compared to GSH the bimolecular rate-constants of singlet oxygen quenching in aqueous solution by the levodopa derivatives SD and SDA were two-fold higher. Inhibition of auranofin-induced activation of the mitogen-activation-kinases (MAPK's) JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 confirmed the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory activity of the thiol-levodopa derivatives. The antioxidant and radical scavenging activities of TXM-CB13 and TXM-CB30, or SD and SDA, which combine redox activity with elevating cellular levodopa, might offer an efficient protection of RPE cells. These retino-protective peptides are potential drug candidates destined for slowing the onset and/or progression of RPE-related disorders.}

This paper examines an artificial intelligence tutor like ChatGPT, enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation, in a pilot project at two universities. The advantage of retrieval-augmented generation in higher education is that lecturers can take control of the underlying literature used by the large language model. Four courses from three programs with different learning objectives and pedagogical methods were involved to provide as diverse a context as possible. We created an artificial intelligence tutor for each course, capable of answering students' questions by referring to the educational resources provided. Both students and lecturers reported positive experiences. Qualitative analysis of the chats shows a high level of engagement and motivation. Based on expert coding of a random sample, 1.5 % of answers were incorrect and 16.5 % were outside the context provided to the large language model. We found that retrieval-augmented generation reduces hallucinations for topics that are sufficiently explained in the material. Both the online survey results and the temporal pattern of the queries showed various learning strategies. Students used the tutor effectively, intuitively finding the most appropriate use for themselves. A comparison of different courses shows that the same tool can work differently in different contexts. Our results show that the artificial intelligence tutor does not simply impart knowledge, but mediates the relationship between student, lecturer, and course material. This mediation can facilitate learning, but it can also pose new challenges.}

Methodological details, including learning program design, learning outcomes assessment, ILE settings, and ChatGPT integration are presented. Results from pre- and post-assessment tests, quizzes, and students’ feedback on ChatGPT’s utility as a learning aid are discussed. The findings suggest a significant improvement in students’ comprehension and performance following their engagement with the ILE while using ChatGPT as a support tool. Despite a few drawbacks reported by the students in terms of the interfaces’ ease of use, and the timely response and appropriate content delivered by ChatGPT, they were overall satisfied with the experience. The students would recommend ChatGPT for learning purposes under certain controlled environments.

Five different species of Lactobacillus were isolated from the feces of PG-treated mice and L. murinus was identified to have the best anti-colitis effect, suggesting a critical role for L. murinus in mediating the therapeutic effect of PG. Furthermore, PG was degraded potentially by the beta-glucuronidase from L. murinus and adding PG to the culture medium of L. murinus remarkably increased its production of anti-inflammatory metabolites, including itaconic acid, cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and 3-amino-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-propionic acid. Additionally, L. salivarius, a human intestine-derived PG-utilizing species that is closely related to L. murinus, was also demonstrated to have potent anti-colitis effects, suggesting that it is a candidate target of PG in the human gut. Altogether, our study illustrates an unprecedented application of PG in the treatment of UC and establishes the basis for understanding its therapeutic effect from the perspective of L. murinus and its metabolites.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-derived biospecimens are invaluable tools in biomedical research. Currently, there are no mechanisms for patients to follow along and learn about the uses of their donated samples. Incorporating patients as stakeholders and meaningfully engaging them in biomedical research first requires transparency of research activities.
Objective
In this paper, we describe the use of participatory design methods to build a decentralized biobanking “de-bi” mobile app where patients could learn about biobanking, track their specimens, and engage with ongoing research via patient-friendly interfaces overlaying institutional biobank databases, initially developed for a breast cancer use case.
Methods
This research occurred in 2 phases. In phase 1, we designed app screens from which patients could learn about ongoing research involving their samples. We embedded these screens in a survey (n=94) to gauge patients’ interests regarding types of feedback and engagement opportunities; survey responses were probed during 6 comprehensive follow-up interviews. We then held an immersive participatory design workshop where participants (approximately 50) provided general feedback about our approach, with an embedded codesign workshop where a subset (n=15) provided targeted feedback on screen designs. For phase 2, we refined user interfaces and developed a functional app prototype in consultation with institutional stakeholders to ensure regulatory compliance, workflow compatibility, and composability with local data architectures. We presented the app at a second workshop, where participants (n=25, across 9 groups) shared thoughts on the app’s usability and design. In this phase, we conducted cognitive walkthroughs (n=13) to gain in-depth feedback on in-app task navigation.
Results
Most of the survey participants (61/81, 75%) were interested in learning the outcomes of research on their specimens, and 49% (41/83) were interested in connecting with others with the same diagnosis. Participants (47/60, 78%) expressed strong interest in receiving patient-friendly summaries of scientific information from scientists using their biospecimens. The first design workshop identified confusion in terminology and data presentation (eg, 9/15, 60% of co-designers were unclear on the biospecimens “in use”), though many appreciated the ability to view their personal biospecimens (7/15, 47%), and most were excited about connecting with others (12/15, 80%). In the second workshop, all groups found the app’s information valuable. Moreover, 44% (5/9) noted they did not like the onboarding process, which was echoed in cognitive walkthroughs. Walkthroughs further confirmed interest in biospecimen tracking, and 23% (3/13) had confusion about not finding any of their biospecimens in the app. These findings guided refinements in onboarding, design, and user experience.
Conclusions
Designing a patient-facing app that displays information about biobanked specimens can facilitate greater transparency and engagement in biomedical research. Co-designing the app with patient stakeholders confirmed interest in learning about biospecimens and related research, improved presentation of data, and ensured usability of the app in preparation for a pilot study.}

This study presents a scripted, reproducible approach to database curation and explores its potential to streamline oral medicine development. The Product Information files for all centrally authorized drug products containing a small molecule active ingredient were retrieved programmatically from the European Medicines Agency Web site. Text processing isolated relevant information, including the maximum clinical dose, dosage form, route of administration, excipients, and pharmacokinetic performance. Chemical and bioactivity data were integrated through automated linking to external curated databases. The capability of this database to inform oral medicine development was assessed in the context of drug-likeness evaluation, excipient selection, and prediction of oral fraction absorbed. Existing filters of drug-likeness, such as the Rule of Five, were found to poorly capture the chemical space of marketed oral drug products. Association rule learning identified frequent patterns in tablet formulation compositions that can be used to establish excipient combinations that have seen clinical success. Binary prediction models of oral fraction absorbed constructed exclusively from regulatory data achieved acceptable performance (balanced accuracytest = 0.725), demonstrating its modelability and potential for use during early stage molecule prioritization tasks. This study illustrates the impact of highly linked drug product data in accelerating clinical translation and underlines the ongoing need for accuracy and completeness of data reported in the regulatory datasphere.

Nevertheless, using RGB images to represent structural design drawings may not accurately capture the correlations and distinctions between building components, leading to shear-wall structure design inaccuracies. To address these challenges, this study proposes an optimized data representation and understanding method for the intelligent design of shear wall structures. Specifically, a component-based feature space data representation method was introduced to achieve a more accurate description of drawing features. A feature mask was also employed to precisely locate the key target areas for generating shear walls, enhancing the model's understanding of the data features. Additionally, a GAN with global and local discriminators was established to enhance the neural network's ability to generate shear wall designs at both the global image and local component levels. Finally, a training method for a GAN with dual discriminators based on feature masks is proposed. Experimental analyses and case studies showed that, compared with existing widely used GAN-based designs, the structural designs generated by the GAN trained with the proposed data representation and understanding methods demonstrated superior consistency with engineer-designed structures and outperformed structural seismic resistance.}

To facilitate the reuse of historical product data, designers require systematic and structured methods for data analysis and processing to enhance design efficiency. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a sophisticated statistical model adept at analyzing and forecasting sequential data patterns, is a powerful tool enabling designers to process and utilize historical product data effectively. This paper proposes a generative adaptable design method based on HMM to assist designers in rapidly generating design solutions. The proposed method utilizes HMM to model the structural modules and their connections within historical products, enabling designers to efficiently reuse existing product modules to generate diverse design configurations optimized to user requirements. Concurrently, a three-dimensional sparse matrix is used to mathematically represent the connection relations among module interfaces, facilitating the transformation of HMM-derived into design solutions with rational connections. The entropy method of product adaptability is utilized to evaluate the design solutions and identify the optimal solution. A case study of the design process for the Hybrid Additive Manufacturing device is conducted to verify the effectiveness of this method. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively assists designers in generating multiple design solutions and determining the optimal design outcome through the adaptability evaluation, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the design process.}

This paper adopts a qualitative approach by using constructivist grounded theory that draws on the experience of managers who work in the agrifood industry and are involved in implementing blockchain projects for Italian quality foods.
Findings
Findings allow the construction of an interpretive framework called the Blockchain Branding Model, which comprehensively interprets the interplay between blockchain and brand management. The Blockchain Branding Model comprises three levels that synthetize how blockchain intervenes in: accelerating brand enabling by providing new resources and digital assets, strengthening brand building by enriching brand identity and reinforcing brand positioning, and nurturing the brand–consumer relationship by bringing the consumer closer and tightening the bond.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first field works to explore the relationship between blockchain and branding by building a holistic model related to integrating blockchain into brand management. Results provide useful managerial implications related to strategic, operational, organizational and relational levels.}

abstract = {Background
Sleep games are an emerging topic in the realm of serious health game research. However, designing features that are both enjoyable and effective at engaging users, particularly university students, to develop healthy sleep habits remains a challenge.
Objective
This study aims to investigate user preferences for 3 sleep game prototypes, that is, Hero’s Sleep Journey, Sleep Tamagotchi, and Sleepland, and to explore their popularity and perceived utility in promoting sleep health.
Methods
A mixed methods approach was used in this study. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a co-design workshop involving 47 university students. Participants were presented with storyboard cards of game features and were asked to provide an overall rating on each game, as well as ratings for individual features. They were also encouraged to provide free-form comments on the features and suggest improvements. In addition, participants were asked to express their preferences among the 3 games regarding which game they would most like to play and which one they found most useful for promoting sleep health.
Results
Surprisingly, while Hero’s Sleep Journey was the most popular choice among participants, Sleep Tamagotchi was perceived as the most beneficial for improving sleep health. Relevance emerged as an overarching theme in the qualitative data analysis, with 3 interconnected dimensions: psychological relevance to users’ personal lives, logical relevance to sleep health, and situational relevance to users’ circumstantial context. We discussed how the 3 dimensions of relevance address the autonomy and relatedness constructs outlined in the self-determination theory and proposed 3 design recommendations.
Conclusions
Our serious sleep game prototypes demonstrated the potential to engage university students to develop healthy sleep hygiene. Future sleep game designs should aim to create a sense of relevance to users’ personal lives, sleep health goals, and situational contexts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, it is essential to develop a wide range of game genres and features to cater to diverse users. Aligning game features with sleep health goals and educating users on the design rationale through sleep knowledge are also important aspects. Furthermore, allowing users to customize their game experience and manage technology boundaries is necessary to nurture a sense of control and autonomy in the process of forming good sleep hygiene.}

Based on these properties, ten instrumental musical soundtracks were selected and evaluated for their capacity to evoke sustainability associations. The soundtracks were adapted to reflect environmental (overlaying jungle, forest, or beach sounds; Study 1) and social (overlaying talking, laughing, or cheering sounds; Study 2) dimensions. Results (combined N = 517) indicated that soundtracks aligned with sustainability descriptors reliably elicited strong perceptions of sustainability. Additionally, overlaying nature sounds enhanced associations with environmental sustainability, while incorporating human group sounds increased social sustainability associations. These findings demonstrate the potential of music and soundscapes to communicate abstract concepts, highlighting the importance of integrating musical elements with explicit sounds to evoke targeted sustainability perceptions. Harnessing such soundscapes may offer new avenues for organizations to communicate sustainability, with potential applications in brand and product experiential design.}

abstract = {Background
Cannabis consumption has increased in recent years, as has cannabis use disorder. While researchers have explored public online community discussions of active cannabis use, less is known about the popularity and content of publicly available online communities intended to support cannabis cessation.
Objective
This study aims to examine the level of engagement and dominant content of an online community for cannabis cessation through 3 specific aims. First, we examine the use of a subreddit cannabis cessation community (r/leaves) over time to evaluate the popularity of this type of resource for individuals who want to stop using cannabis. Second, we examine the content of posts in the community to identify popular topics related to cessation. Third, we compare the thematic findings relative to the 4 domains of recovery defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). By examining these 3 gaps, we take the initial steps toward understanding the experiences being shared online among individuals interested in cannabis cessation and compare them with the principles outlined in the SAMHSA definition of recovery.
Methods
Using the Pushshift application programming interface, we collected the count of posts by year between 2011 and 2021 and the narrative of the 100 posts with the most comments per year in a popular cannabis cessation–focused subreddit (r/leaves). A linear model and a nonlinear model were compared to evaluate change in the number of posts by year. Mixed natural language processing and qualitative analyses were applied to identify top terms, phrases, and themes present in posts over time. Overlap between themes and the 4 SAMHSA domains of recovery (health, purpose, community, and home) were examined.
Results
The number of annual posts in r/leaves increased from 420 in 2011 to 34,841 in 2021 (83-fold increase), with exponential growth since 2018. The term that was the most common across posts was “smoke” (2019 posts). Five major themes were identified, and a narrative arc was represented, from motivations and perceived benefits of cannabis use to the negative consequences of use, strategies to change behaviors, and the positive and negative consequences of change. There was substantial overlap between these 5 themes and 3 of SAMHSA’s 4 domains of recovery: health, purpose, and community. However, the domain of home was less commonly identified.
Conclusions
Engagement in this online cannabis support community appears to be increasing. Individuals using this forum discussed several topics, including multiple aspects of recovery defined by the SAMHSA. Online communities, such as this one may, serve as an important pathway for individuals seeking to reduce or cease their consumption of cannabis.}

This study presents an innovative view of how overripening and controlled temperature increase can significantly improve the production and diversity of bioactive peptides in salt-reduced cured Iberian hams. Forty-eight hams were divided into three groups: traditionally cured, overripened with 42 % weight loss at 30 °C, and overripened with 42 % weight loss at 36°. Comparing them, our results reveal significant advances in proteolysis, generating peptides with potent antioxidant and angiotensin converting enzyme-I (ACE-I) inhibitory activities. In particular, hams cured at 30 °C showed superior bioactive profiles, reaching the lowest IC50 values for ACE-I activity, while those processed at 36 °C exhibited the highest diversity, identifying 1,313 unique peptides by advanced nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In terms of antioxidant activity, overripeness significantly affected (p ≤ 0.05) antioxidant activity, with both overripened hams showing the highest antioxidant activity. These findings redefine the role of Iberian ham as a functional food with potential applications in cardiovascular and metabolic health management, while maintaining the authenticity and quality of traditional Iberian ham.}

The albumin nanocomposites were prepared by spray drying method using mannitol alone or in combination with 10 % or 20 % leucine as matrix. After formulation optimization of the albumin nanocomposites, 20 % albumin nanoparticle/70 % mannitol/10 % leucine (20 %NP/70 %M/10 %L) nanocomposite microparticles were selected as the optimized formulation. The nanocomposite comprising this optimized inhalation formulation formed spherical particles with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 25.5 ± 7.7 %. Homogeneous and stable CLZ-HSA-NPs were obtained after re-dispersion in water. Compared with bulk clofazimine, clofazimine-loaded nanocomposites exhibited rapid drug dissolution (74.9 ± 2.7 %, after 15 min). The amount of cellular uptake and the antibacterial effect of clofazimine in the nanocomposite microparticles were comparable to that of clofazimine solution. The albumin nanocomposite particles prepared in this study could be a promising inhalation formulation for clofazimine, a highly hydrophobic drug.}

Uncertainty at various stages of the visualization pipeline may give rise to misleading visual representations. These comprise misleading elements that may negatively impact the audiences by contributing to misinformed decisions, delayed treatments, and a lack of trust in medical information. We investigate whether visual narratives within the setting of an educational game support recognizing and addressing misleading elements in healthcare-related visualizations. Our methodological approach focuses on three key aspects: (i) identifying uncertainty types in the visualization pipeline which could serve as the origin of misleading elements, (ii) designing fictional visual narratives that comprise several misleading elements linking to these uncertainties, and (iii) proposing an interactive game that aids the communication of these misleading visualization elements to broad audiences. The game features eight fictional visual narratives built around misleading visualizations, each with specific assumptions linked to uncertainties. Players assess the correctness of these assumptions to earn points and rewards. In case of incorrect assessments, interactive explanations are provided to enhance understanding For an initial assessment of our game, we conducted a user study with 21 participants. Our study indicates that when participants incorrectly assess assumptions, they also spend more time elaborating on the reasons for their mistakes, indicating a willingness to learn more. The study also provided positive indications on game aspects such as memorability, reinforcement, and engagement, while it gave us pointers for future improvement.}

Based on these empirical and theoretical perspectives, this article proposes pausing, pondering, posing, and prioritizing as critical praxis that can be built into metacognitive activities. To explain this praxis, it showcases two kinds of metacognitive activities for fostering transnational habits among students through fact-checking processes. Similarly, it suggests designing the revision phase of writing assignments to allow students to incorporate their English language skills into the classroom. This paper identifies engaging in critical dialogue with ChatGPT and encouraging self-reflection on fact-checking and revision as effective ways to cultivate a transnational habitus among students. It concludes that adopting a transnational post-digital critical pedagogy and critical AI literacy in the writing process benefits both national and international students by promoting diverse linguistic norms and perspectives.}

However, existing CRS approaches face two critical challenges: limited incorporation of historical user interactions and unrealistic experimental settings that fail to reflect real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose FuseRec, a novel framework that enables any Sequential Recommender System (SRS) to function as a conversational recommender through integration with an ad-hoc Planner. The integration leverages the inherent strength of SRS in processing long-term historical interactions while the Planner learns conversation strategies. Additionally, a CRS module refines recommendations by incorporating conversational context, effectively fusing sequential patterns with real-time dialogue insights. To create realistic evaluation environments, we implement an advanced GenAI-based user simulator with stratified personas reflecting varying degrees of preference awareness, from users with clear preferences to those with abstract, uncertain preferences. To handle multi-faceted user behaviors, the Planner employs four sophisticated actions: Chitchat, semantic questioning (Semantic Q), attribute questioning (Attribute Q), and Recommend, dynamically adjusting based on user response patterns. We train the Planner through reinforcement learning with curriculum strategy based on user difficulty levels. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FuseRec significantly outperforms existing approaches in recommendation accuracy while showing remarkable adaptability across different user types and recommendation scenarios.}

This work provides a novel approach to boron-doped diamond patterning using nichrome masking for selective seeding on an oxidized silicon substrate. The optimized process involves nichrome deposition, sonication, chemical etching, seeding, and tailored chemical vapor deposition of boron-doped diamond with an intrinsic layer to suppress boron diffusion. Through a systematic investigation, it was determined that isolated boron-doped diamond band electrodes can be efficiently produced on non-conductive silica. Additionally, the influence of boron doping on electrochemical performance was studied, with higher doping enhancing the electrochemical response of band electrodes. To demonstrate sensing capabilities, boron-doped diamond bands were used to detect posaconazole, an antifungal drug, exploiting its electroactive behaviour. A linear correlation between posaconazole concentration and oxidation peak current was observed over 1.43 × 10−8 – 5.71 × 10−6 M with a 1.4 × 10−8 M detection limit. The developed boron-doped diamond microbands could significantly impact the field of electroanalysis, facilitating detection of diverse biologically relevant molecules.

Questions have arisen about whether the program can achieve its goals and obtain mutual benefits between Korea and participating nations. Using a total quality management (TQM) framework as a unique case analysis, we evaluated ITTP’s resources and performance from 2006 to 2014. Our results show that ITTP has focused on the quantitative promotion of students and alums from various countries and their learning of Korea-centric ICT, policies, and culture. In particular, the Korean government’s lax evaluation of ITTP performance has led to weak responsibility, ambiguous task identity, missed opportunities for self-improvement, and low participation among students and stakeholders. These findings highlight the need for graduate programs and their stakeholders to reinforce internal and external evaluations of the program’s performance and provide feedback for reciprocal development.}

This study investigates how PCE, conceptualised through the dimensions of language stylistics, personalisation, and labelling, affects UX outcomes, including performance, task management, and user satisfaction. The sample consisted of 294 respondents from China and Kenya. Using a user-centred approach, this study applies partial least squares structural equation modelling for empirical analysis. The results show that PCE significantly improves UX (β = 0.304, t = 3.965, p < 0.001) and acts as a proxy for implicit human feedback in LLM optimisation. Mediation analysis confirms that data management and prompting experience significantly explain the relationships (p < 0.001), whereas simple slope analysis supports the moderation effects of perceived usefulness, task fit, and quality. The findings suggest that user edits serve as fine-grained feedback signals that enhance personalisation and usability in academic contexts. These results inform the design of more flexible and feedback-aware LLM systems, thereby advancing the development of human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence.}

Current treatments for diabetic painful neuropathy often prove inadequate, necessitating the exploration of new pharmacological approaches. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential antinociceptive effect of aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4 (ATL), a specialized pro-resolving lipid mediator, when administered alone or in combination with cannabinoid agonists, to alleviate diabetic neuropathic pain. Mechanical hyperalgesia in the hindpaws of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic (DBT) rats was assessed using the electronic Von Frey test (VFT), before diabetes induction and for up to 32 days after STZ administration and intraperitoneal ATL (0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 ng/rat) treatment, alone or in combination with intrathecal CB1 or CB2 receptor agonists (ACEA or JWH-133, respectively; 10 or 30 μg/rat). The effect of ATL treatment on locomotor activity and anxious or depressive-like behaviors was also evaluated. In comparison to control normoglycemic rats, control DBT rats developed: 1) mechanical hyperalgesia; 2) increase in anxious and depressive-like behaviors. ATL treatment attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in DBT rats both acutely (at 30 ng) and cumulatively (at doses of 1, 3, 10, or 30 ng), without compromising locomotor activity. The antinociceptive effect of ATL (at 1 or 3 ng) was augmented when combined with ACEA or JWH-133 treatments (only at a dose of 30 μg/rat). While ATL treatment alone reduced anxious-like behavior in DBT rats, it did not affect depressive-like behavior. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of ATL, in diabetic complications, suggesting a possible interaction with the endocannabinoid system.}

This study employed data-driven analyses to explore how water quality change is affected by extreme drought-heatwave events, with a focus on identifying the key hydrometeorological drivers. The unprecedented extreme drought-heatwave event in China from March to December in 2022 provides an ideal case study. The spatiotemporal development was characterized by using meteorological drought index and drought centroid tracking, and the responses of nine water quality constituents to this event were quantified. Results revealed that the drought-heatwave was jointly driven by a significant decrease in precipitation (up to ∼50 % less than usual) and sustained high temperatures (∼2 °C above normal). Water quality deteriorated notably during this event, evidenced by ever-increased total nitrogen (TN) concentration (∼25 % to ∼30 % higher than non-drought period), higher TN extremes (27.5 mg/L), and decreased dissolved oxygen (DO) (∼−1.0 to ∼−0.5 mg/L lower than non-drought). Northern and central China particularly suffered from severe deterioration, concentrating 71 % of TN loads during the drought period, with a steeper TN load increase than in non-drought periods. Behind water quality degradation, air temperature emerged as the predominant driver of water quality deterioration, followed by streamflow and precipitation, with correlation coefficients (R) between temperature and TN/DO ranging from −0.74 to −0.59. This study revealed that extreme drought-heatwave event critically deteriorate river water quality in China, highlighting the urgent need for adaptive strategies to protect and restore water quality during extreme drought-heatwave events.}

ChatGPT is actively and widely adopted for academic applications, including tutoring, essay drafting, content clarification, and feedback generation. While its integration into educational settings offers numerous advantages, from enhancing learning outcomes and reducing test anxiety to fostering engagement and collaboration, it raises concerns regarding academic integrity, critical thinking, and over-reliance on AI-generated content. This paper presents a systematic review of existing literature on using ChatGPT in higher education, following a PRISMA-based methodology to analyze 39 studies published between 2023 and 2024. The review synthesizes findings across five key dimensions: academic performance, mental health, second-language learners, social influence, and inspiration. The results indicate that while ChatGPT improves accessibility to knowledge and provides cognitive and emotional support, its misuse may hinder independent learning and increase technostress. Furthermore, this review explores ethical and policy considerations surrounding ChatGPT's adoption, emphasizing the need for balanced integration strategies. Key recommendations include institutional guidelines, AI literacy initiatives, and frameworks for ethical integration. This review offers critical insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers seeking to navigate the evolving academic landscape shaped by AI.}

Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer potential solutions for addressing mental health care gaps, but often suffer from low engagement. Text messaging is one promising medium for increasing access and sustaining user engagement with DMHIs. This paper examines the Small Steps SMS program, an 8-week, automated, adaptive text message-based intervention for depression and anxiety.
Methods
We conducted an 8-week longitudinal usability test of the Small Steps SMS program, recruiting 20 participants who met criteria for major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. Participants used the automated intervention for 8 weeks and completed symptom severity and usability self-report surveys after 4 and 8 weeks of intervention use. Participants also completed individual interviews to provide feedback on the intervention.
Results
Participants responded to automated messages on 70 % of study days and with 85 % of participants sending responses to messages in the 8th week of use. Usability surpassed established cutoffs for software that is considered acceptable. Depression symptom severity decreased significantly over the usability test, but reductions in anxiety symptoms were not significant. Participants noted key areas for improvement including addressing message volume, aligning message scheduling to individuals' availability, and increasing the customizability of content.
Limitations
This study does not contain a control group.
Conclusions
An 8-week automated interactive text messaging intervention, Small Steps SMS, demonstrates promise with regard to being a feasible, usable, and engaging method to deliver daily mental health support to individuals with symptoms of anxiety and depression.}

From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements. It is concluded that the results are suggestive of the validity of the new scale and warrant further research.}

Methionine γ-lyase (MGL) is the key enzyme involved in the production of VSCs, such as methanethiol and ethanethiol, coinciding with the upregulation of durian MGL (DzMGL) during fruit ripening. Although the VSCs present in durian pulps have been extensively studied, the regulation of genes involved in VSC production in fruit has not yet been explored. Yeast one-hybrid screening of the promoter of durian MGL (pDzMGL) and ca. 1200 Arabidopsis transcription factors (TFs) together with a transcriptomics analysis identified candidate HD-ZIP TF families in durian. Here, dual-luciferase assays, in silico promoter analysis, and electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed to confirm the interaction between pDzMGL and DzHD-ZIP1.8. The results revealed that the ethylene-responsive DzHD-ZIP1.8 localized in the nucleus, where it functioned as an activator and bound to pDzMGL to control its expression during ripening. Therefore, a TF that regulates the expression of DzMGL in durian fruit during ripening was identified in this study. Moreover, this study elucidated the molecular regulation of an important gene involved in VSC production, which affects consumer preferences.}

Existing studies often fail to capture the structural characteristics of crop canopies, such as organ overlapping and resource competition. To address this issue, we propose a 3D maize modeling method based on computational intelligence. An initial 3D maize canopy is created using the t-distribution method to reflect characteristics of the plant architecture. The subsequent model considers the 3D phytomers of maize as intelligent agents. The aim is to maximize the ratio of sunlit leaf area, and by iteratively modifying the azimuth angle of the 3D phytomers, a 3D maize canopy model that maximizes light resource interception can be constructed. Additionally, the method incorporates a reflective approach to optimize the canopy and utilizes a mesh deformation technique for detecting and responding to leaf collisions within the canopy. Six canopy models of 2 varieties plus 3 planting densities was constructed for validation. The average R2 of the difference in azimuth angle between adjacent leaves is 0.71, with a canopy coverage error range of 7% to 17%. Another 3D maize canopy model constructed using 12 distinct density gradients demonstrates the proportion of leaves perpendicular to the row direction increases along with the density. The proportion of these leaves steadily increased after 9 × 104 plants ha−1. This study presents a 3D modeling method for the maize canopy. It is a beneficial exploration of swarm intelligence on crops and generates a new way for exploring efficient resources utilization of crop canopies.}

While studies have explored ChatGPT's usage, intention, and motivation, few have addressed its paradoxical use from a benefit-risk-coping perspective, leaving gaps in practical and theoretical solutions. This study integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to elucidate ChatGPT's paradoxical use in education. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), it aims to provide insights and solutions for managing the benefits, risks, and coping mechanisms associated with ChatGPT in education. Hypotheses and propositions were tested on Taiwanese higher education users (N = 351). Findings from SEM confirm that the perceived threat of ChatGPT's severity decreases the intention to use it, while coping strategies such as self-efficacy and response efficacy strongly predict the intention to use ChatGPT. Additionally, the benefits of performance expectancy and task efficiency significantly increase the intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn significantly increases actual usage behavior. Findings from fsQCA reveal three configurations for both the usage and disusage of ChatGPT in education. The study identifies three constructs with necessary conditions. This research makes a significant theoretical contribution by integrating UTAUT and PMT into a unified framework to elucidate the paradoxical aspects of benefit-risk-coping in the use of ChatGPT. Practical implications for higher educational institutions and their scholars (e.g., students, lecturers, researchers) are also provided through confirmed solutions from the QCA model. These solutions offer strategic insights to leverage the benefits, identify the risks, and cope with the threats associated with using ChatGPT in education.}

As the key advantage of the double-double composites is the reduced repeat number of sub-laminates necessary to achieve homogeneity, it is therefore crucial to determine the best pattern of sub-laminates which ensures the optimal lightweight design with the minimum thickness. In the data-driven framework, first, a generative neural network model was built for generating the sub-laminates fitting in the scope of the homogeneous criterion. Then, a symbolic regression model was built for quantitatively finding the hidden layup patterns in the dataset of these sub-laminates. It is found that the form of double-double and triple-double stands out in the vast design space of all the possible layup sequences. The 4-layer sub-laminate of [θ/−β/β/−θ] and 6-layer sub-laminate of [θ/−β/−γ/+γ/+β/−θ] are most recommended as they meet the homogeneous criterion with less thickness and offer larger design space of mechanical properties. The established data-driven framework can be extended to other scenarios especially in finding the common design rules of laminates.}

abstract = {Android-based In-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems generate log message containing valuable forensic artifacts from interactions with internal or external devices. These log messages can help in vehicle accidents or criminal investigations; however, there is limited knowledge of the stored information and the methods of accessing them. In addition, digital forensic analysis of the Android-based IVI systems is not supported by the popular forensic tool, Berla's iVe. To address this, we first acquire multiple types of logs from three Jellybean-based systems (2017-2019) and two KitKat-based IVI systems (2022-2023) using a practical and non-invasive method, and then perform a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the logging mechanisms in the IVI systems. We then examine volatile and nonvolatile log data acquired from the IVI systems from the perspective of vehicle forensics. Jellybean-based systems maintain seven ring buffers for volatile logs, while KitKat-based systems use five. Volatile logs are erased when the system is powered off. Both versions of the Android systems store nonvolatile log files of seven different types, with data retained for up to a year. We conducted a thorough analysis of the acquired logs, uncovering artifacts related to navigation use, radio listening, engine start/stop, door access, seat belt use, and Bluetooth connections, including phone calls and SMS messages. In addition, we compare the artifacts identified within those IVI systems. Finally, our analysis creates a timeline to track driver behavior, and provides critical insights into driver actions and vehicle events.}

abstract = {Drying is a crucial step for extending food shelf life and preserving quality attributes. However, traditional drying methods often compromise product quality and operational efficiency due to insufficient real-time monitoring and suboptimal control strategies. This review evaluated recent advancements in intelligent drying technologies. Deep learning (DL) collaborates with multidimensional perception systems to address nonlinear drying dynamics, enabling real-time quality monitoring and data-driven predictive modeling. Control strategies have evolved from the traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID), fuzzy logic control (FLC), and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to advanced adaptive control strategies that dynamically balance multiple objectives. Additionally, this review highlights the synergistic roles of DL-based intelligent drying technologies, including their integration with multi-dimensional sensing for robust data foundation, adaptive control for process optimization, and predictive modeling for nonlinear quality evolution. Challenges such as sensor environmental interference, high computational costs of spectroscopy, limited 3D phenotype monitoring, and DL's "black-box" nature were discussed, alongside emerging solutions: multi-scale data fusion to capture collaborative quality features, lightweight transfer learning for cross-food adaptability, and physics-informed DL architectures to enhance interpretability. The integration of digital twins and graph neural networks is emphasized as a frontier to reveal coupled heat-mass transfer, chemical reactions, and mechanical interactions underlying quality evolution. While progress has been made in improving efficiency and quality, persistent challenges remain in model generalization across diverse food types and drying conditions, computational complexity, and mechanistic interpretability. Future research should develop physics-data hybrid frameworks and multi-scale integration, driving the transition toward model-data dual-driven intelligent drying.}

In this changing scenario, this article reviews the literature on evolving criteria for quality assessment in secondary education using a four-step PRISMA flow chart for identification, screening, eligibility determination, and inclusion of data from the Scopus database and by employing quantitative and qualitative synthesis. The quantitative analysis found that Lim, W.M. is the eminent author; Quality Assurance in Education is the most popular journal; and the United States and the United Kingdom are the major contributing countries to this field. The evolving criteria for quality assessment in the rapidly emerging virtual and distance learning can be centred around five major themes: technological infrastructure, ICT competency, and adaptability, pedagogy for online education, collaboration, partnership, and motivation, as well as a blended learning environment. Thus, this study contributes to the existing theory by mapping the gaps and highlighting emerging themes for assessing education quality. This paper also supplies evidence to the educationists and policy-makers that help them formulate time-bound policy and to the researchers suggesting the need to develop valid and reliable measurement indicators for the evolving quality assessment criteria in the post-COVID era. This review has also proposed the future research agenda on applying generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) like ChatGPT, ChatSonic, Jasper Chat, and metaverse (Ready Player One, Roblox, and Facebook) technologies in secondary education for quality enhancement.}

This research dissects the application of GEO concrete as a high-temperature TES material, primarily focusing on its optimization and scalability. The introductory part of the study involves the development and validation of a three-dimensional numerical model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The model demonstrated an average accuracy rate of 5 %, as justified by empirical data. Later, a two-tiered investigation to determine the optimal design for GEO concrete TES systems was investigated. Three different geometries plus the impact of crucial parameters such as air velocity, tube diameter, and module size on the thermal storage capacity (Q) studied. It further extends into a parametric examination, exploring a variety of tube sizes, arrangements, and configurations. It is found that air velocity primarily influences Q. A subsequent phase provides an analysis of the thermodynamic effects brought by the inclusion of tubes within TES modules through an equivalent parametric study. It exposes the thermal resistance resulting from tube insertion. The study reinforces the superior thermal performance of tubeless GEO concrete TES configurations, as signified by overall heat transfer rate (Q̇). The study also signals the significant roles of key parameters in determining the temperature (T) and Q within TES unit using Pearson's correlation coefficient equation. As a final observation, this work emphasizes the sustained significance of on-site evaluations to consistently monitor the interplay between TES materials and high-temperature fluids (HTFs) over extended periods for viability analysis purposes.}

Study 2 applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore configurations of the driving factors that lead to high collaboration quality. Four distinct configurations emerged: 1) Domain knowledge, domestication ability, communication ability, and working memory; 2) Domain knowledge, domestication ability, working memory, and long-term memory; 3) Domain knowledge, communication ability, working memory, and long-term memory; and 4) Domain knowledge, ∼desire for control, domestication ability, communication ability, and long-term memory.

This paper aims to investigate the state-of-the-art explainable DD models across multiple modalities, including image, video, audio, and text. Unlike existing surveys that focus on detection methodologies with minimal attention to explainability and limited modality coverage, this paper directly focuses on these gaps. It offers a comprehensive analysis of advanced explainability techniques, including Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP, LRP, Saliency Maps, and Anchors, for detecting deceptive content across the modalities. It identifies the strengths and limitations of existing models and outlines research directions to enhance explainability and interpretability in future works. By exploring these models, we aim to enhance transparency, provide deeper insights into model decisions, and bridge the gap between detection accuracy with explainability in DD models.}

abstract = {Introduction
Acute rejection (AR) undermines the life-extending benefits of kidney transplantation and is diagnosed using the invasive biopsy procedure. T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), or concurrent TCMR + ABMR (Mixed Rejection [MR]) are the three major types of AR. Development of noninvasive biomarkers diagnostic of AR due to any of the three types is a useful addition to the diagnostic armamentarium.
Methods
We developed customized RT-qPCR assays and measured urinary cell mRNA copy numbers in 145 biopsy-matched urine samples from 126 kidney allograft recipients. We determined whether the urinary cell three-gene signature diagnostic of TCMR (Suthanthiran et al., 2013) discriminates patients with no rejection biopsies (NR, n = 50) from those with ABMR (n = 28) or MR (n = 20) biopsies.
Results
The urinary cell three-gene signature discriminated all three types of rejection biopsies from NR biopsies (P < 0.0001, One-way ANOVA). Dunnett's multiple comparisons test yielded P < 0.0001 for NR vs. TCMR; P < 0.001 for NR vs. ABMR; and P < 0.0001 for NR vs. MR. By bootstrap resampling, optimism-corrected area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.749 (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.638 to 0.840) for NR vs. TCMR (P < 0.0001); 0.780 (95% CI, 0.656 to 0.878) for NR vs. ABMR (P < 0.0001); and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.727 to 0.947) for NR vs. MR (P < 0.0001). All three rejection categories were distinguished from NR biopsies with similar accuracy (all AUC comparisons P > 0.05).
Conclusion
The urinary cell three-gene signature score discriminates AR due to TCMR, ABMR or MR from NR biopsies in human kidney allograft recipients.}

abstract = {Background
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data refer to information systematically reported by patients, or on behalf of patients, without the influence of health care professionals. It is a focal point of the health care system’s ambition toward becoming more involving and personalized. It is recognized that PROs provide valuable data. However, despite this recognition, there are challenges related to both patients’ and clinicians’ accurate interpretations of the quantitative data. To overcome these challenges, this study explores text vignettes as a representation of PROs.
Objective
This study aimed to develop data-informed text vignettes based on data from the Readiness and Enablement Index for Health Technology (READHY) instrument as another way of representing PRO data and to examine how these are perceived as understandable and relevant for both patients and clinicians.
Methods
The text vignettes were created from participant responses to the READHY instrument, which encompasses health literacy, health education, and eHealth literacy. The text vignettes were created from 13 individual text strings, each corresponding to a scale in the READHY instrument. This study consisted of 3 sequential parts. In part 1, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed the READHY instrument, providing data to be used to create vignettes based on cluster profiles from the READHY instrument. Part 2 focused on the development of scale-based strings representing all READHY dimensions, which were evaluated through iterative cognitive interviews. In part 3, clinicians and patients assessed the understanding and relevance of the text vignettes.
Results
Clinicians and patients both understood and related to the text vignettes. Patients viewed the text vignettes as an accurate reflection of their PRO responses, and clinicians perceived the text vignettes as aligned with their understanding of patients’ experiences.
Conclusions
Text vignettes can be developed using PRO instruments, with individual scales as input strings. This provides an opportunity to present numeric values in a text format that is understandable and recognizable to most patients and clinicians. Challenges with the vignette’s language and layout require customization and clinician training to ensure meaningful interpretation. Findings also support the need to expand the study and enhance clinical relevance with alternative or contextually relevant text vignettes.}

However, to effectively evaluate and validate these advancements, standardized testing methods are essential, extending beyond single-cell analysis to encompass stack-level characterization. This paper proposes comprehensive characterization methods tailored for analysis of electrolysis stacks and their performance characteristics. Each method is introduced with a focus on its practical applicability, accompanied by detailed procedural guidelines for implementation. Furthermore, variations within each method are discussed, offering possibilities for gathering additional insights. Presenting a portfolio of different methods, ranging from standard to advanced techniques applicable at the stack level, the paper showcases results obtained through their application. These results, normalized to cell area, demonstrate the significance of each method in obtaining stack characteristics crucial for informed design decisions on material selection and subsequent integration into electrolysis systems. By illustrating results derived from various stacks, this study contributes valuable insights for evaluating design, material suitability, and operational performance, thereby advancing the development and deployment of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis technology for sustainable hydrogen production.}

The findings revealed significant disparities between AI-generated and human-authored texts, with the AI-generated texts generally failing to exhibit resemblance to their human counterparts. Furthermore, a linear discriminant analysis, performed to measure the predictive potential of dimension scores for identifying the authorship of texts, demonstrated that AI-generated texts could be identified with relative ease based on their multidimensional profile. Collectively, the results underscore the current limitations of AI text generation in emulating natural human communication. This finding counters popular fears that AI will replace humans in textual communication. Rather, our findings suggest that, at present, AI's ability to capture the intricate patterns of natural language remains limited.}

The work employs Finite element analysis to measure the scaffolds' maximum principal and Von Mises stresses and strains. CT scans of the Maxilla and Mandible were used to apply load conditions to 3D models of the upper central incisor. In the derived computational model, four different load situations considered were: the masticatory load (70–100 N at 45°), two parafunctional habits (100–130 N) and 500–550 N at the incisal edge, both at 45°), and a trauma case (800–850 N applied perpendicularly from the inwards direction at 90°). The findings revealed that the central tooth region experiences the highest stress concentration, while the Maxilla and Mandible regions show the least stress. These results provide critical insights into the mechanical behavior of scaffolds at bone-tissue interfaces, suggesting a research direction for developing scaffolds that closely mimic real bone characteristics. The results of this study are particularly significant for using bone replacement materials, providing an approach to more effective healing options for bone traumas and degenerative bone disorders.}
