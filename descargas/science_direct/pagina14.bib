abstract = {Background
Prevention of suicide is a global health priority. Approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide yearly, and for every suicide death, there are another 20 estimated suicide attempts. Large language models (LLMs) hold the potential to enhance scalable, accessible, and affordable digital services for suicide prevention and self-harm interventions. However, their use also raises clinical and ethical questions that require careful consideration.
Objective
This scoping review aims to identify emergent trends in LLM applications in the field of suicide prevention and self-harm research. In addition, it summarizes key clinical and ethical considerations relevant to this nascent area of research.
Methods
Searches were conducted in 4 databases (PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore) in February 2024. Eligible studies described the application of LLMs for suicide or self-harm prevention, detection, or management. English-language peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings were included, without date restrictions. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize study characteristics, objectives, models, data sources, proposed clinical applications, and ethical considerations. This review adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) standards.
Results
Of the 533 studies identified, 36 (6.8%) met the inclusion criteria. An additional 7 studies were identified through citation chaining, resulting in 43 studies for review. The studies showed a bifurcation of publication fields, with varying publication norms between computer science and mental health. While most of the studies (33/43, 77%) focused on identifying suicide risk, newer applications leveraging generative functions (eg, support, education, and training) are emerging. Social media was the most common source of LLM training data. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was the predominant model used, although generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) featured prominently in generative applications. Clinical LLM applications were reported in 60% (26/43) of the studies, often for suicide risk detection or as clinical assistance tools. Ethical considerations were reported in 33% (14/43) of the studies, with privacy, confidentiality, and consent strongly represented.
Conclusions
This evolving research area, bridging computer science and mental health, demands a multidisciplinary approach. While open access models and datasets will likely shape the field of suicide prevention, documenting their limitations and potential biases is crucial. High-quality training data are essential for refining these models and mitigating unwanted biases. Policies that address ethical concerns—particularly those related to privacy and security when using social media data—are imperative. Limitations include high variability across disciplines in how LLMs and study methodology are reported. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence signals a shift in approach, particularly in applications related to care, support, and education, such as improved crisis care and gatekeeper training methods, clinician copilot models, and improved educational practices. Ongoing human oversight—through human-in-the-loop testing or expert external validation—is essential for responsible development and use.

abstract = {Background and objective(s)
Causal inference from observational studies is increasingly considered to evaluate treatment effects when randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are impractical, as it addresses confounding biases inherent in non-randomized data. Methods such as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) are widely employed to mitigate these biases. However, IPTW often faces challenges, including issues with extreme weights, sensitivity to unmeasured confounding, and large sample size requirements. Recent advances in neural networks have demonstrated the potential to generate realistic synthetic data that replicate the statistical properties of real-world data. These advances may enhance traditional causal inference methods by creating counterfactual populations. However, the use of synthetic data in causal inference remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the adequacy of synthetic data generation for creating counterfactual populations and to compare its performance with IPTW. This approach was applied to evaluate the effect of early prone position on 28-day mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients.
Material and Methods
We conducted a simulation study with 2,000 observations, considering a treatment and a binary outcome influenced by confounding factors. Three methods were used to generate datasets of 50,000 synthetic observations: Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), Realistic Relational and Tabular Data using Transformers (REaLTabFormer), and simpler regression models. Observations with similar propensity scores were sampled from the synthetic dataset to create counterfactual populations, with sample sizes corresponding to inverse probability of treatment weights. The treatment effect was estimated using univariable logistic regression and compared to the true simulated effect. These methods were applied to electronic health records (EHRs) from the “Assistance publique–Hôpitaux de Paris” data warehouse, focusing on COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation within 48 hours of admission.
Results
Both REaLTabFormer and regression methods achieved performance broadly similar to that obtained using only the original data with IPTW. CTGAN exhibited higher biases, larger standard errors, and higher type I and type II error rates. The application of these methods to real-world EHR data from mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients demonstrated the high quality of data generated by the models, with joint distributions of variables closely mimicking those of the original datasets. None of the evaluated methods identified an effect of early prone position on 28-day mortality.
Conclusion
This study highlights the potential of synthetic data generation for creating counterfactual populations, thereby addressing some of the limitations of IPTW. While the evaluated frameworks provided estimates that were at best similar to IPTW, further research is needed in scenarios where IPTW may encounter more limitations, such as small sample sizes or larger numbers of confounding factors. These findings underline both the promise and the challenges of integrating synthetic data into causal inference methods.}

The data in these documents must be converted into digital forms other automated systems could only process. One generic use case is document classification, which usually involves manual transformation due to human understanding needed in the process. These documents go beyond those generated through regular business transactions and operations and also include web-based content such as online news, blogs, e-mails, and various digital libraries. Recent developments in robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI) aim to automate the otherwise expensive, time-consuming, and repetitive manual steps. Through more powerful natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities, large language models (LLMs) may come as a big boost in applying AI to RPA initiatives. This study proposes a general approach to using LLMs as document classifier co-pilots for knowledge workers in charge of classifying documents to be useful. The manner of prompt engineering and refinement involving labeled health insurance documents to achieve better results is discussed and evaluated through early, iterative classification attempts. However, early tests with a complex sample use case show unsatisfactory results. The study ends with recommendations for future work to improve precision and recall performance.}

Eleven culturally diverse students from two high schools in Hong Kong participated in the study. The study developed and employed a novel pedagogical framework, IDEA (Interpret, Design, Evaluate, and Articulate), to seamlessly incorporate generative AI into DMC practices. Data-collection methods included analysis of generative AI tool-usage history, classroom video observations, surveys, and interviews. The findings reveal that students leveraged generative AI’s capabilities across five key areas: content generation, feedback and revision, multilingual support, critical thinking, and visual representation. The integration of AI tools followed distinct stages in the composition process, resulting in enhancements to the vocabulary, grammar, and structural elements of students’ work. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the intersection of generative AI, education, and multimodal literacy, with a particular emphasis on human-AI collaboration in multicultural settings.

abstract = {Purpose
There is no “Gold Standard” test that allows the diagnosis and classification of alterations and pathologies related to Meibomian glands (MG). A global evaluation of objective and subjective tests is necessary to determine the final diagnosis. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have experienced great progress in the field of health sciences, as promising techniques for predicting pathologies from data and images. The main objective of this study has been to train ML classifiers for the classification of three groups of participants with and without MG alterations. The secondary objective was to study the precision, specificity and sensitivity of the ML classifiers.
Methods
A retrospective comparative study was carried out on a total of 135 participants (control, contact lens wearers and MG pathology). Symptomatology and clinical tests were performed to evaluate the ocular surface and adnexa. The numerical data obtained from these tests were used to train ML classifiers and the top 5 were subsequently verified.
Results
Accuracies greater than 76 % were obtained for the training group and greater than 79 % for the verification group, for five classifiers previously described in Matlab. Subspace KNN was the classifier with the highest accuracies, specificities and sensitivities, these being moderate-high (greater than 79 %).
Conclusions
ML algorithms can be useful for classifying groups of participants with various meibomian gland disorders using clinical data. A large number of participants is needed for reliable diagnostic accuracy.}

Drawing upon foundational teamwork literature and AI literacy frameworks, we conducted a multi-method investigation involving 116 undergraduate team members across 23 project teams throughout a semester. In Study 1, qualitative findings revealed distinct attitudes toward GAI as a teammate, categorized as trust, distrust, and ambivalence. Study 2 employed quantitative methods to determine predictors of trust in GAI, demonstrating that AI knowledge and perceived value—key components of AI literacy—significantly influenced perceptions of trust. Notably, perceptions of GAI accuracy emerged as a critical determinant of trust. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between AI literacy and trust in human-GAI collaboration. We observed a paradox: increased AI literacy can enhance collaboration but may also lead to hesitancy in future AI use. We contribute to advancing the understanding of human-AI collaboration by highlighting the critical role of AI literacy in shaping trust and socio-technical team dynamics. Our study provides evidence demonstrating the importance of targeted AI literacy development in building trust and fostering effective collaboration in human-GAI teams.

abstract = {Background
In the evolving field of health care, multimodal generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as ChatGPT-4 with vision (ChatGPT-4V), represent a significant advancement, as they integrate visual data with text data. This integration has the potential to revolutionize clinical diagnostics by offering more comprehensive analysis capabilities. However, the impact on diagnostic accuracy of using image data to augment ChatGPT-4 remains unclear.
Objective
This study aims to assess the impact of adding image data on ChatGPT-4’s diagnostic accuracy and provide insights into how image data integration can enhance the accuracy of multimodal AI in medical diagnostics. Specifically, this study endeavored to compare the diagnostic accuracy between ChatGPT-4V, which processed both text and image data, and its counterpart, ChatGPT-4, which only uses text data.
Methods
We identified a total of 557 case reports published in the American Journal of Case Reports from January 2022 to March 2023. After excluding cases that were nondiagnostic, pediatric, and lacking image data, we included 363 case descriptions with their final diagnoses and associated images. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of ChatGPT-4V and ChatGPT-4 without vision based on their ability to include the final diagnoses within differential diagnosis lists. Two independent physicians evaluated their accuracy, with a third resolving any discrepancies, ensuring a rigorous and objective analysis.
Results
The integration of image data into ChatGPT-4V did not significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy, showing that final diagnoses were included in the top 10 differential diagnosis lists at a rate of 85.1% (n=309), comparable to the rate of 87.9% (n=319) for the text-only version (P=.33). Notably, ChatGPT-4V’s performance in correctly identifying the top diagnosis was inferior, at 44.4% (n=161), compared with 55.9% (n=203) for the text-only version (P=.002, χ2 test). Additionally, ChatGPT-4’s self-reports showed that image data accounted for 30% of the weight in developing the differential diagnosis lists in more than half of cases.
Conclusions
Our findings reveal that currently, ChatGPT-4V predominantly relies on textual data, limiting its ability to fully use the diagnostic potential of visual information. This study underscores the need for further development of multimodal generative AI systems to effectively integrate and use clinical image data. Enhancing the diagnostic performance of such AI systems through improved multimodal data integration could significantly benefit patient care by providing more accurate and comprehensive diagnostic insights. Future research should focus on overcoming these limitations, paving the way for the practical application of advanced AI in medicine.}

The perception of ChatGPT involves a student's understanding of, willingness to utilize, and concerns regarding the technology. These interconnected factors can influence students' online learning engagement with the software and, consequently, affect their academic performance. The study used self-reported data from 305 participants at a large university in Iran. The findings from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that students' perception of ChatGPT accounts for 19.2 % of the variance in online learning engagement, while the combination of ChatGPT perception and online learning engagement explains 40.4 % of the variance in academic performance. Furthermore, students' perceptions of ChatGPT had direct effects on online learning engagement (β = 0.438) and academic performance (β = 0.268). Additionally, online engagement significantly mediated this relationship, with an indirect effect of β = 0.206. The observed direct and indirect effects highlighted the essential role of online learning engagement in fostering interaction and enhancing students' performance. Overall, our conceptual model provides researchers and university administrators with a comprehensive understanding of students' perceptions of ChatGPT, their engagement, and their academic performance in an online setting.

Traditional endoscopic methods for removing friable boluses, such as meat, are often time-intensive and challenging. This report explores the novel application of cryoadhesion, or freezing and adhering an object to a cryoprobe, for esophageal meat bolus extraction. A 25-year-old man with trisomy 21 and eosinophilic esophagitis presented with acute food bolus impaction. After unsuccessful conventional endoscopic maneuvers, a cryoprobe was externally attached to an endoscope and used to achieve cryoadhesion and extraction of the meat bolus. Within 10 minutes, the meat bolus was successfully removed attached to the cryoprobe without mucosal injury. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged the next day without adverse events. Cryoadhesion via a flexible cryoprobe may offer a feasible alternative for removing challenging food impactions. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate its safety and efficacy.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
By reducing some magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, abbreviated MRI (aMRI) has shown extensive promise for detecting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aim to develop deep learning (DL)-based gadolinium-free contrast-enhanced (CE) aMRI protocols (DL-aMRI) for detecting HCC.
Methods
In total, 1,769 patients (913 with HCC) were retrospectively included from three institutions for training, testing, and external validation. Stable diffusion-based DL models were trained to generate CE-MRI, including T1-weighted arterial, portal venous, transitional, and hepatobiliary phase images (AP-syn, VP-syn, TP-syn, and HBP-syn, respectively). Non-contrast-MRI (NC-MRI), including T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and pre-contrast T1-weighted (Pre) sequences, along with either actual or DL-synthesized CE-MRI (AP, VP, TP, and HBP or AP-syn, VP-syn, TP-syn, and HBP-syn), were used to create conventional complete MRI (cMRI) and DL-aMRI protocols. An inter-method comparison of image quality between DL-aMRI and cMRI was conducted using a non-inferiority test. The sensitivity and specificity of DL-aMRI and cMRI for detecting HCC were statistically compared using the non-inferiority test and generalized estimating equations models.
Results
DL-aMRI showed a remarkable reduction in acquisition time compared with cMRI (4.1 vs. 28.1 min). The image quality of DL-synthesized CE-MRI was not inferior to that of actual CE-MRI (p <0.001). There was an excellent inter-method agreement between the HCC sizes measured by the two protocols (R2 = 0.9436–0.9683). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of cMRI and DL-aMRI were 0.899 and 0.925 and 0.866 and 0.922, respectively. No significant differences were found between the sensitivity and specificity of the two protocols.
Conclusions
The proposed DL-aMRI could facilitate precise HCC diagnosis with no need for contrast agents, a substantial reduction in acquisition time, and preservation of both NC-MRI and CE-MRI data. DL-aMRI may serve as a valuable tool for HCC diagnosing.
Impact and implications
In this multi-center study involving 1,769 participants, we developed a generative deep learning-based abbreviated MRI (DL-aMRI) strategy that provides an efficient, contrast-agent-free alternative for detecting HCC with accuracy comparable to that of conventional complete MRI, significantly reducing acquisition time from 28.1 min to just 4.1 min. This strategy is valuable for clinicians who face significant workloads resulting from long MRI scanning times and the potential adverse effects of contrast agents, as well as for researchers focused on developing cost-effective and accessible diagnostic tools for HCC detection. The proposed DL-aMRI protocol has practical implications for clinical settings, enhancing diagnostic efficiency while maintaining high image quality, eliminating the need for contrast agents and ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare providers.}

abstract = {Generative models represent a pivotal innovation in machine learning, particularly impacting image Classification through synthetic data generation. These models enhance training datasets by introducing greater diversity and robustness, improving the predictive accuracy of Classification algorithms. Among the best methods, generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and probabilistic graph models stand out for their complex structures and wide range of uses, from medical imaging to self-driving cars. Despite their advantages, these models present distinct challenges. GANs often suffer from mode collapse, where the model fails to capture the diversity of the input data. Diffusion models require extensive computational resources, limiting their practicality for real-time applications. Probabilistic graph models, while powerful, involve complex implementation procedures that can impede their use in scalable solutions. Moreover, issues such as limited interpretability and ethical concerns further restrict the broader deployment of these technologies. This paper aims to address these challenges by analyzing these generative models’ architecture, efficacy, and application areas and critically examining their limitations. Our work contributes to the ongoing discourse by proposing research directions to improve model transparency and computational efficiency, stabilize training processes, and integrate ethical considerations into model development. The ultimate aim is to harness the full potential of generative models in critical application areas by mitigating their current limitations. By advancing research in these directions, we can better leverage these powerful tools for applications demanding high precision and reliability, such as in medical diagnostics, precision agriculture, and the development of robust autonomous systems.}

Through a prospective approach and an exhaustive review of the scientific literature, the study examines how AI can transform the management of educational institutions by optimizing decision-making processes, enhancing administrative efficiency, and personalizing educational pathways through the analysis of large datasets. However, the intrinsic limitations of AI are highlighted, notably its inability to replicate essential human competencies such as empathy, intuition, inspiring leadership, and nuanced understanding of human interactions. Consequently, a hybrid leadership model is proposed, where AI acts as a high-performing assistant for routine tasks, while human educational directors focus on strategic and relational aspects. Thus, although AI offers significant advantages for educational management, it cannot entirely substitute for the indispensable role of the human educational director.}

Researchers must understand the strategic concerns of non-sellers of NFTs before theorising about long-term implementation, diffusion, and adoption. An exploratory case study of non-selling content creators is employed in this study. The findings of this study reveal that resistance to NFT sales is influenced by several factors including external influences, initial conditions, social responsibility beliefs and individual values. Whilst a lot of research has examined the positive associations with NFT (e.g. motivations to buy) this paper focuses on resistance from a seller's perspective. It further provides a foundation for understanding resistance from individuals who are self-employed and thus sheds new insights for this domain.}

We present learning activities that introduce 38 middle-school students to generative modeling, how it is used to generate Deepfakes, cues that help to recognize Deepfakes, and the spread and effects of misinformation. Students demonstrated an understanding that generative media may be believable, but not necessarily true, and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. They were also able to identify why misinformation may be harmful or lasting, drawing specific examples to social settings that indicate human-centered implications. Finally, students expressed opinions about policies surrounding the presence of Deepfakes on social media. This approach can be adopted to introduce students to other technical systems that constitute both productive applications and potential negative implications of technology.

Artificial intelligence (AI)- powered chatbots have provided some notable benefits for learners. Educators are beginning to explore their possible utility and find ways to leverage AI in their classrooms.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of ChatGPT-generated social determinants of health (SDOH) activity in a team-based pharmacy education course.
Methods
Instructors asked the software to generate a set of learning objectives, an in-class activity, assessment strategies, and summative assessments for a student's conceptual understanding of SDOH. During a required first-year, team-based pharmacy course at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, participants (n = 95) completed a ChatGPT-generated, in-class activity on SDOH within groups. The students' views on the quality of the activity were evaluated using five Likert-scale questions. Four of the questions assessed the applicability and usefulness of the assignment, with rankings on a scale of 1–4 (1 = strongly disagree; 4 = strongly agree). The fifth question evaluated the quality of the activity compared to activities generated by the instructor, using a scale of 1–5 (1 = far worse; 5 = far better).
Results
For applicability and usefulness,”94.7 % (n = 90) of students agreed that “This in-class exercise was valuable to my professional development as a pharmacist;” 96.8 % (n = 92) agreed with “It is necessary for pharmacists to understand SDOH;” 94.7 % (n = 90) agreement with the statement, “The quality of this in-class activity was on-par with other in-class activities in the course;” and 90.5 % (n = 86) agreed with “This in-class exercise was just as impactful to my professional development as other in-class activities.” The majority of students (63.2 %; n = 60) selected either “somewhat better” (40 %; n = 38) or far better (23.2 %; n = 22) for, “Regarding quality, I feel the in-class activity was ____ than other in-class activities.”
Conclusions
Most students reported that the ChatGPT-generated activity on social determinants of health was useful, applicable, and somewhat or far better than instructor activities. However, AI can generate incorrect information and potentially hinder student learning of conceptual frameworks; thus, instructors should review all output carefully.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in mental health, showing promise in assessing disorders. However, concerns exist regarding their accuracy, reliability, and fairness. Societal biases and underrepresentation of certain populations may impact LLMs. Because LLMs are already used for clinical practice, including decision support, it is important to investigate potential biases to ensure a responsible use of LLMs. Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) show a lifetime prevalence of 1%‐2%, affecting more women than men. Among men, homosexual men face a higher risk of eating disorders (EDs) than heterosexual men. However, men are underrepresented in ED research, and studies on gender, sexual orientation, and their impact on AN and BN prevalence, symptoms, and treatment outcomes remain limited.
Objectives
We aimed to estimate the presence and size of bias related to gender and sexual orientation produced by a common LLM as well as a smaller LLM specifically trained for mental health analyses, exemplified in the context of ED symptomatology and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with AN or BN.
Methods
We extracted 30 case vignettes (22 AN and 8 BN) from scientific papers. We adapted each vignette to create 4 versions, describing a female versus male patient living with their female versus male partner (2 × 2 design), yielding 120 vignettes. We then fed each vignette into ChatGPT-4 and to “MentaLLaMA” based on the Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) architecture thrice with the instruction to evaluate them by providing responses to 2 psychometric instruments, the RAND-36 questionnaire assessing HRQoL and the eating disorder examination questionnaire. With the resulting LLM-generated scores, we calculated multilevel models with a random intercept for gender and sexual orientation (accounting for within-vignette variance), nested in vignettes (accounting for between-vignette variance).
Results
In ChatGPT-4, the multilevel model with 360 observations indicated a significant association with gender for the RAND-36 mental composite summary (conditional means: 12.8 for male and 15.1 for female cases; 95% CI of the effect –6.15 to −0.35; P=.04) but neither with sexual orientation (P=.71) nor with an interaction effect (P=.37). We found no indications for main effects of gender (conditional means: 5.65 for male and 5.61 for female cases; 95% CI –0.10 to 0.14; P=.88), sexual orientation (conditional means: 5.63 for heterosexual and 5.62 for homosexual cases; 95% CI –0.14 to 0.09; P=.67), or for an interaction effect (P=.61, 95% CI –0.11 to 0.19) for the eating disorder examination questionnaire overall score (conditional means 5.59‐5.65 95% CIs 5.45 to 5.7). MentaLLaMA did not yield reliable results.
Conclusions
LLM-generated mental HRQoL estimates for AN and BN case vignettes may be biased by gender, with male cases scoring lower despite no real-world evidence supporting this pattern. This highlights the risk of bias in generative artificial intelligence in the field of mental health. Understanding and mitigating biases related to gender and other factors, such as ethnicity, and socioeconomic status are crucial for responsible use in diagnostics and treatment recommendations.}

Artificial Intelligence AI is increasingly becoming a foundation of competitive planning for contemporary organizations. However, even though the implementation of AI in organizations is a critical intervention that can unlock new forms of value, many of these implementations do not meet the expected outcomes. They may result in substantial financial, operational, and reputational negative consequences. This systematic literature review starts with a sample of 3104 articles from well-reputed journals published between 2010-2024. It aims to examine several questions that surround the occurrence of AI failure in organizations: the reasons behind those failures, the categories of the failures, and the disciplinary areas of the failures. Moreover, customers', employees', and management's points of view are considered in the review to extrapolate the potential consequences of the failure of AI systems. The result demonstrates that the AI breakdown often results from a mixture of technology, organization, and people problems and that different industries exhibit diverce types of failures.}

Ovarian steroid cell tumors not otherwise specified (OSCT-NOS) are extremely rare ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, accounting for <0.1 % of all ovarian tumors. In 25 % of cases, they are asymptomatic leading to a delay in diagnosis. We, herein, report a singular case of OSCT-NOS diagnosed incidentally during the spread assessment of an invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (IBC-NOS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of co-occurrence of OSCT-NOS and IBC-NOS. We aim to study the clinic-pathological characteristics of this rare tumor.
Case presentation
A 56-years old postmenopausal female, with no previous medical history, was diagnosed with an invasive IBC-NOS. The tomography performed during the spread assessment of IBC-NOS showed a suspicious mass of the right ovary. Pelvic MRI revealed an ovarian solid T1 isointense and T2 hyperintense mass. The first evoked diagnosis was an ovarian metastasis of the IBC-NOS. The patient underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. On gross examination, an ovarian solid mass measuring 2,5x2cm, with a firm gray yellowish cut surface was noted. Microscopic examination and immunostaining concluded to OSCT-NOS and ruled out the diagnosis of an ovarian metastasis of IBC-NOS.
Conclusion
OSCT-NOS are rare neoplasms. Their diagnosis might be challenging especially in absence of hormonal symptoms. A better knowledge of this rare entities would enable early diagnosis.}

BACKGROUND
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine has increased dramatically. Its utilization will expand in cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, altering current practice. We surveyed CT surgeons to gain insight into their beliefs, hopes, and fears regarding AI.
METHODS
A 25-question instrument addressing AI use in CT surgery was created, focusing on the domains of role, value, effect, threat, and regulation of AI. In coordination with several cardiothoracic surgical societies, the survey was electronically distributed to and completed by the societies’ members. After filtering, 424 complete de-identified responses were collected and analyzed. Answers were scored on a Likert scale and collapsed into categories for analysis.
RESULTS
There was a broad range of responses that varied from very negative to very positive. Most statistically significant differences in responses among demographics primarily related to the role and value of AI in clinical care areas. Specifically, female surgeons, younger surgeons, and thoracic (as opposed to cardiac) surgeons envisioned a smaller role for AI. Physicians felt that regulation of AI should come from professional societies and federal governments, and supported a proactive approach to the integration of AI into CT surgery, including engagement with industry and sharing of specialty specific texts and databases.
CONCLUSIONS
As AI is further implemented in medicine, CT surgery faces a rapidly changing landscape. Expectedly, feelings among physicians are mixed. However, there are clear areas of agreement as to the benefit of AI integration and broad support for proactive approaches to integration.}

Chest wall tumors are common and predominantly benign. Exceptionally, long-standing evolution over decades can lead to the development of giant tumors, posing substantial technical and strategic challenges in determining the optimal surgical approach.
Presentation of case
We report a rare case of a giant pedunculated chest wall lipoma that had been growing for over 40 years in a 73-year-old man. CT scan revealed a mass with a 5 cm-suprascapular-implantation base, hanging posteriorly and mimicking a pseudo-limb, measuring 17 × 7 cm in diameter and 34 cm in length. Complete surgical resection was performed, and histopathology confirmed a benign lipoma with no signs of malignancy.
Clinical discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a huge lipoma with more than 40 years of evolution and an unusual pedunculated presentation resembling a third upper limb.
Conclusion
This case is exceptional due to its pedunculated appearance resembling an additional limb, and a slow evolution over more than 40 years. Complete surgical resection ensures a favorable prognosis.}

According to Schneider et al (2021), the perception on COVID-19 risk needs to be assessed longitudinally to understand its persistence and predictors. This stability of this perception helps in designing communication strategies, especially during a pandemic.
Aims
This study aimed to evaluate changes in of Indonesians' risk perceptions toward COVID-19 over a three-year period (2020–2022) and factors associated with the changes.
Methods
A standardized, self-directed online questionnaire developed by Effective Communications in Outbreak Management for Europe was used to assess risk perception and its associated variables.
Results
A total of 2,708 people participated in the survey, which comprised 1,043 participants in 2020, 890 in 2021, and 775 in 2022. Analysis of variance and Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post hoc analysis revealed that risk perception of COVID-19 significantly declined in 2022 compared to previous years. At the same time, risk tolerance—such as readiness, ability to control risk, belief in efficacy, and willingness to implement control measures—peaked. Personal responsibility for protecting one's own health and preventing harm to others was reported as key driver for implementing control measures. Linear regression analysis shows that the sociodemographic variables, namely sex and occupation, consistently influenced risk perception throughout the three-year study (p < 0.05).
Conclusion
Therefore, it is essential to develop a tailored communication strategy for different sexes and occupations.}

abstract = {Introduction
The intrahepatic location of the gallbladder is one of the most common ectopic locations of the gallbladder. An intrahepatic gallbladder often exhibits impaired function, which may lead to stasis and gallstone formation. Given the surgical complexities associated with this ectopic location, the traditional open approach is usually employed.
Case report
The authors report the case of a 52-year-old female patient who consulted for pain in the right hypochondrium. Physical examination revealed only right upper quadrant pain on palpation. Abdominal ultrasound revealed gallbladder lithiasis without indicating the presence of an anatomical anomaly. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in the “French position” with 4 trocars. During surgery, we discovered an intrahepatic gallbladder. Subserosal dissection of the gallbladder was done without having to perform a hepatotomy. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 without any complications.
Discussion
Intra hepatic location of gallbladder is rare and can be detected by ultrasound or CT scan but in our study, it has not been detected by ultrasound before operation. Laparoscopic approach for a gallstone within ectopic gallbladder is rarely described in literature because cholecystectomy by conventional route is preferred when this anomaly is known and mostly when gallbladder is completely embedded within the liver.
Conclusion
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the gold standard for a partial intrahepatic gallbladder.}

abstract = {Purpose/Objective(s)
Generative artificial intelligence (AI)–especially large language models (LLMs)–promises to make a profound impact on providers’ productivity and wellness. Algorithmic benchmarks make impressive claims like LLMs having superior bedside manner and diagnostic abilities than providers. But how useful are LLMs for typical tasks in radiation oncology? Do LLMs save time or cognitive burden? How does it impact provider frustration?
Materials/Methods
Using a scenario-based design with a multidisciplinary team (radiation oncologists (RO), AI researcher, and medical physicist) we created four ecologically-situated tasks that would be helpful to an RO– medical decision making (MDM), letter of medical necessity (LOMN), summary of a consult note, summary of a radiology note). Using a diary study method with standardized prompts, we prompted three publicly available LLMs (Bard, BingChat, ChatGPT) for all use cases. The prompts contained deidentified text from patient notes, case details, and radiology reports. All LLMs were prompted on the same date and multiple points across multiple dates to avoid model update confounds. Using an iterative inductive qualitative coding process, we assessed each use case for perceived usefulness according to themes including accuracy, breadth of response, consistency, efficiency, cognitive burden, and frustration.
Results
Across use cases, while LLMs usually produced outputs, the quality of the output, especially for MDM, added more complexity and frustration. Time spent checking for hallucinations increased the overall burden. While LLMs performed well for summarization tasks and produced moderately useful LOMN, efficiency was offset by time required to review output. MDM output lacked breadth of treatment options but also failed to provide patient-specific recommendations. Table 1 summarizes findings. * Prompt character count exceeded † LLM initially refused but later complied after prompt injection.
Conclusion
In four ecology-situated scenarios investigated, utility of LLMs fell below expectations. While summarization tasks were well-performed, cases where the assistance is most useful–such as medical decision-making– the LLMs performed the worst by including overly generalized guidance and hallucinations. This added to the RO’s cognitive burden and frustration. Gains in efficiency where LLMs successfully summarized technical text may be obviated by liability concerns.}

abstract = {Introduction and importance
Large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the colon (LCNECC) are exceptionally rare, comprising only 0.2 % of all colonic carcinomas. Their diagnosis poses a significant challenge due to their propensity to mimic colonic adenocarcinomas. Typically diagnosed at advanced stages, LCNECCs carry a grim prognosis. Herein, we present a rare case of LCNECC and aim to elucidate its clinico-pathological characteristics.
Case presentation
A 56-year-old female patient presented with complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, and weight loss. On physical examination, a sizable mass was palpable in the right flank. Colonoscopy revealed a polyp in the descending colon and a friable multinodular stenosing mass in the ascending colon. Microscopic examination of the biopsy from the ascending colon mass exhibited a poorly differentiated large cell carcinomatous proliferation with positivity for synaptophysin and CD56, along with a Ki-67 proliferation index of 50 %. The polyp in the descending colon was consistent with a low-grade dysplastic tubular adenoma. A diagnosis of LCNECC with synchronous low-grade dysplastic tubular adenoma was established. A right hemicoloctomy was performed. Final pathological examination confirmed LCNECC invading the muscularis propria, with lymph node metastases. The tumor was classified as pT2N1M0 (Stage III).
Clinical discussion
LCNECCs often mimic adenocarcinomas clinically, endoscopically, and radiologically. Pathological examination is the key for diagnosis. An immunohistochemical study using neuroendocrine markers is imperative to prevent overlooking the diagnosis of LCNECC.
Conclusion
LCNECCs represent rare aggressive carcinomas. Their diagnosis might be challenging. A better knowledge of this rare entities would enable early diagnosis.}

By combining quantitative statistics (structured data such as activity name, sponsor, audience characteristics, and organizational form) with qualitative analysis (text mining of lecture training content), the current status of AI literacy lecture training in their university libraries is systematically examined. The study found that China’s “Double First-Class” university libraries have the following prominent problems in AI literacy lecture training: the degree of attention and implementation strength are different, the participation of librarians is low, lecture training mainly relies on teachers outside the library, the lecture training content is unbalanced, there is a lack of AI cognition and AI ethics, AI lecture training lacks systematicness, and AI skills education is out of touch with practical applications. Based on an international comparative perspective, the paper proposes eight optimization strategies: Strengthen the emphasis and implementation of AI literacy lecture training, provide continuous AI literacy lecture training for librarians and strengthen the construction of AI-Literate librarians, improve AI lecture training content and strengthen AI cognition and AI ethics education, establishing the AI workshop series: achieving systematic and comprehensive craining, increase AI practice components, holding GenAI research cafe, and cooperate with multiple institutions to organize AI lecture training, in order to provide practical reference for the innovative development of AI literacy education system in university libraries around the world.}

abstract = {Background
Although patients have easy access to their electronic health records and laboratory test result data through patient portals, laboratory test results are often confusing and hard to understand. Many patients turn to web-based forums or question-and-answer (Q&A) sites to seek advice from their peers. The quality of answers from social Q&A sites on health-related questions varies significantly, and not all responses are accurate or reliable. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have opened a promising avenue for patients to have their questions answered.
Objective
We aimed to assess the feasibility of using LLMs to generate relevant, accurate, helpful, and unharmful responses to laboratory test–related questions asked by patients and identify potential issues that can be mitigated using augmentation approaches.
Methods
We collected laboratory test result–related Q&A data from Yahoo! Answers and selected 53 Q&A pairs for this study. Using the LangChain framework and ChatGPT web portal, we generated responses to the 53 questions from 5 LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, LLaMA 2, MedAlpaca, and ORCA_mini. We assessed the similarity of their answers using standard Q&A similarity-based evaluation metrics, including Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score. We used an LLM-based evaluator to judge whether a target model had higher quality in terms of relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety than the baseline model. We performed a manual evaluation with medical experts for all the responses to 7 selected questions on the same 4 aspects.
Results
Regarding the similarity of the responses from 4 LLMs; the GPT-4 output was used as the reference answer, the responses from GPT-3.5 were the most similar, followed by those from LLaMA 2, ORCA_mini, and MedAlpaca. Human answers from Yahoo data were scored the lowest and, thus, as the least similar to GPT-4–generated answers. The results of the win rate and medical expert evaluation both showed that GPT-4’s responses achieved better scores than all the other LLM responses and human responses on all 4 aspects (relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety). LLM responses occasionally also suffered from lack of interpretation in one’s medical context, incorrect statements, and lack of references.
Conclusions
By evaluating LLMs in generating responses to patients’ laboratory test result–related questions, we found that, compared to other 4 LLMs and human answers from a Q&A website, GPT-4’s responses were more accurate, helpful, relevant, and safer. There were cases in which GPT-4 responses were inaccurate and not individualized. We identified a number of ways to improve the quality of LLM responses, including prompt engineering, prompt augmentation, retrieval-augmented generation, and response evaluation.}

abstract = {Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, and the ability to predict PPH may help address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality such as delays in care. Understanding the importance of standardized approaches to PPH, the National Partnership for Maternal Safety Consensus Bundle on Obstetric Hemorrhage outlines four critical domains for safe and effective PPH care: 1) Readiness; 2) Recognition and Prevention; 3) Response; and 4) Reporting and System Learning. The Recognition and Prevention domain includes recommendations for standardized methods of PPH risk prediction, and The Joint Commission now requires use of an evidence-based PPH prediction tool. Postpartum hemorrhage risk predictions can be accomplished via checklist tools completed manually by healthcare providers or via machine-assisted calculations in the form of logistic regression or machine learning populated by automated electronic health record data. The latter examples of machine-assisted calculations of PPH risk are a form of artificial intelligence. The purpose of this review is to describe the current state of AI-based PPH risk assessment, including the application of logistic regression and machine learning. A primer on interpretation of such models is provided, along with identification of research gaps and future directions.}

Although electronic health record (EHR) data can fill evidence gaps and improve decisions, several important limitations can affect its validity and relevance. The ISPOR framework includes 2 components: data delineation and data fitness for purpose. Data delineation provides a complete understanding of the data and an assessment of its trustworthiness by describing (1) data characteristics; (2) data provenance; and (3) data governance. Fitness for purpose comprises (1) data reliability items, ie, how accurate and complete the estimates are for answering the question at hand and (2) data relevance items, which assess how well the data are suited to answer the particular question from a decision-making perspective. The report includes a checklist specific to EHR data reporting: the ISPOR SUITABILITY Checklist. It also provides recommendations for HTA agencies and policy makers to improve the use of EHR-derived data over time. The report concludes with a discussion of limitations and future directions in the field, including the potential impact from the substantial and rapid advances in the diffusion and capabilities of large language models and generative artificial intelligence. The report’s immediate audiences are HTA evidence developers and users. We anticipate that it will also be useful to other stakeholders, particularly regulators and manufacturers, in the future.}

Contrary to conventional narratives, China's governance approach adapts existing regulatory tools to meet new challenges, balancing political, social, and economic interests. This study highlights how China has rapidly formalized AI regulations, in areas such as minor protection and content regulation, setting a precedent in global AI governance.

We report an 82-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bilateral bronchiectasis, who presented with progressive dyspnoea and productive cough unresponsive to conventional antibiotic therapy. Nocardia pneumoniae was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage at ≥104CFU/mL. Initial treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP–SMX) was discontinued due to renal impairment and electrolyte disturbances; minocycline was initiated with good tolerance and complete radiological resolution after six months.

Early diagnosis, communication with the microbiology laboratory, and targeted antibiotic therapy are key to improving outcomes.
Resumen
La nocardiosis pulmonar es una infección oportunista poco frecuente, que a menudo se diagnostica erróneamente debido a su inicio subagudo, y a la inespecificidad de sus hallazgos clínicos y radiológicos. Presentamos el caso de un varón de 82 años con enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva crónica (EPOC) grave y bronquiectasias bilaterales, que acudió por disnea progresiva y tos productiva, sin respuesta a la antibioterapia convencional. Se aisló Nocardia pneumoniae en lavado broncoalveolar con una concentración≥104UFC/ml. El tratamiento inicial con trimetoprim-sulfametoxazol (TMP-SMX) se suspendió por deterioro de la función renal y alteraciones hidroelectrolíticas; se inició tratamiento con minociclina con buena tolerancia y resolución radiológica completa a los 6 meses. Este caso subraya la necesidad de sospechar nocardiosis en los pacientes con EPOC y bronquiectasias, incluso en ausencia de inmunosupresión clásica, especialmente tras cursos repetidos de corticoides. El diagnóstico precoz, la comunicación con el laboratorio de microbiología y la antibioterapia dirigida son claves para mejorar el pronóstico.}

abstract = {Background:
Sjögren's disease (SjD) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that primarily affects exocrine glands, with interstitial lung disease (ILD) being a significant extraglandular complication. ILD in SjD is associated with substantial morbidity and can complicate patient outcomes. Both rheumatologists and pulmonologists need to better understand this SjD manifestation in order to improve its management.
Objectives:
To examine the main characteristics and clinical course of a cohort of patients with pSS-ILD, specifically evaluating the proportion of cases progressing to pulmonary progressive fibrosis (PPF).
Methods:
Multicenter longitudinal, retrospective, observational study on a cohort of pSS-ILD patients confirmed by thoracic HRCT. In all cases, the diagnosis of pSS was confirmed by either anti-SSA/Ro positivity or a positive salivary gland biopsy or ultrasound (grade 2 or 3 according to the OMERACT SG US task force group definitions).
Results:
Forty-five patients (91% women) were included, with a mean age at ILD diagnosis of 67 years (SD: 11). Their main characteristics are summarised in Table 1. In 78% of cases (35/45), ILD preceded the diagnosis of pSS by a median of 8 months (IQR 25th–75th: 4–17 months). In the remaining 22% (10/45), ILD appeared as a complication after the diagnosis of pSS, with a median interval of 48 months (IQR 25th–75th: 21–64.5). Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies were positive in 38% of cases with available data (16/42), while anti-SSB/La antibodies were positive in 24.5% (11/45). Both antibodies were negative in 38% of patients (17/45). Based on radiological findings, 26 cases (58%) corresponded to nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (14 with a fibrotic subtype), 6 (13%) to usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), 9 (20%) to organizing pneumonia (OP) or NSIP superimposed with OP, and the remaining 4 (9%) to lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Concomitant follicular bronchiolitis was present in 38% of patients (17/45). At the time of ILD diagnosis, the mean %pFVC was 84.4 ± 21.5 (IQR 70.8–101.7), the mean %pDLCO was 62.2 ± 17.3 (IQR 25th–75th: 48–76), and the mean distance covered in the 6MWT was 371 ± 114 m (IQR 306–422). The mean ESSDAI score was 12 (SD: 5; IQR 25th–75th: 7–16). Treatments included glucocorticoids in 77% of patients (33/43; mean initial dose of prednisone: 32 ± 14 mg/day), immunosuppressants in 77% (33/43; mycophenolate in 31 and azathioprine in 2), and biologic agents in 28% (12/43; rituximab in 11 and abatacept in 1). Antifibrotic agents (nintedanib or pirfenidone) were added in 26% (10/43) of patients due to progression to progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF). After a median follow-up of 56 months since ILD diagnosis (IQR 25th–75th: 30–84), 24% of patients (11/45) required oxygen therapy at their last evaluation due to the development of chronic respiratory failure, 4% (2/45) were referred for lung transplantation, and 18% (8/45) died due to ILD progression and infectious complications.
Conclusion:
In 78% of our cases, ILD was either the presenting symptom or the predominant manifestation that led to the diagnosis of pSS. This condition should be considered in patients with ILD and sicca syndrome, even in the absence of characteristic antibodies, as 38% of our cases were seronegative. At least 26% of patients progressed to PPF, requiring antifibrotic treatment.

abstract = {In times of increasing demand for flexible manufacturing, efficient and flexible design processes are crucial for companies in high-wage countries. Therefore, this work deals with the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the creation of assembly instructions based on an assembly design. To evaluate this potential, we present an evaluation method that assesses the contextual accuracy of a set of assembly instructions. The method provides a measure consisting of the three components of correct assembly sequence of components, correct assembly operations and correct positions. To validate the method, we create 50 variants of a sample assembly, simulate them in the CATIA Delmia assembly simulation environment and generated assembly instructions using a ChatGPT-based RAG model. With the proposed evaluation method, the generated assembly instructions are evaluated for contextual correctness and unambiguity and compared with each other. The results show that our evaluation method for AI-generated assembly instructions is a good first indicator to evaluate the quality in terms of contextual correctness. It also shows that LLMs have the potential with the necessary input and fine-tuning to automate the assembly instruction process.}

abstract = {Background
Patients with breast cancer frequently experience significant uncertainty, prompting them to seek detailed, personalized, and reliable medical information to enhance adherence to prescribed treatments, medications, and recommended lifestyle adjustments. Although high-quality information exists within oncology guidelines and patient-oriented resources, the provision of tailored responses to individual patient queries remains challenging, especially for non–English-speaking populations.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the potential of an artificial intelligence–driven chatbot, specifically leveraging ChatGPT (GPT-4; OpenAI) combined with retrieval-augmented generation, to deliver personalized answers to complex breast cancer-related patient questions in German.
Methods
We collaborated with one of Germany’s largest breast cancer Patient Representation Groups to collect authentic patient inquiries, receiving a total of 118 questions. After initial screening, we selected 104 medical questions, organized into 7 distinct categories: aftercare, bone health, ductal carcinoma in situ, diagnostics, nutrition and supplements, complementary medicine, and therapy. A customized version of GPT-4 was configured with specific system prompts emphasizing empathetic, evidence-based responses and integrated with a comprehensive database comprising guidelines, recommendations, and patient information materials published by recognized German medical societies. To assess chatbot responses, we used 4 evaluation criteria: comprehensibility (clarity from a patient perspective), correctness (accuracy per current medical guidelines), completeness (inclusion of all relevant aspects), and potential harm (risk of undue patient harm or misinformation). Ratings were conducted using a 5-point Likert scale by a breast cancer expert (correctness, completeness, and potential harm) and patient representatives (comprehensibility).
Results
The chatbot provided high-quality responses across multiple dimensions. Of the 499 responses evaluated for comprehensibility, 427 (85.6%) were rated as comprehensible. Among the 104 responses assessed for the remaining dimensions, 91 (87.5%) were rated as correct, 72 (69.2%) as complete, and 93 (89.4%) as nonharmful. Reasons for incomplete answers included omission of reimbursement details, updates from recent therapeutic guidelines, or nuanced recommendations regarding endocrine therapy and aftercare schedules. In addition, 6 (5.8%) of the answers were rated as potentially harmful due to outdated or contextually inappropriate recommendations. The chatbot also performed well in the nutrition and bone health categories despite occasionally incomplete document retrieval.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that an artificial intelligence–powered chatbot with GPT-4 and retrieval augmentation can effectively provide personalized, linguistically accessible, and largely accurate information to German-speaking patients with breast cancer. This approach holds considerable promise for improving patient-centered communication, empowering patients to make informed decisions. Nonetheless, observed limitations regarding response completeness and potential harm underscore the critical need for ongoing human oversight. Future research and development should prioritize regularly updated databases, advanced retrieval methods to handle complex document structures, multimodal capabilities, and clearly articulated disclaimers emphasizing the necessity of professional medical consultation. Our evaluation, along with the provided set of realistic patient questions, establishes a benchmark for future development and validation of German-language oncology chatbots.}

abstract = {Background
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) face challenges such as limited generalizability, insufficient recruitment diversity, and high failure rates, often due to restrictive eligibility criteria and inefficient patient selection. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various clinical tasks, but their potential role in RCT design remains underexplored.
Objective
This study investigates the ability of LLMs, specifically GPT-4-Turbo-Preview, to assist in designing RCTs that enhance generalizability, recruitment diversity, and reduce failure rates, while maintaining clinical safety and ethical standards.
Methods
We conducted a noninterventional, observational study analyzing 20 parallel-arm RCTs, comprising 10 completed and 10 registered studies published after January 2024 to mitigate pretraining biases. The LLM was tasked with generating RCT designs based on input criteria, including eligibility, recruitment strategies, interventions, and outcomes. The accuracy of LLM-generated designs was quantitatively assessed by 2 independent clinical experts by comparing them to clinically validated ground truth data from ClinicalTrials.gov. We have conducted statistical analysis using natural language processing–based methods, including Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)-L, and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering (METEOR), for objective scoring on corresponding LLM outputs. Qualitative assessments were performed using Likert scale ratings (1-3) for domains such as safety, clinical accuracy, objectivity or bias, pragmatism, inclusivity, and diversity.
Results
The LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 72% in replicating RCT designs. Recruitment and intervention designs demonstrated high agreement with the ground truth, achieving 88% and 93% accuracy, respectively. However, LLMs showed lower accuracy in designing eligibility criteria (55%) and outcomes measurement (53%). Natural language processing statistical analysis reported BLEU=0.04, ROUGE-L=0.20, and METEOR=0.18 on average objective scoring of LLM outputs. Qualitative evaluations showed that LLM-generated designs scored above 2 points and closely matched the original designs in scores across all domains, indicating strong clinical alignment. Specifically, both original and LLM-based designs ranked similarly high in safety, clinical accuracy, and objectivity or bias in published RCTs. Moreover, LLM-based design ranked noninferior to original designs in registered RCTs in multiple domains. In particular, LLMs enhanced diversity and pragmatism, which are key factors in improving RCT generalizability and addressing failure rates.
Conclusions
LLMs, such as GPT-4-Turbo-Preview, have demonstrated potential in improving RCT design, particularly in recruitment and intervention planning, while enhancing generalizability and addressing diversity. However, expert oversight and regulatory measures are essential to ensure patient safety and ethical standards. The findings support further integration of LLMs into clinical trial design, although continued refinement is necessary to address limitations in eligibility and outcomes measurement.}

abstract = {Introduction and importance
Placental non-trophoblastic tumors (PNTT) are uncommon, consisting mainly of chorangiomas, placental teratomas (PT) and haemangiomas. PT are exceedingly rare, with less than 40 cases reported in the literature. We, herein, present a case of mature PT arising within the membranes, and we aim to discuss the clinico-pathological characteristics of this rare entity.
Case presentation
A 30-year-old female patient, gravida 1, para 1, with no medical history, was admitted at 40 weeks' gestational age. Ultrasound in the third trimester of pregnancy revealed agenesis of the left fetal kidney and a fundal placenta with increased uterine artery resistance. A cesarean section was performed for failure of labor's induction. Gross examination of the placenta revealed a solid polypoid mass, measuring 4 × 2 cm, attached to the membranes and covered by a smooth cutaneous coating. The cut surface was soft, yellowish, and focally heterogenous, with areas of adipose tissue and cartilage. Microscopic examination revealed that the mass was made up of a mature keratinized squamous layer, with skin appendages, adipose and cartilaginous tissues. The diagnosis of PT was established.
Clinical discussion
PT are rarely suspected on prenatal ultrasonography and the diagnosis is made after delivery. Only pathological examination allows the diagnosis of certainty. Their histogenesis is still poorly understood.
Conclusion
We presented a rare case of mature PT arising within the membranes. PT are extremely uncommon tumors. Usually, they are benign, and no fetal or maternal complications. A better knowledge of these uncommon tumors is mandatory to not miss the diagnosis.}

Primary hypoparathyroidism is a rare but treatable etiology, sometimes associated with Fahr's syndrome. We report a 27-year-old man with a known seizure disorder presenting with multiple daily generalized tonic–clonic seizures unresponsive to polytherapy. Examination revealed positive Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs. Laboratory tests demonstrated severe hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and markedly reduced intact parathyroid hormone, consistent with primary hypoparathyroidism. Non-contrast CT head revealed bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. Recent initiation of phenytoin and carbamazepine—potent enzyme inducers—aggravated hypocalcemia by accelerating vitamin D metabolism. The patient was treated with intravenous calcium gluconate, magnesium sulfate, and switched to levetiracetam. Calcium normalized within 24 h, and seizures resolved.

abstract = {Background
Domestic violence (DV) is a significant public health concern affecting the physical and mental well-being of numerous women, imposing a substantial health care burden. However, women facing DV often encounter barriers to seeking in-person help due to stigma, shame, and embarrassment. As a result, many survivors of DV turn to online health communities as a safe and anonymous space to share their experiences and seek support. Understanding the information needs of survivors of DV in online health communities through multiclass classification is crucial for providing timely and appropriate support.
Objective
The objective was to develop a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) that can provide fast and accurate predictions of the information needs of survivors of DV from their online posts, enabling health care professionals to offer timely and personalized assistance.
Methods
We collected 294 posts from Reddit subcommunities focused on DV shared by women aged ≥18 years who self-identified as experiencing intimate partner violence. We identified 8 types of information needs: shelters/DV centers/agencies; legal; childbearing; police; DV report procedure/documentation; safety planning; DV knowledge; and communication. Data augmentation was applied using GPT-3.5 to expand our dataset to 2216 samples by generating 1922 additional posts that imitated the existing data. We adopted a progressive training strategy to fine-tune GPT-3.5 for multiclass text classification using 2032 posts. We trained the model on 1 class at a time, monitoring performance closely. When suboptimal results were observed, we generated additional samples of the misclassified ones to give them more attention. We reserved 184 posts for internal testing and 74 for external validation. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, along with CIs for each metric.
Results
Using 40 real posts and 144 artificial intelligence–generated posts as the test dataset, our model achieved an F1-score of 70.49% (95% CI 60.63%-80.35%) for real posts, outperforming the original GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, fine-tuned Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B, and long short-term memory. On artificial intelligence–generated posts, our model attained an F1-score of 84.58% (95% CI 80.38%-88.78%), surpassing all baselines. When tested on an external validation dataset (n=74), the model achieved an F1-score of 59.67% (95% CI 51.86%-67.49%), outperforming other models. Statistical analysis revealed that our model significantly outperformed the others in F1-score (P=.047 for real posts; P<.001 for external validation posts). Furthermore, our model was faster, taking 19.108 seconds for predictions versus 1150 seconds for manual assessment.
Conclusions
Our fine-tuned LLM can accurately and efficiently extract and identify DV-related information needs through multiclass classification from online posts. In addition, we used LLM-based data augmentation techniques to overcome the limitations of a relatively small and imbalanced dataset. By generating timely and accurate predictions, we can empower health care professionals to provide rapid and suitable assistance to survivors of DV.}

Consensus-based large language model (LLM) ensembles might provide an automated solution for extracting structured data from unstructured text in echocardiography reports.
Methods
This cross-sectional study utilised 600 intraoperative transoesophageal reports (100 for prompt engineering; 500 for testing) randomly sampled from 7106 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery at two hospitals within the University of Pennsylvania Healthcare System. Three echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular systolic function, and tricuspid regurgitation) were extracted from both the presurgical and postsurgical sections of the reports. LLM ensembles were generated using five open-source LLMs and four voting strategies: (1) unanimous (five out of five in agreement); (2) supermajority (four or more of five in agreement); (3) majority (three or more of five in agreement); and (4) plurality (two or more of five in agreement). Returned LLM ensemble responses were compared with the reference standard dataset to calculate raw accuracy, consensus accuracy, error rate, and yield.
Results
Of the four LLM ensembles, the unanimous LLM ensemble achieved the highest consensus accuracies (99.4% presurgical; 97.9% postsurgical) and the lowest error rates (0.6% presurgical; 2.1% postsurgical) but had the lowest data extraction yields (81.7% presurgical; 80.5% postsurgical) and the lowest raw accuracies (81.2% presurgical; 78.9% postsurgical). In contrast, the plurality LLM ensemble achieved the highest raw accuracies (96.1% presurgical; 93.7% postsurgical) and the highest data extraction yields (99.4% presurgical; 98.9% postsurgical) but had the lowest consensus accuracies (96.7% presurgical; 94.7% postsurgical) and highest error rates (3.3% presurgical; 5.3% postsurgical).
Conclusions
A consensus-based LLM ensemble successfully generated structured data from unstructured text contained in intraoperative transoesophageal reports.}

keywords = {Rapid review, Nursing informatics, Large language models, Generative AI, ChatGPT},
abstract = {Background
The application of large language models across commercial and consumer contexts has grown exponentially in recent years. However, a gap exists in the literature on how large language models can support nursing practice, education, and research. This study aimed to synthesize the existing literature on current and potential uses of large language models across the nursing profession.
Methods
A rapid review of the literature, guided by Cochrane rapid review methodology and PRISMA reporting standards, was conducted. An expert health librarian assisted in developing broad inclusion criteria to account for the emerging nature of literature related to large language models. Three electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched to identify relevant literature in August 2023. Articles that discussed the development, use, and application of large language models within nursing were included for analysis.
Results
The literature search identified a total of 2028 articles that met the inclusion criteria. After systematically reviewing abstracts, titles, and full texts, 30 articles were included in the final analysis. Nearly all (93 %; n = 28) of the included articles used ChatGPT as an example, and subsequently discussed the use and value of large language models in nursing education (47 %; n = 14), clinical practice (40 %; n = 12), and research (10 %; n = 3). While the most common assessment of large language models was conducted by human evaluation (26.7 %; n = 8), this analysis also identified common limitations of large language models in nursing, including lack of systematic evaluation, as well as other ethical and legal considerations.
Discussion
This is the first review to summarize contemporary literature on current and potential uses of large language models in nursing practice, education, and research. Although there are significant opportunities to apply large language models, the use and adoption of these models within nursing have elicited a series of challenges, such as ethical issues related to bias, misuse, and plagiarism.
Conclusion
Given the relative novelty of large language models, ongoing efforts to develop and implement meaningful assessments, evaluations, standards, and guidelines for applying large language models in nursing are recommended to ensure appropriate, accurate, and safe use. Future research along with clinical and educational partnerships is needed to enhance understanding and application of large language models in nursing and healthcare.}

abstract = {Introduction
This research delves into the transformative role of blockchain technology within a dual-channel supply chain framework, emphasizing its influence on enhancing product transparency in the public health domain. By ensuring the traceability and authenticity of health-related products, blockchain can significantly alter the pricing dynamics for brand manufacturers. The study explores how increased transparency can lead to more informed consumer choices, potentially affecting demand patterns and, consequently, the pricing strategies adopted by brand sellers. Ultimately, the research aims to understand how these pricing adjustments impact the overall profitability and market position of these sellers within the public health sector.
Method
This research uses a model consisting of a platform and upstream brand sellers, focusing on public health products. It analyzes the cost-effectiveness of brand sellers adopting blockchain technology in two channels: direct sales and platform sales, as well as the choice of public health products between two sales models: wholesale and agency.
Results
The study finds that in the field of public health, the cost of adopting blockchain technology has a significant impact on the decision-making of brand sellers. Under low-cost conditions, brand sellers tend to adopt blockchain to improve the transparency of public health products, which can not only attract health-conscious consumers but also increase market share and enhance brand image. The level of on-chain costs also affects the choice of brand sellers between wholesale and agency models, as well as the pricing strategy of public health products. Under the wholesale model, lower retail prices and higher demand help to increase the profits of brand sellers in public health products.
Discussion
We found that the type of distribution contract has a profound impact on the adoption of blockchain strategies by competitive brand sellers in the field of public health. Brand sellers need to choose appropriate sales models and blockchain application strategies based on their own situations and market environments to enhance the transparency of public health products, attract consumers, increase market share, and improve brand image. At the same time, governments and relevant institutions should also actively promote the application and development of blockchain technology in the field of public health to ensure public health and safety.}

abstract = {Purpose
To describe the use of a commercially available general large language model (LLM) in extracting and interpreting several key metrics from entire raw corneal tomography (Pentacam) reports for the diagnosis of corneal disorders.
Observation
Anonymized corneal tomography biometry reports of 50 eyes of 50 patients with healthy corneas (n = 28), keratoconus (n = 20) and post-surgical ectasia (n = 2) were analyzed by a multimodal general LLM. System prompts were used to extract flat and steep keratometry values (K1 and K2, respectively), astigmatism, pachymetry values and provide an overall diagnosis. Accuracy of data extraction was 100% across all metrics and the model provided a diagnosis in agreement with the two observers in all eyes. Pachymetry and maximum keratometry values were the most common metric used to formulate the diagnosis and was cited in all eyes. This was followed by specifically citing the highest elevation map values (88%) and degree of astigmatism (74%).
Conclusion
and importance: In this proof-of-concept study, a commercially available multimodal LLM was able to extract data from raw corneal tomography reports with high accuracy and with retention of spatial context, and formulated correct diagnoses with excellent proficiency. This study demonstrates the use of emerging LLMs as diagnostic adjuncts through the synthesis of multimodal data.}

abstract = {Background
The deployment of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.5 and its subsequent versions, ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-4 With Vision (4V; also known as “GPT-4 Turbo With Vision”), has notably influenced the medical field. Having demonstrated remarkable performance in medical examinations globally, these models show potential for educational applications. However, their effectiveness in non-English contexts, particularly in Chile’s medical licensing examinations—a critical step for medical practitioners in Chile—is less explored. This gap highlights the need to evaluate ChatGPT’s adaptability to diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4V in the EUNACOM (Examen Único Nacional de Conocimientos de Medicina), a major medical examination in Chile.
Methods
Three official practice drills (540 questions) from the University of Chile, mirroring the EUNACOM’s structure and difficulty, were used to test ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4V. The 3 ChatGPT versions were provided 3 attempts for each drill. Responses to questions during each attempt were systematically categorized and analyzed to assess their accuracy rate.
Results
All versions of ChatGPT passed the EUNACOM drills. Specifically, versions 4 and 4V outperformed version 3.5, achieving average accuracy rates of 79.32% and 78.83%, respectively, compared to 57.53% for version 3.5 (P<.001). Version 4V, however, did not outperform version 4 (P=.73), despite the additional visual capabilities. We also evaluated ChatGPT’s performance in different medical areas of the EUNACOM and found that versions 4 and 4V consistently outperformed version 3.5. Across the different medical areas, version 3.5 displayed the highest accuracy in psychiatry (69.84%), while versions 4 and 4V achieved the highest accuracy in surgery (90.00% and 86.11%, respectively). Versions 3.5 and 4 had the lowest performance in internal medicine (52.74% and 75.62%, respectively), while version 4V had the lowest performance in public health (74.07%).
Conclusions
This study reveals ChatGPT’s ability to pass the EUNACOM, with distinct proficiencies across versions 3.5, 4, and 4V. Notably, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have not significantly led to enhancements in performance on image-based questions. The variations in proficiency across medical fields suggest the need for more nuanced AI training. Additionally, the study underscores the importance of exploring innovative approaches to using AI to augment human cognition and enhance the learning process. Such advancements have the potential to significantly influence medical education, fostering not only knowledge acquisition but also the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among health care professionals.}

abstract = {Introduction
Radial club hand is a rare congenital malformation with functional and aesthetic repercussions.
Presentation of case
We present the case of a 6-year-old boy with bilateral hand deformity, associated with hypoplasia of the thenar muscles and aplasia of the radius (Bayne stage IV). After bilateral ulnar radialisation, recovery was favorable, with stability of the hand axis and a fine grip allowing writing. At 18 months postoperatively, the child was able to integrate into school without assistance.
Discussion
Radial clubhands are rare malformations, often treated late in Madagascar due to a lack of resources. Despite these challenges, simple techniques like ulnar radialization can achieve excellent outcomes with minimal equipment.
Conclusion
Surgery remains essential, even in cases treated late.}
