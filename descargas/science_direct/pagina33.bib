abstract = {Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) leverages the photoacoustic effect to provide high-resolution structural and functional imaging. However, achieving high-speed imaging with high spatial resolution remains challenging. To address this, undersampling and deep learning have emerged as common techniques to enhance imaging speed. Yet, existing methods rarely achieve effective recovery of functional images. In this study, we propose Mask-enhanced U-net (MeU-net) for recovering sparsely sampled PAM structural and functional images. The model utilizes dual-channel input, processing photoacoustic data from 532 nm and 558 nm wavelengths. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive vascular attention mask module that focuses on vascular information recovery and design a vessel-specific loss function to enhance restoration accuracy. We simulate data from mouse brain and ear imaging under various levels of sparsity (4 ×, 8 ×, 12 ×) and conduct extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that MeU-net significantly outperforms traditional interpolation methods and other representative models in structural information and oxygen saturation recovery.}

However, existing GenAI chatbots’ output is predominantly presented in plain, text-only formats, which may impose a high cognitive load and trigger negative emotional responses. Despite growing interest in GenAI-assisted writing instruction, limited research has examined how visual enhancements to GenAI chatbot output might improve revision outcomes and learners’ emotional experiences. Grounded in the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media, this study employed a self-developed GenAI-powered writing chatbot to investigate the effects of visualised feedback on EFL learners’ writing performance and emotional responses during revision. A 2 (time: pre-test and post-test) × 2 (feedback mode: visualised vs. non-visualised) quasi-experimental design was employed. Group A (N = 30) received standard text-only feedback, while Group B (N = 30) received visualised feedback incorporating colour variation, tabular formatting, and bolded text. Results from pre-and post-tests and questionnaires indicated that visualised feedback significantly improved coherence and cohesion in learners’ writing, reduced negative emotions, and resulted in lower cognitive load. These findings offer practical implications for language educators, learners, and developers, highlighting the critical role of how AI-generated content is presented in building emotionally supportive and cognitively effective GenAI-assisted learning environments.}

To address this, four workshops were held during the 28th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai. These workshops gathered insights into the experiences of urban children and youth in cities affected by climate change through discussions with youth and other stakeholders present at COP28. Opportunities for creating healthier and more sustainable youth-focused cities were identified using a participatory approach. Youth facilitators led discussions between participants and an expert panel, and participants shared their experiences and perspectives of growing up in cities and their hopes for future youth-focused cities amidst a changing climate. Narrative was collected through an online collaboration tool, which was fed into an artificial intelligence tool to generate images, which served as triggers for further discussion. The thematic analysis of the narratives was conducted by a team of early-career researchers. Three themes were identified: the effects of climate change on urban youth, visions for healthier and more sustainable cities prioritising youth, and principles guiding action. The findings emphasize the importance of involving young people and representing children's needs in research and decision-making.}

Until now, it has only been possible to calculate the apparent velocity of groundwater flow in the karst system after obtaining experimental field investigation to verify e.g. the movement of pollution through the underground karst system, by applying the dye-tracing test technique using a dye tracer. The methodology for calculation of the apparent velocity of groundwater flow takes into account the measured “actual or real” travel time and shortest (air) distance (path) between sites of dye insertion and dye appearance which means that it does not include the “actual or real” distance with multidimensionality and extremely nonlinear behavior of karst system. In contrast with this methodology, the calculation of mean translational velocity is based on “actual or real” data of measured travel time and distance required that dye appears on springs from the moment when the dye was inserted in the sinkhole, and the minor and major semi-axes of the boundary ellipse. This mathematically presented novel methodology takes into account information such as measured travel time and environmental characteristics (aquifer boundaries) which makes novel methodology innovative and sustainable. Since it would be good to know the velocity as close as possible to the “actual or real” groundwater flow velocity, the paper discusses the possibility of obtaining the mean translational velocity based on theoretical calculations and improving the existing calculation of the apparent velocity of groundwater flow. Additionally, the value of this paper is a quantification of the relationships between the qualitative features of the karst system, i.e. makes them measurable contributing to SDG6.}

The purpose of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of WMSDs among small-scale construction workers in Namibia's capital city of Windhoek, located in Southern Africa. A cross-sectional survey in Windhoek, Namibia, involved 117 workers from four small-scale construction companies. Self-administered questionnaires and in-depth interviewing procedures were employed in the research to compile data on the occurrence of WMSDs associated with among workers in small-scale construction. Both descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis were conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The findings revealed the symptoms and prevalence of WMSDs in several body parts among the small-scale construction employees surveyed. The research findings further showed that 28 % of respondents lacked safety knowledge for the intention to work safely, whereas 72 % of respondents who planned to work safely indicated greater levels of safety knowledge. Age, brick size and repetitive work were the job risk factors that positively correlated with WMSDs. The results suggest for instance that as the worker ages, so do the chances to contract WMSDs. Overall, the study demonstrated that mechanical, individual, and psychosocial factors all influence the frequency of WMSDs among workers in small-scale construction. However, further research is needed to provide solutions on occupational health of small scale construction workers and on training and awareness of ergonomic risk factors in relation to WMSDs.}

This paper explores whether there are differences in the information behaviour of high school students when choosing a higher education institution (HEI) based on the educational attainment of their parents. We focus on the social factors of information behaviour in the post-conflict society of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Design/methodology/approach
We use Bourdieu’s social theory to demonstrate the need for a deeper inclusion of the social context for a more comprehensive understanding of information behaviour, and Bronfenbrenner’s theory of human development to propose a model for social interventions to reduce information inequality. Using the concept of cultural capital (CC), Bourdieu explains the reproduction of social inequalities through the educational system. We apply this concept to explain information behaviour when choosing an HEI as a partially socially conditioned behaviour. In a quantitative study, we investigate how the institutionalized form of parents’ CC is reflected in their children’s information behaviour in selecting an HEI.
Findings
There are two different patterns of information behaviour of high school seniors when choosing an HEI based on the institutionalized CC of their parents, especially fathers. The group of respondents whose fathers have a higher academic degree shows a different “taste” in using information sources and channels compared to the group whose fathers have a lower degree. These findings suggest that the lack of CC functions as an internalized structural barrier that shapes information behaviour on an unconscious level, and that social context operates on multiple levels.
Originality/value
This is one of the first papers that applies Bourdieu’s concept of CC and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory to understand the social dimension of information behaviour.}

abstract = {In sludge dewatering of most wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the dose of polymer flocculant is manually adjusted through direct visual inspection of the flocs without the aid of any instruments. Although there is a demand for the development of automatic control of flocculant dosing, this has been challenging owing to the lack of a reliable flocculation sensor. To address this issue, this study developed a novel image sensor for measuring the degree of flocculation (DF) based on deep learning. Two types of sludge samples were used in the laboratory-scale flocculation tests: excess sludge and mixtures of excess sludge and raw wastewater. To search for a deep learning regression model suitable for DF inference, ten models, including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and a multilayer perceptron MLP mixer, were comparatively analysed. The ConvNeXt and MLP mixer models showed the highest accuracies with coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.9. The region contributing to the DF inference in the flocculation images was visualised using a modulus-weighted, gradient-weighted regression activation map. A prototype of the flocculation sensor was constructed using an inexpensive EdgeAI device. This device comprises a single-board computer and an integrated graphical processing unit (GPU) and is equipped with a quantised ConvNeXt model. The maximum inference speed of the sensor was 12.8 frames per second (FPS). The flocculation control tests showed that the sensor could control the DF to the target value by adjusting the polymer flocculant dose. Therefore, the flocculation sensor can provide a data-driven approach to the management of the flocculation process, thereby facilitating the automation of WWTPs.}

In June 2023, an online survey was conducted among a sample of 740 smartphone users aged 45 years or older (Max = 78) in Hong Kong. Using exploratory factor analysis, we found three factors from the General Attitude to Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) - Perils, Power, and Promises. Subsequently, with latent profile analysis we revealed three latent profiles: (i) Enthusiasts (18.4%; high on Promises and Power but low on Perils); (ii) Skeptics (12.3%; high on Perils but low on Promises and Power), and (iii) Indecisive (69.3%; moderate on all three factors). The Enthusiasts were more likely to be male, with higher socio-economic status, better self-rated health, and greater mobile device proficiency, optimism, innovativeness, but also less insecurity with technology, compared to the Indecisive, and then to the Skeptics. Our findings suggest that most middle-aged and older adults in Hong Kong hold an ambivalent view towards AI, appreciating its power and potentials while also cognizant of the perils it may entail. Our findings are timely considering the recent debates on ethical use of AI evoked by smart phone applications such as ChatGPT and will be valuable for practitioners and scholars for developing inclusive AI-facilitated services and applications.}

To compare the responses of the large language model-based “ChatGPT” to reputable sources when given fertility-related clinical prompts.
Design
The “Feb 13” version of ChatGPT by OpenAI was tested against established sources relating to patient-oriented clinical information: 17 “frequently asked questions (FAQs)” about infertility on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Website, 2 validated fertility knowledge surveys, the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score, as well as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion “optimizing natural fertility.”
Setting
Academic medical center.
Patient(s)
Online AI Chatbot.
Intervention(s)
Frequently asked questions, survey questions and rephrased summary statements were entered as prompts in the chatbot over a 1-week period in February 2023.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
For FAQs from CDC: words/response, sentiment analysis polarity and objectivity, total factual statements, rate of statements that were incorrect, referenced a source, or noted the value of consulting providers.
For fertility knowledge surveys
Percentile according to published population data.
For Committee Opinion
Whether response to conclusions rephrased as questions identified missing facts.
Result(s)
When administered the CDC’s 17 infertility FAQ’s, ChatGPT produced responses of similar length (207.8 ChatGPT vs. 181.0 CDC words/response), factual content (8.65 factual statements/response vs. 10.41), sentiment polarity (mean 0.11 vs. 0.11 on a scale of -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)), and subjectivity (mean 0.42 vs. 0.35 on a scale of 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective)). In total, 9 (6.12%) of 147 ChatGPT factual statements were categorized as incorrect, and only 1 (0.68%) statement cited a reference. ChatGPT would have been at the 87th percentile of Bunting’s 2013 international cohort for the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and at the 95th percentile on the basis of Kudesia’s 2017 cohort for the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score. ChatGPT reproduced the missing facts for all 7 summary statements from “optimizing natural fertility.”
Conclusion(s)
A February 2023 version of “ChatGPT” demonstrates the ability of generative artificial intelligence to produce relevant, meaningful responses to fertility-related clinical queries comparable to established sources. Although performance may improve with medical domain-specific training, limitations such as the inability to reliably cite sources and the unpredictable possibility of fabricated information may limit its clinical use.

abstract = {Background
Early treatment is critical for improving eating disorder prognosis. Single-session interventions (SSIs) can provide short-term support to people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment; however, it is not always possible to access SSIs. We co-designed and developed a rule-based chatbot called ED ESSI (Eating Disorder Electronic Single-Session Intervention), which delivered an SSI and demonstrated its acceptability and feasibility. However, the effectiveness of ED ESSI is yet to be investigated.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of an SSI delivered by ED ESSI. We examined the chatbot’s impact on eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, stress, and motivation for change or treatment in individuals aged ≥16 years on waitlists for treatment for all types of eating disorders.
Methods
This multicenter 2-armed randomized controlled trial included 60 people on waitlists for eating disorder treatment in the chatbot intervention group (n=30, 50%) or the control group (n=30, 50%). The ED ESSI chatbot guided participants through a 30-minute SSI of assessment and psychoeducation, while the control group received web-based information on the same core topics covered in the SSI. There were 4 time points: before intervention or baseline (time point 1 [T1]), after intervention within 72 hours of baseline (T2), 1 month after baseline (T3), and 3 months after baseline (T4). Eating disorder pathology (primary outcome) and psychosocial impairment, depression, anxiety, and stress (secondary outcomes) were measured at T1, T3, and T4, and motivation for change or treatment (secondary outcome) was measured at all 4 time points. Furthermore, the System Usability Scale was implemented at T2 for the chatbot intervention group only.
Results
ED ESSI induced significantly greater reductions compared to the control group in the primary outcome of eating disorder pathology (P=.003) and secondary outcomes of psychosocial impairment (P=.008), depression (P=.002), and anxiety (P=.040) over the 1- and 3-month time points, with small to moderate effects (Cohen d=0.15-0.53). Chatbot use also induced an increase in participants’ confidence in their ability to change (secondary outcome) immediately after use (T2), with a moderate effect (P<.001; Cohen d=0.74). The chatbot was rated as “excellent” in terms of usability. A significantly higher proportion of participants in the chatbot group (28/30, 93%) entered treatment by 3 months upon the opportunity being offered to them, compared to the control group, with a moderate effect (21/30, 70%; P=.042; ϕ=0.30).
Conclusions
ED ESSI promptly induced improvements in eating disorder pathology, psychosocial impairment, depression, and anxiety, which were detectable at 1 month and maintained to 3 months. ED ESSI potentially represents an effective, accessible, and scalable form of early intervention for people aged ≥16 years waiting for eating disorder treatment. Further research is needed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of ED ESSI.

abstract = {Bioaerosols are the primary route for pathogen transmission, and have a serious negative impact on human health. Accurately measuring the distribution of bioaerosol concentrations in the indoor environment holds significant importance. Current methodologies are constrained by limitations in measurement resolution and speed, and unable to obtain the global 3D concentration fields directly. We propose a Sparse Reconstruction Latent Diffusion Model (SR-LDM) that reconstructs the 3D global concentration field from the asynchronous sparse bioaerosol concentration data measured by LiDAR. The concentration field reconstruction is formulated as a conditional generation task, leveraging the powerful generative capabilities of the Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) to infer global distributions from sparse observational data. We employ a contrastive learning strategy to train a dedicated condition encoder, which extracts information from spatiotemporal sparse data measured at different locations and times to guide the generation of the global concentration field. We use a validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver to construct a dataset of aerosol concentration fields in an empty channel. The results indicate that our SR-LDM model effectively reconstructs the global concentration field formed by a single release source, using historical sparse measurement data that accounts for 1 %–3.2 % of the total number of units. In most cases, high-quality results are obtained after 6–16 iterations, and the similarity with CFD data reaches 80 %.}

For this purpose, the text was camouflaged among 30 other summaries made by real 15-year-old students and was evaluated by 30 Spanish language teachers with different profiles in terms of age, professional experience, and gender who were unaware that one of the texts was made by artificial intelligence (AI). The evaluation of the summary, for which a homogeneous rubric is used, is based on two fundamental criteria: content and style. For the data analysis descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used. The results show that the ChatGPT summary obtained the best marks in terms of content and style, with its respective marks being 3 and 2.5 points higher than those of the students. Therefore, we can deduce that the style and content of the ChatGPT summary greatly exceeded those presented by the students. These results are independent of the ages, levels of professional experience, and genders of the teachers who corrected the summary. The integration of AI tools such as ChatGPT must be based on solid methodological proposals that integrate their use from a creative and critical perspective that allows learning with the support of these tools and not using them as substitutes for the development of basic student competencies.}

This study examines individuals' willingness to pay to reduce automation risk, using a discrete-choice experiment conducted with nearly 6000 participants. Results reveal that respondents accept a salary reduction of almost 20 % of the Swiss median annual gross wage to reduce their automation risk by 10 percentage points or, conversely, demand a 20 % risk premium to accept an equivalent increase in automation risk. Interestingly, the study finds that WTP for risk reduction increases with higher baseline automation risk levels, contrary to patterns observed in other contexts. While preferences are generally homogeneous, differences exist between demographic groups. Men, younger and risk-tolerant individuals, and those with higher education show lower willingness to pay for reduced automation risk. By having respondents express preferences for hypothetical children, the study also explores potential gender biases, finding no significant differences in willingness to pay for reduced automation risk, educational degrees, hierarchical position, or wage based on the child's gender.}

abstract = {In recent years there has been a surge of research on arts professionals' livelihoods, with particular focus on experiences of work and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, using the HEartS Professional multi-strategy survey, we collected data in three phases in the United Kingdom (UK): initially during the first national lockdown (Phase 1, April–June 2020; Spiro, Perkins et al., 2021), and then annually for two years; Phase 2 (April–May 2021; Spiro, Shaughnessy et al., 2023), and Phase 3 (May–July 2022). In this article, we focus on Phase 3. Our first goal is to explore which factors are important in the context of mental and social wellbeing (measured using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the 15-item Social Connectedness Scale-Revised, and the Three-Item Loneliness Scale). Our second goal is to consider how work and wellbeing are associated with job satisfaction. Physical activity, social activity, financial stability, and health are significantly associated with mental and social wellbeing for the 564 professional artists in the UK who responded to our survey, and there are links between mental wellbeing and job satisfaction. As the creative industries emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and tackle ongoing challenges, a longer-term approach in this area is needed: one that allows a more holistic understanding of the contributors to arts professionals' work and wellbeing. Informed by the data collected in Phases 1 to 3, where we see consistent trends, we propose a conceptual model – the HEartS Professional Model – for understanding the drivers that are associated with arts professionals' wellbeing and job satisfaction. Within this model, the variables can be seen as part of wider domains: broad thematic groups including community (including perceived social connection and living situation), healthy living (including self-rated health and physical activity), finance (including financial hardship and household income), and demographics (including gender and age). The HEartS Professional Model has the potential to inform development of support, policy, and infrastructure in the creative industries that are fit for purpose and respond to creative professionals’ needs. Furthermore, it has the potential to be the basis for the long-term tracking and understanding of work, wellbeing, and job-satisfaction in the arts.}

This study, therefore, investigates whether the use of generative AI tools could help student authors construct a more consistent voice in multimodal writing. In this study, we have designed a photo essay assignment where students recount a story in the form of photo essays and prompt AI image-generating tools to create photos for their storytelling. Drawing on interview data, written reflections, written annotations, and multimodal products from seven focal participants, we have identified two remixing practices–layering and blending–through which students attempted to establish a coherent and unique voice in writing. The study sheds light on the intentional and discursive nature of multimodal writing with AI as afforded by the technological flexibility, while also highlighting the practical and ethical challenges that could be attributed to students’ insufficient prompt and multimodal literacy and the innate limitations of AI systems. This study provides important implications for incorporating AI tools in designing multimodal writing tasks.}

abstract = {Damage imaging plays a crucial role in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems for fast and efficient damage assessment. Delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming is a widely used algorithm in non-destructive testing for damage imaging, but its effectiveness is often compromised by the use of sparse ultrasonic transducer arrays and the difficulty in detecting progressive delamination larger than the wavelength using guided wave-based methods under fatigue loading. Although X-ray imaging offers detailed assessments of progressive delamination, its application is still limited due to the need to interrupt fatigue loading cycles and its high operational cost. To this end, we propose a novel Damage Imaging framework that uses the fine-tuned Conditional Diffusion Model for SHM systems (DI-CDM). Leveraging the powerful image generation capabilities of diffusion models, the framework was fine-tuned by combining DAS beamforming images derived from ultrasonic sparse array data with X-ray images captured during fatigue loading cycles of the composite structures. The proposed approach can generate damage images that reveal the progression of delamination size in the fatigue loading process. The framework was validated through numerical simulations and experimental data from NASA datasets for composite structures, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness by applying diffusion models in SHM applications to enable fast, high-resolution damage imaging.}

Findings revealed significant positive correlations between leadership skills and digital responsibility, underscoring that developing strategic vision, communication, motivation, and ethical decision-making significantly enhances responsible online conduct. Notably, while leadership skills predicted both digital responsibility and personal freedom, public freedom emerged as a particularly robust predictor of digital responsibility. This highlights the importance of empowering students within the public sphere to foster ethical digital practices.

This study proposes a lightweight assessment model for transformer windings, integrating an image fusion module and a recognition module to address the accuracy limitations of single-image analysis and the high computational demands of multi-scale analysis. First, a Parallel Efficient Mixed Attention Mechanism (PEMAM) is proposed, designed to enhance adaptability to transformer vibration signals while maintaining a low parameter count. This mechanism improves the feature extraction capability of the Image Fusion Framework based on a Convolutional Neural Network, significantly boosting the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing resistance to distortion in fused images. Subsequently, multi-scale Markov field images, derived from the time and frequency domain features of vibration signals, are fused and fed into the PEMAM-enhanced recognition module for condition assessment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 99.63 % accuracy in identifying transformer winding conditions while maintaining low model complexity and computational cost.}

Through modeling learner knowledge using Bayesian network, the research constructs a game framework of entrepreneurial education for adaptive learning. On this basis, a new feature crossover method is proposed to construct a deep knowledge tracking model based on feature embedding and attention mechanism. It was combined with adaptive learning technology to ultimately construct an entrepreneurial education game model that integrates adaptive learning and improved deep knowledge tracking.

In this study we employ the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) checklist to evaluate the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence for Student Performance Prediction (AI4SPP), an AI-powered system designed to detect students at risk of school failure. We strongly support the ethical and legal development of AI and propose an implementation design where the user can choose to have access to each level of a three-tier outcome bundle: the AI prediction alone, the prediction along with its confidence level, and, lastly, local explanations for each grade prediction together with the previous two information. AI4SPP aims to raise awareness among educators and students regarding the factors contributing to low school performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of interventions not only to help students, but also to address biases within the school community. However, we also emphasize the ethical and legal concerns that could arise from a misuse of the AI4SPP tool. First of all, the collection and analysis of data, which is essential for the development of AI models, may lead to breaches of privacy, thus causing particularly adverse consequences in the case of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the system’s predictions may be influenced by unacceptable discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background, leading to unfair actions. The ALTAI checklist serves as a valuable self-assessment tool during the design phase of AI systems, by means of which commonly overlooked weaknesses can be highlighted and addressed. In addition, the same checklist plays a crucial role throughout the AI system life cycle. Continuous monitoring of sensitive features within the dataset, alongside survey assessments to gauge users’ responses to the systems, is essential for gathering insights and intervening accordingly. We argue that adopting a critical approach to AI development is essential for societal progress, believing that it can evolve and accelerate over time without impeding openness to new technologies. By aligning with ethical principles and legal requirements, AI systems can make significant contributions to education while mitigating potential risks and ensuring a fair and inclusive learning environment.}

Several studies have depicted an essential role for dampened mitophagy and mitochondrial injury in Dox cardiotoxicity. However, preventative measure to alleviate Dox-evoked cardiotoxicity via targeting mitophagy and mitochondrial integrity remains elusive. Urolithin A (UA) is a newly identified mitophagy inducer with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties although its effect on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is unknown. This study was designed to explore the effect of UA on Dox cardiotoxicity and mechanisms involved. Our results indicated that UA alleviated Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction exhibited by echocardiographic parameters and histological analyses, and partially relieved Dox-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, and mitochondrial dysfunction including ΔΨm dissipation and ROS production in vitro. The ability of UA to facilitate restoration of mitophagy in mice and H9C2s underscored its advantageous effects, manifested as upregulation of mitophagy-related proteins, including p62, LC3, PINK1 and Parkin, as well as the co-location between LC3 and mitochondria. Incubation with 3 -MA nearly reversed the UA-evoked rise of mitophagy-related proteins, and inhibition of apoptosis. Given that knockdown of Ambra1 almost abolished UA-induced protective effect, the enhanced expression of Ambra1 owing to UA increased PINK1 levels by inhibiting its degradation via LONP1. Collectively, our results suggest that the cardioprotective properties of UA depend on the stimulation of PINK1-dependent mitophagy through promoting Ambra1 expression to inhibit PINK1 degradation by LONP1. This highlights UA's potential as a valuable treatment option and its importance in cardioprotective strategies against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.}

abstract = {Background
In the United States, 1 in 5 adults currently serves as a family caregiver for an individual with a serious illness or disability. Unlike professional caregivers, family caregivers often assume this role without formal preparation or training. Thus, there is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of family caregivers to provide quality care. Leveraging technology as an educational tool or an adjunct to care is a promising approach that has the potential to enhance the learning and caregiving capabilities of family caregivers. Large language models (LLMs) can potentially be used as a foundation technology for supporting caregivers. An LLM can be categorized as a foundation model (FM), which is a large-scale model trained on a broad data set that can be adapted to a range of different domain tasks. Despite their potential, FMs have the critical weakness of “hallucination,” where the models generate information that can be misleading or inaccurate. Information reliability is essential when language models are deployed as front-line help tools for caregivers.
Objective
This study aimed to (1) develop a reliable caregiving language model (CaLM) by using FMs and a caregiving knowledge base, (2) develop an accessible CaLM using a small FM that requires fewer computing resources, and (3) evaluate the model’s performance compared with a large FM.
Methods
We developed a CaLM using the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework combined with FM fine-tuning for improving the quality of FM answers by grounding the model on a caregiving knowledge base. The key components of the CaLM are the caregiving knowledge base, a fine-tuned FM, and a retriever module. We used 2 small FMs as candidates for the foundation of the CaLM (LLaMA [large language model Meta AI] 2 and Falcon with 7 billion parameters) and adopted a large FM (GPT-3.5 with an estimated 175 billion parameters) as a benchmark. We developed the caregiving knowledge base by gathering various types of documents from the internet. We focused on caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. We evaluated the models’ performances using the benchmark metrics commonly used in evaluating language models and their reliability for providing accurate references with their answers.
Results
The RAG framework improved the performance of all FMs used in this study across all measures. As expected, the large FM performed better than the small FMs across all metrics. Interestingly, the small fine-tuned FMs with RAG performed significantly better than GPT 3.5 across all metrics. The fine-tuned LLaMA 2 with a small FM performed better than GPT 3.5 (even with RAG) in returning references with the answers.
Conclusions
The study shows that a reliable and accessible CaLM can be developed using small FMs with a knowledge base specific to the caregiving domain.}

Physicians diagnose patients using histopathological images of tissue biopsies from potentially infected areas of the colon and lung. Most types of lung and colon cancer are challenging to diagnose and often require numerous tests. The article presents a novel approach to identify pulmonary and colorectal tumors using deep learning algorithms on histopathology images. Our objective is to develop a dependable and efficient system that uses pre-trained CNNs with LC25000 histopathological image datasets to accurately identify malignant tissues. This work promotes medical examination and artificial intelligence by resolving significant challenges in cancer detection and improving the accuracy and effectiveness of pathological assessment. The implemented deep learning algorithms are: Vgg16 with random forest classifier, Vgg16 with Xgboost classifier, and GLCM with LightGBM. The results of Vgg16 with the Xgboost classifier technique showed better performance, with 97.46% accuracy. In the future, we can use image segmentation to conduct research on nuclei detection and cell segmentation. We can utilize GAN, which significantly enhances the accuracy of medical image segmentation due to its strong generation capabilities and ability to capture data distribution.}

abstract = {Background
A diagnostic criterion for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is difficulty concentrating and increased distractibility. One form of distraction that occurs in everyday life is mind-wandering. The current study aims to test how individuals with MDD and healthy controls differ in their mind-wandering in everyday life.
Methods
Adults diagnosed with MDD (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 53) completed a week of experience sampling, with prompts administered up to eight times per day. At each prompt, participants reported the occurrence and characteristics of their mind-wandering. They also reported levels of momentary negative affect (NA), positive affect (PA), and rumination.
Results
MDD participants reported mind-wandering almost twice as often as healthy control participants. Compared to healthy participants, MDD participants rated their mind-wandering as more negative, but did not differ in terms of temporal orientation. Higher NA and lower PA predicted mind-wandering in the MDD group but not healthy controls, even after controlling for rumination. Time-lagged analyses revealed that current mind-wandering predicted future levels of PA in MDD participants but not in healthy controls; in contrast, current NA and PA did not predict future mind-wandering.
Limitations
Limitations include our examination of specific forms of mind-wandering (i.e., we did not sample the full spectrum of this construct).
Conclusions
Individuals with MDD frequently report engaging in mind-wandering in everyday life, and this appears to be coupled with affect. Mind-wandering may have maladaptive effects in MDD and could serve as a target for intervention.}

keywords = {Traditional Chinese Medicine, medicine food homology, large language model, retrieval-augmented generation, uncertain knowledge graph, dietary recommendation},
abstract = {Background
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) emphasizes the concept of medicine food homology (MFH), which integrates dietary therapy into health care. However, the practical application of MFH principles relies heavily on expert knowledge and manual interpretation, posing challenges for automating MFH-based dietary recommendations. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in health care decision support, their performance in specialized domains such as TCM is often hindered by hallucinations and a lack of domain knowledge. The integration of uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) with LLMs via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising solution to overcome these limitations by enabling a structured and faithful representation of MFH principles while enhancing LLMs’ ability to understand the inherent uncertainty and heterogeneity of TCM knowledge. Consequently, it holds potential to improve the reliability and accuracy of MFH-based dietary recommendations generated by LLMs.
Objective
This study aimed to introduce Yaoshi-RAG, a framework that leverages UKGs to enhance LLMs' capabilities in generating accurate and personalized MFH-based dietary recommendations.
Methods
The proposed framework began by constructing a comprehensive MFH knowledge graph (KG) through LLM-driven open information extraction, which extracted structured knowledge from multiple sources. To address the incompleteness and uncertainty within the MFH KG, UKG reasoning was used to measure the confidence of existing triples and to complete missing triples. When processing user queries, query entities were identified and linked to the MFH KG, enabling retrieval of relevant reasoning paths. These reasoning paths were then ranked based on triple confidence scores and entity importance. Finally, the most informative reasoning paths were encoded into prompts using prompt engineering, enabling the LLM to generate personalized dietary recommendations that aligned with both individual health needs and MFH principles. The effectiveness of Yaoshi-RAG was evaluated through both automated metrics and human evaluation.
Results
The constructed MFH KG comprised 24,984 entities, 22 relations, and 29,292 triples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Yaoshi-RAG in different evaluation metrics. Integrating the MFH KG significantly improved the performance of LLMs, yielding an average increase of 14.5% in Hits@1 and 8.7% in F1-score, respectively. Among the evaluated LLMs, DeepSeek-R1 achieved the best performance, with 84.2% in Hits@1 and 71.5% in F1-score, respectively. Human evaluation further validated these results, confirming that Yaoshi-RAG consistently outperformed baseline models across all assessed quality dimensions.
Conclusions
This study shows Yaoshi-RAG, a new framework that enhances LLMs’ capabilities in generating MFH-based dietary recommendations through the knowledge retrieved from a UKG. By constructing a comprehensive TCM knowledge representation, our framework effectively extracts and uses MFH principles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in synthesizing traditional wisdom with advanced language models, facilitating personalized dietary recommendations that address individual health conditions while providing evidence-based explanations.}

Image processing techniques have gained attention for detecting early signs of disease by analyzing abnormal poultry manure. However, building a reliable system for identifying and locating abnormal manure in real-world conditions remains challenging and requires large amounts of labeled data for supervised learning. Among deep learning models, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) detector is widely used in precision agriculture due to its speed and accuracy. Herein, a new dataset was created for abnormal poultry manure identification based on updated classification criteria, which included 5688 bounding box annotations across five categories collected from commercial chicken farms. In total, 21 state-of-the-art YOLO models from 8 YOLO versions (YOLOv3–YOLOv9) were fine-tuned and validated to establish comprehensive benchmarks. Detection accuracy in terms of mAP@0.5 ranged from 95.6 % by YOLOv3-tiny to 99.4 % by YOLOv8m, while accuracy in terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95] ranged from 72.9 % by YOLOv4-tiny to 82.2 % by YOLOv9s, with 10 models achieving scores above 80.0 % in mAP@0.5:0.95. High accuracy and efficiency were demonstrated by YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s with inference times under 3 ms. However, traditional data augmentation methods were not fully effective in expanding abnormal manure samples. To address this issue, generative models were explored for data augmentation, where denoising diffusion probabilistic models generated realistic images, showing promising potential. This research provides benchmark data for the classification of abnormal poultry manure, which will become an important resource for promoting future research on poultry disease detection and control based on big data and artificial intelligence, making a fundamental contribution to the field of poultry health monitoring.}

The ability to detect fake videos among Hungarian secondary school students (N = 507) was assessed using a 16-item video test. The results of the online survey are partly consistent and partly contradictory to the literature. There is no gender difference in the ability to detect fake videos in the age group studied, and media literacy and media use do not influence the ability to detect fake videos. However, a more conservative worldview and higher parental education are associated with better detection of fake videos. The paper concludes with recommendations.}

Caregivers of children with mental health challenges are at heightened risk for burnout and absenteeism. This strain affects both their well-being and work performance, contributing to widespread workplace issues. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) are increasingly used to support pediatric mental health, but their impact on caregiver outcomes remains underexplored.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the associations between caregiver burnout, absenteeism (ie, missing work), comorbid symptoms, and child mental health problems, and to assess whether caregiver burnout and absenteeism improved as their child participated in a pediatric DMHI.
Methods
This retrospective study included 6506 caregivers whose children (aged 1‐17 years) received care from Bend Health, Inc, a pediatric DMHI providing digital-based therapy and coaching, digital content, and caregiver support. Caregiver burnout, absenteeism, comorbid symptoms, and child mental health symptoms were measured by monthly assessments. Cumulative link models were used to assess the associations of between child symptoms and caregiver outcomes and to assess changes in caregiver outcomes over the course of the DMHI. Analyses of baseline associations included the full sample (n=6506), while analyses of pre-post changes in caregiver outcomes were conducted in caregivers with elevated burnout (n=2121) and absenteeism (n=1327) who had an assessment after starting care.
Results
At baseline, 45.96% (2990/6506) of caregivers reported elevated burnout and 28.96% (1884/6506) reported elevated absenteeism. More severe burnout was associated with having a child with elevated symptoms of any type (all P<.01). More severe absenteeism was significantly associated with having a child with elevated symptoms of depression (z=3.33; P<.001), anxiety (z=3.96; P<.001), inattention (z=2.48; P=.013), and hyperactivity (z=2.12; P=.03). Burnout decreased for 68.64% (1456/2121) and absenteeism decreased for 87.26% (1158/ 1327). Greater months in care was associated with less severe caregiver burnout (z=−5.48; P<.001) and absenteeism (z=−6.74; P<.001).
Conclusions
DMHIs for children may reduce caregiver burnout and absenteeism. These findings emphasize the value of employers offering pediatric DMHIs as part of employee benefits, potentially enhancing workplace outcomes.}

IED is associated with a host of cognitive and affective symptoms not included in the diagnostic criteria which may be a valuable indicator of heterogeneity in IED—such information can be useful to enhance understanding and treatment of this disorder in mental health settings. A preliminary investigation conducted on cognitive-affective symptom heterogeneity in individuals with a history of IED demonstrated that level of emotional dysregulation primarily differentiated IED subgroups, however the sample size was limited, and almost half of the individuals did not have current IED (only lifetime IED). The present study addressed these limitations by conducting a latent class analysis of cognitive-affective symptoms among a large (n = 504) sample of individuals diagnosed with current IED. The latent IED classes were then externally validated on several adverse outcomes, historical precursors, and demographic variables. Statistical and clinical indicators supported a four-class model, with classes primarily distinguished by patients' severity of emotion dysregulation. The two moderate emotion-dysregulated classes both endorsed callous-unemotional traits and low empathy relative to other classes, a finding which differs from the initial investigation. An external validation of the four classes revealed that they significantly differed on severity outcomes (e.g., aggression, suicide attempts, antisocial behavior, global functioning, comorbidities) and historical precursors (e.g., aversive parental care, childhood maltreatment). These findings provide further insight into the heterogeneity within IED and the associations of such variability with important precursors and clinical outcomes.}

Unknown cause–effect relationships lead to production deviations and costly scrap. Therefore, data-driven approaches are increasingly being used to uncover these complex interactions. Creating comprehensive, transparent data sets based on production data, enables the identification of correlations and relevant parameters, thus facilitating efficiency improvements and the optimization of the lithium-ion production. Currently, tracking and tracing of production data to individual electrode sections is performed with physical markers on uncoated electrode parts or coils. Interactions within the processing of the battery electrodes and mechanical deformation of the current collector foil can lead to illegibility of the physical markings and thus make tracking and tracing impossible. Furthermore, the resolution of the data recording is currently tied to the discrete markings. However, advances in computer vision and computing power offer a non-invasive, marker-free solution using camera images. This paper presents an approach of unique identification of electrode sections using image-matching for marker-free tracking and tracing applications. High-resolution electrode images were acquired in-line, allowing the evaluation of artificial intelligence to demonstrate the applicability of different classical and learning-based image-matching approaches for the identification of electrode sections. The results provided a clear recommendation for image-based tracking and tracing using neuronal networks. Marker-free tracking using electrode images allowed for immediate identification of electrode sections, storage of production data in a virtual electrode model, and inclusion of additional quality information derived from the images.}

abstract = {Background
Gas explosion injuries are a severe form of trauma with high incidence and mortality rates, both in daily life and industrial settings. Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most serious complications of gas explosion injuries and is a leading cause of mortality in such cases. However, the mechanisms underlying gas explosion-induced ALI have not been fully elucidated, and the treatment process consumes a significant amount of medical resources. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on the injury mechanisms of gas explosion injuries, especially the mechanisms of gas explosion-induced ALI, which can effectively improve the treatment rate of this condition. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between a novel form of cell death, ferroptosis, and gas explosion-induced ALI, and explored its specific mechanisms.
Methods
We established ALI rat model by Shock tube biological injury system, and detected lung injury-related indexes as well as ferroptosis related indexes, such as glutathione peroxidase 4（GPX4）, 4-hydroxynonenal（4HNE）, Malondialdehyde（MDA）, Fe2 + . We also investigated the therapeutic effects of the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) in ALI induced by gas explosion, as well as its specific mechanisms of action.
Results
A rat ALI model by gas explosion was successfully established. After the gas explosion treatment, we observed that the systemic inflammatory reaction of rats was increased, and lung function, liver function, kidney function and cardiac function were damaged to different degrees. The inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissue was more severe, and the degree of lung injury and pulmonary edema increased. The ferroptosis markers GPX4 was decreased, while the levels of 4HNE, MDA and Fe2 + were increased. Treatment with Fer-1 significantly ameliorated gas explosion ALI damage and down-regulated the expression level of ferroptosis.
Conclusions
Gas explosion-induced ALI in rats is characterized by enhanced inflammatory responses and reduced antioxidant capacity in lung tissues. The specific mechanism of injury involves ferroptosis. Fer-1 has been shown to mitigate the severity of ALI caused by gas explosion by suppressing ferroptosis expression levels in lung tissues via the Nrf2/GPX4 axis.}

abstract = {The visual appearance of a city is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including cultural backgrounds, geographical features, historical developments, and policy decisions. But measuring cities' visual uniqueness remains a challenge. Previous studies often focused on iconic landmarks, neglecting everyday scenes that people are likely to encounter. By examining how and to what extent different visual patterns build up unique characteristics of cities, we propose a data-driven framework to measure visual uniqueness in terms of identity and distinctiveness. We performed bottom-up visual clustering on Google Street View (GSV) images in the six most visited Japanese cities. We found that 8 representative visual clusters explain each city's visual identity and relative distinctiveness. This research demonstrates how artificial intelligence applied to visual data can reveal subtle differences in urban environments. In the era of growing globalization, with frequent tourism and intercity visits, the cultivation of a city's unique visual characteristics can help avoid the homogenization of urban landscapes, and stimulate the development of urban tourism by shaping an imageable city.}

Specifically, in the field of adult education, there are limited studies on the effect of GenAI on teaching and learning. This study employs a cross-sectional quantitative design to examine the relationships between SDL, AL, and CT in the context of adult learners' use of GenAI tools like ChatGPT. It considers how demographic variables moderate these relationships. The study was underpinned by the SDL theory by Tough in 1971. An analysis of 281 survey responses of adult learners grouped by generation from five (5) adult higher education institutions in Ghana was performed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA (analysis of variance), and SEM (structural equation modeling). The study’s findings indicate that GenAI is perceived as having a significant positive effect on the SDL, AL, and CT of adult learners. A significant positive interrelationship was observed between SDL, AL, and CT. Demographic factors involving gender, year born (generational group), education level, and mode of learning had a perceived significant positive effect on SDL, AL, and CT. Notably, no statistical mean differences were found in the use of GenAI for SDL, AL, and CT across generational groups. The findings advocate for the effective adoption of GenAI to foster lifelong learning among adult learners. Developers of learning technologies and higher education leaders should ensure an inclusive GenAI design.}

abstract = {Background
Sleep health is a multidimensional construct that includes objective and subjective parameters and is influenced by individual sleep-related behaviors and sleep disorders. Symptom network analysis allows modeling of the interactions between variables, enabling both the visualization of relationships between different factors and the identification of the strength of those relationships. Given the known influence of sex and age on sleep health, network analysis can help explore sets of mutually interacting symptoms relative to these demographic variables.
Objective
This study aimed to study the centrality of symptoms and compare age and sex differences regarding sleep health using a symptom network approach in a large French population that feels concerned about their sleep.
Methods
Data were extracted from a questionnaire provided by the Réseau Morphée health network. A network analysis was conducted on 39 clinical variables related to sleep disorders and sleep health. After network estimation, statistical analyses consisted of calculating inferences of centrality, robustness (ie, testifying to a sufficient effect size), predictability, and network comparison. Sleep clinical variable centralities within the networks were analyzed by both sex and age using 4 age groups (18-30, 31-45, 46-55, and >55 years), and local symptom-by-symptom correlations determined.
Results
Data of 35,808 participants were obtained. The mean age was 42.7 (SD 15.7) years, and 24,964 (69.7%) were women. Overall, there were no significant differences in the structure of the symptom networks between sexes or age groups. The most central symptoms across all groups were nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In the youngest group, additional central symptoms were chronic circadian misalignment and chronic sleep deprivation (related to sleep behaviors), particularly among women. In the oldest group, leg sensory discomfort and breath abnormality complaint were among the top 4 central symptoms. Symptoms of sleep disorders thus became more central with age than sleep behaviors. The high predictability of central nodes in one of the networks underlined its importance in influencing other nodes.
Conclusions
The absence of structural difference between networks is an important finding, given the known differences in sleep between sexes and across age groups. These similarities suggest comparable interactions between clinical sleep variables across sexes and age groups and highlight the implication of common sleep and wake neural circuits and circadian rhythms in understanding sleep health. More precisely, nonrestorative sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are central symptoms in all groups. The behavioral component is particularly central in young people and women. Sleep-related respiratory and motor symptoms are prominent in older people. These results underscore the importance of comprehensive sleep promotion and screening strategies tailored to sex and age to impact sleep health.}

Although human-generative AI (GenAI) collaborative programming learning might have the potential to enhance personalized programming education, GenAI's interplay with SRL processes remains underexplored. To address this gap, this study first proposed a SRL Behavior Analysis Framework for human-GenAI collaborative programming learning environments and then examined SRL behaviors of a group of sixth-grade students (n = 36) in such an environment using this framework, along with various learning analytics methods including cluster analysis, descriptive statistics and lag sequential analysis. The analysis yielded the following results: (1) Based on their learning performance, primary school students were identified as three distinct clusters: programming specialized unit (PSU), high performance unit (HPU), and low performance unit (LPU). (2) Regarding SRL behaviors, students prioritized self-control (65.8 %), followed by self-observation (19 %), task analysis (12.1 %), and behavior stagnation (3.2 %). (3) Students in PSU and HPU consistently adopted goal-oriented SRL strategies, whereas students in LPU exhibited passive dependence and fragmented strategy use. GenAI's facilitative effect in supporting learning correlated with users' SRL capabilities. (4) Students in PSU and HPU exhibited frequent transitions between SRL behaviors, whereas students in LPU had insufficient ability to switch strategies when facing programming difficulties. Based on these findings, this study proposed four forward-looking design recommendations: effectively integrating GenAI with the programming environment, utilizing multimodal data and AI for learning assessment and feedback, building a cluster-driven early warning mechanism, and conducting dynamic SRL analysis and guidance based on fine-grained time-series data.}

abstract = {Background
Stress is a significant issue amongst university students, yet limited psychological services are available. Mindfulness is effective for stress reduction and can be delivered digitally to expand access to student populations. However, digital interventions often suffer from low engagement and poor adherence. A virtual human may improve engagement and adherence through its humanlike appearance and behaviours.
Objective
To examine whether a virtual human could reduce stress in university students at least as much as a teletherapist, and more than a chatbot, using a mindfulness intervention.
Methods
Stressed university students (N = 158) were randomly allocated to the virtual human (N = 54), chatbot (N = 54), or teletherapist (N = 50). 36 participants received each condition. Participants completed one lab session and were asked to do online homework sessions at least twice weekly for four weeks. Changes in self-reported stress and mindfulness, physiological stress indices, homework completion, and perceptions of the agent were compared between groups. Thematic analysis was conducted on participants’ responses to open-ended questions about the interventions.
Results
There were significant reductions in stress and increases in mindfulness across all groups. All groups had higher peripheral skin temperature post-intervention, and only the teletherapy group had higher electrodermal activity (reflecting elevated stress) post-intervention compared to baseline. There were no significant changes in heart rate. Homework adherence was significantly higher in the virtual human group, whereas homework satisfaction and engagement were lowest in the chatbot group. Thematic analysis found that people thought the robotic voice of the virtual human could be improved, the chatbot could be improved by adding audio, and that participants experienced feelings of judgement from the teletherapist.
Discussion
Overall, results support use of virtual humans for delivering mindfulness interventions in stressed students. Virtual humans may have the advantage over teletherapy and chatbots of increasing adherence in student populations, but more work is needed to increase perceived empathy and replicate results in other populations.}

With the advancement of information technology and globalization, distance open education has become increasingly vital in the global education system, offering flexible learning opportunities and promoting equitable resource distribution. However, English learning in this context faces significant challenges, such as the digital divide, fragmented attention, and delayed feedback, which impact learning outcomes and learner enthusiasm. To address these challenges, this paper validates a remote English learning strategy system through comparative experiments, focusing on four dimensions: goal management, multimodal learning, interactive reinforcement, and motivation maintenance. The results show significant improvements in learners' English proficiency, motivation, and retention rates, providing valuable insights for optimizing curriculum design. In summary, the proposed strategy system offers effective learning methods and references for both learners and educational institutions. Future research and practice are expected to further explore and refine this area,}

Although ∼40 % of precipitation in certain regions is recycled moisture from Africa's tropical rainforest, there needs to be more knowledge about how this moisture supports the continent's agriculture. In this study, we quantify all moisture sources for agrarian precipitation (African agricultural precipitationshed), the estimates of African rainforest's moisture contribution to agricultural precipitation, and the evaporation from agricultural land across the continent. Applying a moisture tracking model (UTRACK) and a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJmL), we find that the Congo rainforest (>60 % tree cover) is a crucial moisture source for many agricultural regions. Although most of the rainforest acreage is in the DRC, many neighboring nations rely significantly on rainforest moisture for their rainfed agriculture, and even in remote places, rainforest moisture accounts for ∼10–20 % of agricultural water use. Given continuous deforestation and climate change, which impact rainforest areas and resilience, more robust governance for conserving the Congo rainforest is necessary to ensure future food production across multiple Sub-Saharan African countries.}

My critical self-reflection paper seeks to understand the community's concerns and, thereby, to discern theoretical insights that conceptually contribute towards a theory of AC. Drawing on autoethnography, I identified three distinct perceived matters of concern represented by anthropomorphic personalities or faces of AC: Trickster, Surveyor, and Harbinger. The findings reveal that the Trickster is the most monstrous and disconcerting face of AC. It may be prankish or deceptive, but can also be beneficent and supportive. While the Surveyor provides surveillance, measurement, and calculation, the Harbinger announces competing future visions, one of utopian hope and the other of dystopian despair. I conclude by discussing the implications of three underlying theoretical variables: trust, creative value, and creative personal identity.}

abstract = {Background
There has been controversy over the extent to which technology use in general—and social media exposure specifically—may be associated with adverse youth mental health outcomes. To date, studies have generally been small and exploratory, relying on youth self-reports to characterize technology and social media use patterns. The goal of this study is to explore the associations between objectively collected data, gathered through a commercially available app, and youth mental health outcomes.
Objective
The broad goal of this study is to characterize the association between objectively measured technology/social media use and a range of mental health–related outcomes. Three specific aims will be initially addressed. First, we aim to quantify the association between objectively measured smartphone use and measures of well-being. Second, we aim to differentiate types of engagement—specifically, the types of content consumed versus the overall time spent on the device—and examine their association with outcomes. Third, we aim to identify moderating factors, such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status, that might influence these relationships. A secondary broad objective of this research is to establish a freely available data resource that can be accessed by qualified investigators to address a much wider range of questions in the future.
Methods
Up to 1000 male, female, and nonbinary youth aged 8-17 years (inclusive), along with their primary caregivers, will be enrolled in the study. Youth participants must have their own dedicated iOS- or Android-based smartphone or tablet, and both they and their parents must be willing and able to download and install the data collection app on their devices. The study is open to all US-based participants who meet these 2 criteria. Following electronic consent (eConsent), participants and their caregivers will complete a range of baseline measures electronically, including assessments of psychiatric and social functioning, as well as measures of loneliness, digital stress, and disordered eating. Caregivers will be asked to provide information on the participant’s health and mental health history. Youth and caregivers will then complete a similar battery of assessments 1, 2, and 3 months after baseline. Youth participants will also respond to daily questions about their mood, stress, physical activity, and sleep. Both youth and their caregivers will be compensated for completing measures at each time point. The data collection app gathers a wide range of daily data from the participant’s device, including temporal patterns of use, the number and frequency of various app usage, social interactions within apps, and keystroke data. A variety of analytic methods will be used to address key questions related to how technology and social media use are associated with mental health and wellness outcomes.
Results
Enrollment for this study began on November 13, 2024. As of May 20, 2025, a total of 106 participants and their caregivers had consented to participate and provided baseline data. An additional 203 children and parents have consented and are currently undergoing eligibility verification and enrollment. Initial data analysis is anticipated to begin in late autumn 2025 or winter 2026, with the expected publication of initial findings in spring 2026.
Conclusions
This study will be among the largest to date to collect both objective device usage data and validated, clinically relevant outcome measures. In accordance with our data-sharing policies, any qualified investigator will be able to access the study data, provided appropriate steps are followed.

abstract = {Background
Nowadays, the internet has become the primary source of information for physicians seeking answers to medical questions about their patients before consulting colleagues. However, many websites provide low-quality, unreliable information that lacks scientific validation. Therefore, physicians must develop strong information search skills to locate relevant, accurate, and evidence-based content. However, previous studies have shown that physicians often have poor search skills and struggle to find information on the web, which may have detrimental consequences for patient care.
Objective
This study aims to determine how medical students and residents searched for medical information on the internet, the quality of the web resources they used (including their nature and credibility), and how they evaluated the reliability of these resources and the answers they provided. Given the importance of domain knowledge (in this case, medicine) and information search skills in the search process, we compared the search behaviors of medical students and residents with those of computer science students. While medical students and residents possess greater medical-related knowledge, computer science students have stronger information search skills.
Methods
A total of 20 students participated in this study: 10 medical students and residents, and 10 computer science students. Data were extracted from a freely accessible data set in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. All participants searched for medical information online to make a diagnosis, select a treatment, and enhance their knowledge of a medical condition—3 primary activities they commonly perform. We analyzed search performance metrics, including search time, the use of medical-related keywords, and the accuracy of the information found, as well as the nature and credibility of web resources used by medical students and residents compared with computer science students.
Results
Medical students and residents provided more accurate answers than computer science students without requiring additional time. Their medical expertise also enabled them to better assess the reliability of resources and select high-quality web sources, primarily from hospital websites. However, it is noteworthy that they made limited use of evidence-based tools such as PubMed.
Conclusions
Although medical students and residents generally outperformed computer science students, they did not frequently use evidence-based tools. As previously observed, they may avoid databases due to the risk of encountering too many irrelevant articles and difficulties in applying appropriate filters to locate relevant information. Nevertheless, clinical and practical evidence-based medicine plays a crucial role in updating physicians’ knowledge, improving patient care, and enhancing physician-patient relationships. Therefore, information search skills should be an integral part of medical education and continuing professional development for physicians.}

However, our understanding of the effect of lipid nanostructure on interactions of NCs with bacteria is lacking. Herein, we investigate the interactions of four different lipid NCs (including both cubosomes and hexosomes) with a simple bacterial supported lipid bilayer (SLB) mimicking the lipid bilayer of Escherichia coli (E. coli) using a combination of total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF-M), quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Addition of the fusogenic lipid di-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) increased interactions with the SLB, while addition of the cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) significantly increased interactions. The QCM-D data and SR-SAXS data indicate that mixing of the particles with E. coli mimicking model layers results in significant disruption to the cubosome structure, while hexosomes remain essentially structurally intact. We propose that the interaction mechanism with bacterial membranes differs among lipid NCs; while cubosomes primarily fuse with the lipid bilayer resulting in a loss of internal nanostructure, hexosomes interact with bacterial membranes via a different mechanism which allows them to retain structural integrity.}

Juvenile male rats (n = 35) were divided into: control (distilled water), Mn (100 mg/kg MnCl₂), EA (30 mg/kg), vehicle, and Mn+EA groups. After 28 days of oral treatment, behavioral tests (OFT, EPM, ART) were conducted. Tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, MDA), neuroinflammation (TNF-α), dopamine, AChE, gene expression (DMT1, Nrf2, Sod1), and histopathology. Mn induced locomotor deficits, anxiety-like behaviour, sensorimotor hyper-reactivity, oxidative stress (↓SOD/CAT, ↑MDA), elevated TNF-α, and reduced dopamine. EA co-treatment reversed behavioural impairments, restored antioxidant activity, normalized TNF-α/dopamine, EA suppressed Mn-induced Dmt1 upregulation, a key compensatory Mn uptake pathway in juveniles, while activating Nrf2, representing a novel dual protective mechanism. Histology confirmed EA preserved neuronal integrity and reduced hepatorenal damage. In conclusion, EA-associated downregulation of Dmt1 and downstream biochemical/histological improvements provide indirect evidence consistent with reduced Mn influx, but requires confirmation by direct brain Mn quantification.}

Despite this, current research has yet to account for approaches that govern ambivalent customer behavior. To close this gap, we introduce a novel research conceptualization that considers a customer’s engagement with technology as an interaction with instrumental, symbolic, identity, and aesthetic cues. Building on the results of a hermeneutic literature review and construction of a pathway model, we demonstrate the potential of a cue-based design approach for Customer Facing Technologys (CFTs). The cue-based design emphasizes the reinforcing or oppositional interactions of signals surrounding the engagement with technology, making it possible to address ambivalence. Ultimately, we propose reconsidering the way CFTs are currently investigated in research to help explain deviations in customer behavior.}

Dam-breaks are complete if the dam is totally and suddenly removed, or partial if the breach is smaller than the dam. While the behaviour of dam-break waves following the complete structural failure has been extensively studied, research on partial dam break scenarios remains limited. A special partial dam break scenario, consisting of a breach opening at the dam bottom, can be modelled in laboratory experiments with the sudden partial lifting of a sluice gate. Until now, the mathematical and numerical modelling of this partial dam break has received only partial scrutiny, and it is still unclear if the solutions predicted by existing models are those effectively observed in real-world scenarios or laboratory experiments. This study addresses these gaps by confronting the results of the analytical and numerical models proposed by Cozzolino et al. (2023) with recent laboratory experimental data from the literature. The comparison reveals that the inviscid exact solution to the partial dam break problem can reliably predict the type, number, and height of the moving waves developed under both free and submerged flow conditions. The agreement with experimental data is enhanced when applying the numerical model by Cozzolino et al. (2023), owing to the inclusion of dissipative effects through the frictional term. These results advocate extending the existing flow gate equations, usually found in steady flow conditions, to the case of strong transients. The findings further corroborate the application of the Shallow water Equations to the simulation of strong transients in open channels, even in the presence of flow-structure interactions such as those involving sluice gates, bridges, and flood control barrages.}

This systematic review aims to determine potential metabolic biomarkers and pathways linked to DRE, which could inform personalized treatment and optimize therapeutic outcomes. A comprehensive search of databases, namely Medline, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria yielded 29 eligible studies after full-text screening. The risk of bias from these studies was reviewed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool. Key information, including study groups, sample size, model types, and main findings were tabulated. Several metabolites were identified, including amino acids (glycine, glutamate, isoleucine), organic acids (lactate), and glucose, which may serve as potential biomarkers for DRE. MetaboAnalyst 6.0 pathway analysis identified the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, as well as phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis pathways, emerged with significant impact score (≥0.5, p < 0.05).

Addressing this gap, the study examines how IGS can act as pivotal sites for reshaping urban planning paradigms, promoting spatial justice, and facilitating bottom-up governance. Using a case study of Jiulongyuan Community, located on the urban fringe of Hefei City, the research employs in-depth interviews and non-participatory observation to trace the emergence and evolution of guerrilla gardens through four distinct stages. Findings reveal that community residents use guerrilla gardening as a from of everyday resistance, challenging traditional top-down planning structures and generating new forms of spatial and political agency. This study contributes contemporary urban planning theory by emphasizing the role of value co-creation, grassroots spatial interventions, and the aesthetic order embedded in informal green practices.}

Most existing approaches rely on mapping neural signals to pretrained models to generate latent variables, which are then used to reconstruct images via a diffusion model. However, this multi-step process can result in the loss of crucial semantic details, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel brain decoding framework, called Memory Recall (MR), inspired by bionic brain mechanisms. MR mimics the human visual perception process, where the brain retrieves stored visual experiences to compensate for incomplete visual cues. Initially, low- and high-level visual cues are extracted using spatial mapping techniques based on VAE and CLIP, replicating the brain’s ability to interpret degraded stimuli. A visual experience database is then created to retrieve complementary information that enriches these high-level representations, simulating the brain’s memory retrieval process. Finally, an Attentive Visual Signal Fusion Network (AVSFN) with a novel attention scoring mechanism integrates the retrieved information, enhancing the generative model’s performance and emulating the brain’s refinement of visual perception. Experimental results show that MR outperforms state-of-the-art models across multiple evaluation metrics and subjective assessments. Moreover, our results provide new evidence supporting a well-known psychological conclusion that the basic information capacity of short-term memory is four items, further demonstrating the informativeness and interpretability of our model.}

Grounded in art infusion theory, two experiments using a 2 × 2 between-subjects design were conducted to test the effects of generative art in virtual fashion retail settings. The results of Study 1 (N = 120) reveal that the presence of generative art enhanced store visit intentions by increasing perceived exclusivity and aesthetic pleasure, with this effect moderated by brand type (mass vs. luxury). The results of Study 2 (N = 90) revealed that the dynamism of generative art positively influenced word-of-mouth intentions through two mediators, with the effect moderated by consumers’ artistic openness (low vs. high). This study contributes to the retail literature by identifying generative art as a novel environmental cue that enhances consumer experience, with its effectiveness shaped by both contextual and individual factors. Moreover, the findings provide practical insights for retailers and service providers seeking to leverage generative art as an affordable and sustainable tool to foster positive consumer responses.}

“Am I hungry? Did I overeat at lunch?” Gastric interoception - the sensing, interpretation, and regulation of signals from the gastrointestinal system - is central to daily behavior and homeostasis. Dysfunctional gastric interoception has been proposed as a maintenance factor in both eating disorders and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, no qualitative research has explored how individuals across these groups, and the general population, subjectively experience gastrointestinal signals, known as gastric interoceptive sensibility. This study aimed to investigate how gastric sensations are sensed, interpreted, and regulated among individuals with eating disorders, gastric disorders, and those without such diagnoses, focusing on identifying shared experiences. Methods: Fifteen semi-structured focus groups (n = 96) were conducted. Transcripts underwent hybrid deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Findings: Four key themes were identified. In “Sensations in the Interoceptive Body”, participants described hunger and fullness as physically aversive or reported an absence of cues related to satiation. “Perceiving the Interoceptive Body” captured the noticing, interpreting, attending to, and reacting to sensations of hunger, satiation, and fullness. In “Affective Experiences of the Interoceptive Body”, participants discussed how these sensations influenced emotional states positively, negatively, or not at all. “Responding to the Interoceptive Body” described participants strategies relating to relief-seeking, compensation, acceptance, distraction, and body checking in response to gastric sensations. Discussion: These findings shed light on the nuanced components of gastric interoceptive sensibility and suggest that individuals vary in how they experience and manage gastric signals. This work may inform interoceptive exposure therapies targeting maladaptive interpretations and regulation strategies in eating and gastrointestinal symptoms.}

This approach compensates for the lack of information in the small target dataset by pre-training the model on a large source dataset. However, when the target dataset is further reduced to a small-sample size, existing methods struggle to maintain the performance of the transfer model, leading to rapid performance deterioration. To address this drawback, we propose PMSS, a Projection Module based on the Shape Space theory, to enhance the transfer model’s capability in small-sample scenarios. We first pre-train the model on the source dataset and save it, then use the pre-trained model to extract features from the target dataset. These extracted features, originally in the Euclidean space, are projected into the pre-shape space through PMSS for subsequent training. Furthermore, a class-aware attention mechanism is introduced during the learning process, enhancing the feature representation to improve the model’s ability to handle small-sample tasks. Extensive experiments on 10 backbone networks and 5 datasets demonstrate PMSS’s effectiveness. Specifically, PMSS achieved accuracy improvements of 6 %, 8 %, and 13 % on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and their small-sample subsets respectively. PMSS’s plug-and-play design requires no architectural changes, making it directly applicable to real-world systems with limited data. When compared with the latest manifold learning methods and robust transfer learning methods, PMSS achieves the state-of-the-art performance.}

This study aims to explore the impact and mechanisms of an online summer camp incorporating generative AI (GenAI)-enabled microteaching lesson study on the technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of prospective secondary mathematics teachers (PSMTs).
Design/methodology/approach
A mixed-methods research approach was employed, with 21 PSMTs participating in a 9-day online summer camp that included two rounds of microteaching lesson study, expert lectures, plenary discussions, and group discussions. Data were collected using pre- and post-mathematics-specific TPACK scales, teaching artifacts, and qualitative reflections to evaluate the evolution of PSMTs’ TPACK and identify key influencing factors.
Findings
The study reveals statistically significant improvements across all sub-domains of the TPACK framework among PSMTs. The degree of improvement in the TPACK sub-domain varied among participants, with some experiencing significant enhancement, others moderate gains, and a few showing smaller changes. The study identifies four critical factors driving TPACK development: expert guidance, practical exploration, collaborative learning, and ongoing reflection, which enhanced PSMTs’ incorporation of digital technologies (e.g. GeoGebra, GenAI) into their teaching practices.
Research limitations/implications
This study demonstrates that incorporating GenAI into microteaching lesson study significantly enhances TPACK, thereby highlighting its potential for structured, scaffolded teacher professional development. Additionally, the study shows that online formats can effectively support teachers’ TPACK development, offering a replicable model for future programs.
Originality/value
This study innovatively incorporates GenAI into microteaching lesson study, offering a novel approach to enhance PSMTs’ TPACK. It also validates a mathematics-specific TPACK scale and identifies key factors for effective teacher professional development in technology-integrated environment.}

Early detection of SAD lays the foundation for the introduction of early interventions. However, due to the nature of social avoidance in social anxiety, the screening is challenging in the clinical setting. Classic questionnaires also bear the limitations of subjectivity, memory biases under repeated measures, and cultural influence. Thus, there exists an urgent need to develop a reliable and easily accessible tool to be widely used for social anxiety screening. Here, we developed the Social Artificial Intelligence Picture System (SAIPS) based on generative multi-modal foundation artificial intelligence (AI) models, containing a total of 279 social pictures and 118 control pictures. Social scenarios were constructed to represent core SAD triggers such as fear of negative evaluation, social interactions, and performance anxiety, mapping to specific dimensions of social anxiety to capture its multifaceted nature. Pictures devoid of social interactions were included as a control, aiming to reveal response patterns specific to social scenarios and to improve the system’s precision in predicting social anxiety traits. Through laboratory and online experiments, we collected ratings on SAIPS from five dimensions. Machine learning results showed that ratings on SAIPS robustly reflected and predicted an individual’s trait of social anxiety, especially social anxiety and arousal ratings. The prediction was reliable, even based on a short version with less than 30 pictures. Together, SAIPS may serve as a promising tool to support social anxiety screening and longitudinal predictions.}

Higher loading of active electrode materials is desired in batteries, especially those based on conversion reactions, for enhanced energy density and cost efficiency. However, increasing cathode loading in electrodes can cause performance depreciation, which can be alleviated by a compatible electrolyte design. In this work, a data-driven approach based on a graph-based deep learning model is adopted to screen high-performing electrolytes for a multi-electron redox-mediated Li-ICl battery and extract design rules custom to different cathode loadings. The model is trained with an experimental dataset of electrolyte formulations and battery capacity, with the inclusion of additional cell-level variables like cathode loadings. The approach brings about an additional 20% increment in the specific capacity of the battery over capacities obtained from the experimental optimization. The study resulted in an electrolyte with a high specific capacity of 250 mAh/g (at 1 mA/cm2) and excellent rate capability at the targeted 45 wt % cathode loading.}

abstract = {Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with a high burden in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia. Conventional treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy, are often limited by patient factors such as multifocal disease, poor pulmonary reserve, or central airway obstruction. This review explores bronchoscopic intratumoral injection as a novel, localized therapeutic strategy and assesses its feasibility in resource-limited settings. We conducted a narrative synthesis of recent literature on bronchoscopic intratumoral injection techniques, therapeutic agents, clinical outcomes, and implementation challenges. Additional focus was placed on the Indonesian healthcare context, particularly the infrastructure in West Sumatra. Bronchoscopic intratumoral injection delivers chemotherapeutic, immunologic, or gene-based agents directly into tumors using flexible bronchoscopy, including transbronchial needle injection, endobronchial ultrasound-guided injection, and cone-beam computed tomography. This approach achieves high local drug concentrations with minimal systemic toxicity, shifting the paradigm toward immune modulation and durable tumor control. Clinical outcomes include improved airway patency, lung function, symptom relief, and survival in patients ineligible for standard therapies. Feasibility in Indonesia is supported by existing clinical resources and agent availability. Despite challenges, such as limited access to advanced imaging, specialized equipment, and skilled personnel, bronchoscopic intratumoral injection may represent a promising investigational strategy in selected cases. Further research is warranted before routine clinical implementation can be contemplated. Strategies such as structured training and regional collaboration can bridge implementation gaps, aligning innovation with equitable lung cancer care in developing countries.
Resumen
El cáncer de pulmón sigue siendo la principal causa de mortalidad relacionada con el cáncer en el mundo, con una carga muy elevada en el Sureste Asiático, en particular en Indonesia. Los tratamientos convencionales —como la cirugía, la radioterapia y la quimioterapia sistémica— suelen verse limitados por factores asociados al paciente, como la enfermedad multifocal, la escasa reserva pulmonar o la obstrucción de las vías respiratorias centrales. En esta revisión se analiza la inyección intratumoral broncoscópica como una estrategia novedosa de tratamiento localizado y se evalúa su viabilidad en los entornos con recursos limitados. Se llevó a cabo una síntesis narrativa de la bibliografía reciente sobre las técnicas de inyección intratumoral broncoscópica, los fármacos, los resultados clínicos y las dificultades de aplicación. Se prestó especial atención al contexto sanitario indonesio, sobre todo a las infraestructuras de Sumatra Occidental. Con las inyecciones intratumorales broncoscópicas se administran antineoplásicos, inmunomoduladores o genofármacos directamente en los tumores mediante técnicas de broncoscopia flexible, como la inyección transbronquial con aguja, la inyección guiada por ecografía endobronquial y el TAC de haz cónico. De esta forma se consiguen concentraciones locales elevadas del fármaco con una toxicidad sistémica mínima, lo que supone un cambio de paradigma y permite la modulación inmunitaria y el control duradero del tumor. Los principales resultados clínicos son el aumento de la permeabilidad de las vías respiratorias, la mejora de la función pulmonar, el alivio de los síntomas y la supervivencia de pacientes que no cumplen los criterios para recibir los tratamientos habituales. La viabilidad de esta técnica en Indonesia se justifica por los recursos clínicos existentes y la disponibilidad de medicamentos. Pese a las dificultades, como el acceso limitado a las técnicas avanzadas de imagen, a los equipos especializados y al personal cualificado, la inyección intratumoral broncoscópica puede ser una estrategia experimental prometedora para casos seleccionados. Antes de proceder a su aplicación clínica sistemática es necesario realizar más estudios. Las dificultades de aplicación pueden mitigarse adoptando estrategias como la formación estructurada y la colaboración regional, para que la innovación redunde en un tratamiento del cáncer de pulmón más equitativo en los países en desarrollo.}

However, existing approaches often struggle to produce realistic and practical designs at scale. Therefore, we adapt a state-of-the-art stable diffusion model, extended with ControlNet, to generate high-fidelity satellite imagery conditioned on land use descriptions, infrastructure, and natural environments. To overcome data availability limitations, we spatially link satellite imagery with structured land use and constraint information from OpenStreetMap. Using data from three major U.S. cities, we demonstrate that the proposed diffusion model generates realistic and diverse urban landscapes by varying land-use configurations, road networks, and water bodies, facilitating cross-city learning and design diversity. We also systematically evaluate the impacts of varying language prompts and control imagery on the quality of satellite imagery generation. Our model achieves high FID and KID scores and demonstrates robustness across diverse urban contexts. Qualitative assessments from urban planners and the general public show that generated images align closely with design descriptions and constraints, and are often preferred over real images. This work establishes a benchmark for controlled urban imagery generation and highlights the potential of generative AI as a tool for enhancing planning workflows and public engagement.}

abstract = {Extensive applications have been found for rapid downscaling on meteorological wind field data in extreme weather warning, renewable energy assessment and site selection optimization, as well as dynamic simulation of nuclear accident emergency responses. This study proposes a progressive deep learning downscaling model (from 0.25° to 3 km) for generating high-resolution wind field data by integrating diffusion models with multi-head cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, a progressive diffusion framework is developed to generate high-resolution wind fields through iterative denoising of latent states initialized from Gaussian noise distributions. Compared to Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) architecture, our approach achieved approximately 32 % reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 46 % reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), while Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) was significantly improved from 0.7 to over 0.8. It is deduced that this approach significantly improves generation quality and alleviates non-physical artifacts caused by the mode collapse within Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The integration of multi-head cross-attention mechanisms and 2D Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) enables effective fusion of cross-modal information from low-resolution wind fields, terrain data, and diffusion model latent states. Ablation studies demonstrate that the attention mechanism reduced both MAE and MSE by approximately 20 %, while improving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and SSIM values. This indicates that the attention mechanisms enable the model to capture long-range spatial dependencies, significantly enhancing its representational capacity and physical consistency in spatial feature reconstruction. Additionally, to address the slow reasoning speed of traditional diffusion models, this work implements the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling algorithm to achieve deterministic latent space mapping, substantially reducing inference steps while maintaining generation accuracy. This framework ultimately realizes rapid generation of high-precision wind field data within seconds. The proposed methodology provides a novel solution for meteorological wind field downscaling, directly serving various engineering applications requiring refined meteorological data.}

But how can firms effectively utilise these advanced resources to strengthen their resilience and achieve superior performance levels? Based on the knowledge-based view (KBV), this study examines the mediating role of organisational resilience in the relationship between Gen AI-KB, intellectual capital, and organisational competitiveness and creative performance. The analysis of data from 279 Turkish manufacturing firms, using structural equation modelling (SEM), shows that both Gen AI-KB and intellectual capital significantly increase resilience, forging an important link between internal knowledge assets and firm performance. Multi-group analysis has shown that geographical contexts, such as the urban-rural divide, can significantly influence these dynamics. The findings of this study highlight the potential that generative AI and intellectual capital have to promote resilience and innovation, allowing firms to capitalise on the opportunities presented by Industry 5.0.}

abstract = {Background
Patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) demonstrated a high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its transition to acute kidney disease after diuretic therapy to reach euvolemic status. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether circulating levels of adropin predict AKI in ADHF patients after decongestive therapy.
Material and methods
A total of 325 individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria of ADHF were consecutively enrolled from October 2020 to October 2024. The study was designed as prospective cohort study. The congestion was assessed using Framingham criteria of congestion (Framingham heart failure score ≥ 2). Patients with AHDF were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of AKI (n = 113) and without AKI (n = 212). Circulating levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, high-sensitive troponin T, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2, procalcitonin were measured. Predictors of AKI were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results
We found that the presence of atrial fibrillation, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥16.5 mg/g Cr, serum levels of adropin<2.1 ng/mL and NT-proBNP ≥19,540 pmol/mL were independent predictors for AKI in patients with ADHF. UACR and atrial fibrillation revealed a strict similarity in prediction of AKI, whereas discriminative ability of adropin<2.1 ng/mL were higher to NT-proBNP ≥19,540 pmol/mL. The combined predictive model (low levels of adropin + higher levels of NT-proBNP) showed significantly better discriminatory power compared to other models.
Conclusion
Low levels of adropin<2.1 ng/mL on hospital admission in patients with ADHF can predict AKI and that its predictive ability was significantly higher compared with the conventionally used urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and NT-proBNP. Adropin may add predictive information to NT-proBNP for AKI in individuals with ADHF.}

abstract = {Background
Despite research linking chemical and physical restraints to negative outcomes including unplanned intubations and psychological distress, there is little guidance for their use in the care of trauma patients. We used institutional data to describe recent trends in chemical and physical restraint in the emergency department evaluation and treatment of trauma patients and to identify characteristics associated with their use.
Methods
This study includes adult trauma activations at a United States urban level I trauma center from January 2016 to July 2022. Data were collected from the trauma registry and medical record. We assessed the use of chemical restraints and physical restraints during care provided in the trauma resuscitation bay and emergency department. We assessed trends over time graphically and with logistic regression. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations between restraint use and patient and clinical characteristics and the outcomes of ICU admission, hospitalization duration, and mortality.
Results
Of the 8,112 patients, most were male (74.8 %), White (55.8 %), and privately insured (35.2 %). Overall, 8.1 % were restrained with 7.1 % chemically restrained and 2.7 % physically restrained. Overall restraint use increased 254 % (p < 0.001) from 2016 to 2022 driven primarily by a 460 % (p < 0.001) increase in chemical restraint use including a 630 % increase in ketamine administrations (p < 0.001). Use of restraints was associated with pre-existing psychotic disorders, intoxication, altered mental status, increasing injury severity, and Medicaid insurance (p < 0.001). Chemical restraint administration was associated with a 3.5 percentage point (95 %CI 1.1–5.9; p = 0.004) increase in the probability of ICU admission and a 1.0 day (95 %CI 0.6–1.4; p < 0.001) increase in hospitalization duration.
Conclusions
In this institutional study, nearly one-in-twelve trauma patients were restrained during emergency department evaluation and treatment. Restraint utilization increased during the study driven primarily by increases in ketamine and restraints utilized during trauma bay evaluation and resuscitation. Future research should assess the generalizability of these findings. It is important that rigorous guidelines are established to ensure the safe and effective use of restraints in trauma.}

Integral to the macrophage stress response is the recognition of hypoxia and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are often coupled. The age-specific, cell-intrinsic nature of this stress response remains vague. To uncover age-defined divergences in macrophage crosstalk potential after exposure to hypoxia and PAMPs, we interrogated the secreted proteomes of neonatal versus adult macrophages via non-biased mass spectrometry. Through this approach, we newly identified age-specific signatures in the secretomes of neonatal versus adult macrophages in response to hypoxia and the prototypical PAMP, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Neonatal macrophages secreted proteins most consistent with an anti-inflammatory, regenerative phenotype protective against apoptosis and oxidative stress, dependent on hypoxia inducible transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α). In contrast, adult macrophages secreted proteins consistent with a pro-inflammatory, glycolytic phenotypic signature consistent with pathogen killing. Taken together, these data uncover fundamental age and HIF-1α dependent macrophage responses that may be targeted to calibrate the innate immune response during stress and inflammation.}

abstract = {Lattice structures are known for their lightweight nature, excellent energy absorption, and superior thermal and acoustic insulation properties, making them ideal for applications in safety, aerospace, heat dissipation systems, and biomedical devices. With the advent of additive manufacturing, particularly laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB), the fabrication of complex lattice geometries with high precision has become feasible, which requires further investigation of their surface characteristics, microstructural behaviour, mechanical characteristics under different loading conditions, and biocompatibility. Therefore, this study was conducted to comprehensively analyze the surface integrity, mechanical responses, and biocompatibility of six distinct cellular architectures based on strut-based and sheet-based triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) topologies. The structures were designed using 3D Xpert software and manufactured using biomedical grade 316 L stainless steel (316 L SS) powder through the PBF-LB process. The dimensional analysis and surface roughness values indicated that the sheet-based structure demonstrated the closest alignment with its designed value. The XRD patterns and microstructural analysis have presented a marginal difference in the peak intensity and grain morphologies of the strut-based and sheet-based structures. Key mechanical properties, including compressive and tensile strength, high-cycle fatigue, and deformation behaviour, were systematically evaluated to compare the performance of these cellular designs. Relative density emerged as a crucial factor influencing the lattices' mechanical properties. In tensile testing, TPMS architectures outperformed strut-based counterparts in both strength and ductility. Among the strut-based lattices, the dodecahedron structure exhibited the highest ultimate tensile strength (UTS) at 83.92 MPa, while the split-p lattice from the TPMS category achieved a UTS of 307.34 MPa. The dodecahedron and split-p lattices also demonstrated exceptional resistance to both tensile and compressive loads, making them promising candidates for further study. Furthermore, the high-cycle fatigue tests revealed that the split-p lattice significantly outlasted the dodecahedron structure, enduring 317,010 cycles before failure at 0.2 σy and 48,730 cycles at 0.8 σy. Finally, the cell viability assessment showed that the dodecahedron lattice demonstrated the highest viability in the strut-based group, while the gyroid structure led among the sheet-based configurations. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the mechanical performance of strut and TPMS cellular architectures, highlighting their potential for optimization in biomedical applications where strength, durability, and weight reduction are critical.}

The HBsAg is generally present in the bloodstream of individuals with acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. It is classically known as the HBV infection marker, and is therefore the first marker to be investigated in the laboratory in the clinical hypothesis of infection by this agent. One of the factors that compromises the HBsAg detection in the bloodstream by the assays adopted in serological screening in both clinical contexts is the loss of S protein antigenicity. This can occur due to mutations that emerge in the HBV genome regions that encode the S protein, especially for its immunodominant region – the ‘a’ determinant. These mutations can induce exchanges of amino acid residues in the S protein's primary structure, altering its tertiary structure and the antigenic conformation, which may not be recognized by anti-HBs antibodies, compromising the infection diagnosis. In addition, these exchanges can render ineffective the anti-HBs antibodies action acquired by vaccination, compromise the effectiveness of the chronically HBV infected patient's treatment, and also the HBsAg immunogenicity, by promoting its retention within the cell. In this review, the residues exchange that alter the S protein's structure is revisited, as well as the mechanisms that lead to the HBsAg antigenicity loss, and the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological consequences of this phenomenon.}

Different configurations were tested such as CW type, hydraulic residence time, plants presence, and artificial aeration. Results showed that the hybrid CW configuration (i.e., vertical flow CW followed by horizontal subsurface flow CW) achieved the highest removal rates of all pollutants, i.e., more than 90% of BOD5, COD, TSS, and NH4-N. The single horizontal flow and vertical flow CW designs showed variations in the removal of NO3-N and TP (less than 30%), which were significantly improved (50% and 70%, respectively) by using the hybrid CW system. Artificial aeration significantly improves the performance of the CW system, especially for ammonia nitrogen and organic matter removal, while plants presence is also beneficial in the treatment performance. An 8-days HRT seems to be adequate for high removal rates in passive CW designs, though in aerated wetlands a lower HRT of 4 days seems sufficient. These findings suggest that the hybrid CW system could be a promising option for efficient wastewater treatment in developing regions.}

The critical pore pressure and equivalent density of the critical pore pressure for fault slip were calculated using Coulomb's law, and the influence of parameter uncertainty was evaluated. Based on the relationship between the seismic event and fault, a list of the top 10 faults with seismicity was presented. Finally, geometric data, equivalent density, seismic events, and fault relationships were integrated. Comprehensive fault hazards were evaluated using the principal component analysis method. The results revealed that the fault area in the southeast was large and the depth reached the basement. Most faults tended NE, which was in the direction of easy failure and fault slip. The F92 fault has several seismic events and releases the most energy, ranking first in the top 10 hazardous fault list. These results potentially contribute to determining shale gas well location and trajectory design and reducing seismic hazards. This study enhances our understanding of fault hazard assessments.}

abstract = {Multitargeting compounds comprising activity on more than a single biological target have gained remarkable relevance in drug discovery owing to the complexity of multifactorial diseases such as cancer, inflammation, or the metabolic syndrome. Polypharmacological drug profiles can produce additive or synergistic effects while reducing side effects and significantly contribute to the high therapeutic success of indispensable drugs such as aspirin. While their identification has long been the result of serendipity, medicinal chemistry now tends to design polypharmacology. Modern in vitro pharmacological methods and chemical probes allow a systematic search for rational target combinations and recent innovations in computational technologies, crystallography, or fragment-based design equip multitarget compound development with valuable tools. In this Perspective, we analyze the relevance of multiple ligands in drug discovery and the versatile toolbox to design polypharmacology. We conclude that despite some characteristic challenges remaining unresolved, designed polypharmacology holds enormous potential to secure future therapeutic innovation.

It can be foreseen that in the next five years, these videos and images will become more realistic and widespread. In the United States, the FBI is already handling its first cases involving the generation of AI CSAM. This paper employs a comprehensive legal analysis of existing EU laws, including the AI Act, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Digital Services Act (DSA), the proposed Child Sexual Abuse Regulation (CSAR), and the Child Sexual Abuse Directive to address the critical question of whether generative AI can be effectively policed to prevent the creation of deepfakes involving children. While EU legislation is promising, it remains limited, in particular regarding the regulation of training data used by generative AI technologies. To comprehensively address AI-generated CSAM, a proactive, effective regulation and holistic approach are required, ensuring that child protection against online CSAM is integrated into the guidelines, codes of conduct, and technical standards that bring these legal instruments to life.}

This study quantitatively assessed the impact of renal dysfunction severity, including dialysis, on clinical outcomes, resource utilization, and costs in patients with HF. Methods: Retrospective cohort study in adult patients with 1 emergency department visit or hospitalization with an HF diagnosis in a university hospital in 2018. One-year clinical outcomes, resources, and costs were compared with the Clinical Outcomes, Health care Resource Utilization, and Related Costs (COHERENT) model according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60, 30 to 59, 15 to 29, and < 15 (including patients on dialysis) mL/min/1.73 m². Results: Of 3274 patients with HF (median age, 84 years; 56% women), 1453 (44.4%) had eGFR ≥ 60. Lower eGFR levels were associated with higher 1-year mortality (20.4% in eGFR ≥ 60 vs 45.4% in eGFR 15 to 29; P < .001 for trend), rehospitalization, and new emergency department visits. Patients with eGFR < 15 had the highest readmission rate (50.8%; P < .001 for trend). Days out of hospital without dialysis decreased from 292 (80.0%) in eGFR ≥ 60 to 184 (50.3%) in eGFR < 15. Median cost per patient journey increased from 3960 (Q1-Q3, euro1750 to euro8410) with eGFR ≥ 60 to euro9590 (Q1-Q3, euro4140 to euro28 520; P < .001) with eGFR < 15, driven mainly by hospitalizations (84%-90% of total, except for eGFR < 15, 59.0%). Conclusions: Renal dysfunction severity was associated with progressively worse clinical outcomes, increased health resource utilization, and higher costs in patients with HF. Strategies are needed to improve outcomes and reduce costs in patients with HF and severe chronic kidney disease.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos: La enfermedad renal crónica es frecuente en pacientes con insuficiencia cardiaca (IC), complica su tratamiento y empeora el pronóstico. Este estudio evaluó el impacto de diferentes grados de disfunción renal, incluida la diálisis, en los resultados clínicos, el uso de recursos y los costes en pacientes con IC. Métodos: Estudio retrospectivo en pacientes con diagnóstico de IC en urgencias o ingreso en un hospital terciario durante 2018. Se compararon resultados clínicos, recursos y costes a 1 año según la tasa de filtración glomerular estimada (TFGe) ≥ 60, 30-59, 15-29 y < 15 ml/min/1,73 m2 (incluida diálisis), con el modelo Clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization and related costs (COHERENT). Resultados: De 3.274 pacientes con IC (mediana de 84 años; el 56% mujeres), 1.453 (44,4%) tenían TFGe ≥ 60. TFGe menores se asociaron a mayor mortalidad (el 20,4% en TFGe ≥ 60 y el 45,4% en TFGe 15-29; p de tendencia < 0,001), más rehospitalizaciones y nuevas visitas a urgencias. Los pacientes con TFGe < 15 presentaron la mayor tasa de reingresos (50,8%; p de tendencia < 0,001). Los días vivos fuera del hospital sin diálisis disminuyeron de 292 (80,0%) en TFGe ≥ 60 a 184 (50,3%) en TFGe < 15. El coste mediano por paciente aumentó de 3.960 euro (Q1-Q3, 1.750-8.410 euro) con TFGe ≥ 60 a 9.590 euro (Q1-Q3, 4.140-28.520 euro, p < 0,001) con TFGe < 15, impulsado principalmente por la hospitalización (el 84-90% del total, excepto en la TFGe < 15, que fue del 59,0%). Conclusiones: La enfermedad renal crónica grave en pacientes con IC se asocia con peores resultados clínicos, mayor uso de recursos y costes mucho más altos.

Drug repurposing, leveraging pre-approved antibiotics for novel applications, is a promising strategy to address this challenge. Antibiotics designed to combat bacterial infections can inhibit microbial activity and target cellular mechanisms associated with oncogenesis. Chronic bacterial infections, such as those caused by Salmonella typhi, Helicobacter pylori, and Escherichia coli, contribute significantly to gallbladder, gastric, kidney, and bladder cancers. These infections induce inflammation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, and the disruption of cellular pathways, promoting the development of cancer. Antibiotics such as doxycycline, rifampicin, and azithromycin demonstrate anticancer properties by inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and regulating key pathways such as those of interleukin (IL)-6 and autophagy. This dual action enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy and addresses bacteria-induced oncogenesis, offering a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional drug discovery. Herein, we review the intricate mechanisms by which bacteria-induced cancer arises and explore the groundbreaking potential of repurposing antibiotics as dual-action therapies in oncology. By describing the pivotal role of biofilms in persistent infections and highlighting untapped therapeutic opportunities in antibiotic repurposing, this review underscores a transformative approach to cancer treatment. This article explores the potential of repurposing antibiotic drugs for cancer treatment and highlights the prospects of drug repurposing strategies.}

abstract = {Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive subtype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that is typically resistant to nearly all current therapies. In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and dataset analyses identified Centrosomal Protein 55 (CEP55) as a critical factor in the transformation from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) to CRPC and, ultimately, NEPC. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses and validation with clinical samples demonstrated that CEP55 is significantly upregulated in NEPC tissues compared to HSPC and CRPC. Furthermore, while CEP55 does not appear to be associated with the immune microenvironment or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), our findings indicate that it directly mediates the plasticity of prostate cancer cells, thereby promoting NEPC progression. Specifically, in vivo and in vitro experiments confirmed that CEP55 enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and the expression of NEPC biomarkers in prostate cancer. Importantly, although cisplatin is the primary treatment for NEPC clinically, CEP55 has been shown to regulate cisplatin resistance through the phosphorylation of CDK1 at the tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) site. In summary, our study identifies a key gene that influences the neuroendocrine differentiation process in prostate cancer, suggesting its potential as an important therapeutic target.}

abstract = {Drilling fluids are complex suspensions of particles with a wide diameter range. While extensive research has explored the rheological behavior of drilling fluids, several limitations still exist. High-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions encountered in drilling fluids have introduced unique challenges, and only a few studies have attempted to develop a comprehensive equation that addresses both aspects concurrently. This study aims to perform a rheological characterization of a water-based drilling fluid (WBDF) containing xanthan gum under HPHT conditions and propose a constitutive equation to fit rheological data in such conditions. The experiments were conducted using an Anton Paar MCR 702TD rotational rheometer, coupled with a pressure cell. Steady-state flow curves were obtained at three different temperatures (25, 55, and 100 °C) and pressures ranging from 100 to 800 bar. The experimental data were fitted to the power-law model, and the rheological parameters of the model were fitted with variations in temperature and pressure. The fluid exhibited shear-thinning behavior, with the influence of temperature being more predominant than the effect of pressure, however, both variables have a strong relationship. Furthermore, we proposed a methodology to establish an equation capable of predicting the shear stress of the drilling fluid under HPHT conditions. The equation was also compared with different drilling fluids tested on different rheometers. This equation demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy within the fitted range. The insights provided in this study hold substantial implications for the oil and gas industry, as predicting the rheological behavior of drilling fluids under varying temperatures and pressures within the annular region of the well is essential for efficient drilling planning, particularly in offshore fields.}

abstract = {HIV-1 can rapidly infect the brain upon initial infection, establishing latent reservoirs that induce neuronal damage and/or death, resulting in HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder. Though anti-HIV-1 antiretrovirals (ARVs) suppress viral load, the blood-brain barrier limits drug access to the brain, largely because of highly expressed efflux proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gp). While no FDA-approved P-gp inhibitor currently exists, HIV-1 protease inhibitors show promise as partial P-gp inhibitors, potentially enhancing drug delivery to the brain. Herein, we employed docking and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate key differences in P-gp’s interactions with several antiretrovirals, including protease inhibitors, with known inhibitory or substrate-like behaviors towards P-gp. Our results led us to hypothesize new mechanistic details of small-molecule efflux by and inhibition of P-gp, where the “Lower Pocket” in P-gp’s transmembrane domain serves as the primary initial site for small-molecule binding. Subsequently, this pocket merges with the more traditionally studied drug binding site—the “Upper Pocket”—thus funneling small-molecule drugs, such as ARVs, towards the Upper Pocket for efflux. Furthermore, our results reinforce the understanding that both binding energetics and changes in protein dynamics are crucial in discerning small molecules as non-substrates, substrates, or inhibitors of P-gp. Our findings indicate that interactions between P-gp and inhibitory ARVs induce bridging of transmembrane domain helices, impeding P-gp conformational changes and contributing to the inhibitory behavior of these ARVs. Overall, insights gained in this study could serve to guide the design of future P-gp-targeting therapeutics for a wide range of pathological conditions and diseases, including HIV-1.}

This research aims to contribute to this knowledge by assessing the effect of temperature and water availability along the growing cycle on grape quality and in particular on the phenolic compounds and their extractability. The research was carried out in a commercial vineyard in La Mancha Designation of Origen (Spain) planted with Merlot. Edaphoclimatic characteristics and the grape composition at maturity were evaluated for several years in the period 2007–2017. An increase in temperature decreased the content of phenolic compounds, while higher water availability contributed to increase their levels in the grapes. Total anthocyanin content was mainly affected by minimum temperature before veraison while extractable anthocyanin, flavonols and total polyphenols were affected by both maximum and minimum temperature during ripening. Higher water availability decreased the concentration of anthocyanins but favoured their extractability, while flavonols were not significantly affected by water availability. Thus, phenolic ripening can be affected by changes in temperature and water distribution throughout the growing cycle, but due to the opposite sign of their effect they may be partially balanced. The projected warmer conditions can affect phenolic composition of Merlot and therefore quality of the wines made with such variety. In order to maintain grape quality, strategies to reduce heat stress should be adopted, and irrigation doses and timing should be adapted not only in the ripening period but also in the period prior to veraison.}

Practical industrial process data are mostly nonlinear, dynamical, and manifested as temporal correlation, which makes it challenging for traditional monitoring methods to accurately capture the changes in internal state variables. To this end, a multi-block whitening slow feature analysis (MBW-SFA) approach is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the cross maximum information coefficient (CMIC) for nonlinear correlation analysis, blocking, as well as selective whitening transformation (SWT) for the nonlinear and strongly coupled process variables, so as to avoid the information loss caused by global whitening. The proposed MBW-SFA approach performs manifold mapping on the data with strong correlations, preserving key information while reducing dimensionality, and the selective whitening transformation is applied to prevent information loss across different variables. In addition, for scenarios involving partially known fault data, this study proposes a control limit optimization (CLO) function that balances fault identification and false alarms to calculate control limit thresholds based on slow feature monitoring statistics, achieving objective monitoring of industrial processes. The proposed approach is experimentally validated on Tennessee Eastman process, where the correlation between process variables is investigated, and the results show that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in process monitoring.}

Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays.

abstract = {Background
Cataract surgeries are among the most performed surgeries worldwide. A thorough patient education is essential to inform patients about the perioperative process and postoperative target results concerning the intraocular lens and objectives for visual outcomes. However, addressing all relevant aspects and questions is time-consuming. Mobile apps can facilitate this process for both patients and physicians and thus be beneficial. However, the success of such an app depends on its user friendliness and acceptance by patients.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the user friendliness and acceptance of a cataract surgery education app on mobile devices among patients undergoing cataract surgery, the characteristics of patients who benefit the most from app use, and the influence of the app on patient satisfaction with treatment.
Methods
All patients who underwent cataract surgery at an ophthalmological practice from August 2020 to July 2021 were invited to participate in this randomized controlled trial. Out of 493 invited patients, 297 (60.2%) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized into 3 different groups. Half of the patients were offered to participate in Group 1 with use of the “Patient Journey” app. However, if they decided not to use the app, they were included in Group 2 (app denial). The other half of the patients were included in Group 3 (control) with no use of the app and with information provided conventionally. The app provided general information on the ophthalmological center, surgeons, cataract, and treatment options. Different questionnaires were used in all 3 groups to evaluate satisfaction with the perioperative process. Group 1 evaluated the app. Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and educational degree, were assessed.
Results
Group 1 included 77 patients (median age 69 years). Group 2 included 61 patients, and their median age was higher (median age 79 years). Group 3 included 159 patients (median age 74 years). There was no difference in satisfaction with the perioperative process and clinic between the 3 groups. Almost all app users appreciated the digital details provided for the organization and the information on the surgery. Age did not play a major role in appreciation of the app. Female patients tended to appreciate the information provided more than male patients. Patients who did not have a higher university degree experienced more benefits from the informational content of the app and were the most satisfied with the information. However, male patients and academics were in general more aware of technology and handled the app more easily.
Conclusions
The app showed high user friendliness and acceptance, and could particularly benefit specific patient groups. App users demonstrated a noninferior high satisfaction with the treatment in the ophthalmological center in comparison with patients who were informed about the surgery only conventionally.}

abstract = {Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is essential for battery safe and efficient utilization. As artificial intelligence technologies evolve, data-driven methods have become mainstream for estimating SOC. However, the technique can significantly deteriorate model performance when encountering poor or insufficient data quality. In this paper, we apply median filtering to eliminate extreme noise and utilize continuous wavelet transform to extract time-frequency features from voltage signals. Additionally, we generate novel features via feature crossing. We then apply dimensionality reduction via the random forest method to decrease computational expense. Finally, we select a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the base model to learn optimized features for more precise SOC estimation. To confirm the efficacy of our proposed method, this study compares it with CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BILSTM), and a CNN-BILSTM model combined with an attention mechanism. These comparisons are conducted under different temperatures and operating conditions. The results indicate that this method achieves a mean absolute error and a root mean square error of less than 2.89 % and 3.71 %, respectively, in SOC estimation, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to other models. This study underscores the significance of feature engineering techniques in SOC estimation.}

abstract = {Benzophenone (BP) scaffold, owing to its highly applicable photo-related properties, has been widespread among many branches of chemical research and industry. While the benzophenone molecule itself has been extensively studied towards the intrinsic mechanisms standing behind its prominent nature, yet its derivatives still tend to be under-explored in this particular regard. Coming across the disclosed imparity, throughout the present paper, a subject of rotational isomerism, anticipated to affect the BP frameworks substituted in the ortho position, is thoroughly investigated. In this respect, a bunch of ortho derivatives of BP are subjected to a systematic analysis carried out via both in silico DFT modeling and spectroscopic measurements (IR, UV–Vis). The obtained results show that the effect of rotamerism indeed applies to the studied group of compounds, as some of them reveal themselves in the form of multiple coexisting conformational isomers. What is more, as the indicated conformers are found to be characterized by substantially different emission profiles, the foregoing phenomenon is disclosed to have quite a remarkable impact onto the photoluminescence of the explored o-BP molecules.}
