abstract = {Introduction
Baihu Jia Renshen Decoction is composed of Gypsum Fibrosum, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Oryza Sativa L., Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma. It is recommended by five guidelines in China for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, evaluations of its efficacy involve a diverse range of outcomes. This multi-method study aims to identify clinical outcomes that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners consider both predictive of T2DM progression and responsive to the formula, and to explore the herbal formula’s mechanisms of action on these outcomes.
Methods
We searched eight databases and collated clinical outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials, as well as signs and symptoms of clinical response listed in TCM clinical guidelines. A panel of eight TCM clinicians participated in three rounds of Delphi surveys to select the most important outcomes. Finally, overlapping genes between responsive outcomes-related genes and the targets of formula were obtained. Based on the enrichment analysis results, the“herb-compound-target-pathway-outcome” relationship was constructed to show how the formula affect clinical outcomes.
Results
Seventy-six outcomes were shortlisted from the literature, from which consensus was reached in the Delphi survey on eight. These were xerostomia, polydipsia, preference for cold drinks, red tongue, dry tongue, tongue coating dryness, large pulse and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Fifteen overlapping gene targets were identified. Based on enrichment analysis, we hypothesized that diosgenin, nicotinic acid, and anhydroicaritin from Anemarrhenae Rhizoma may act on SOD1, PPARGC1A, CHRM3, modulating AMPK signaling pathway and thereby influencing xerostomia and tongue dryness. The 29 components were found to act on PPARG, PPARGC1A, SHBG, etc, regulating insulin signaling pathway and the AMPK signaling pathway, ultimately affecting FBG.
Conclusion
Based on the network pharmacology studies, the potential mechanisms of action of Baihu Jia Renshen Decoction on the eight core clinical outcomes are as follows. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma may regulate dryness of the tongue and xerostomia. Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma may modulate FBG levels. Further research is needed to explore the formula’s mechanisms of action for the remaining five outcomes and T2DM.}

abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) categorizes postpartum depression (PPD) as a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with peripartum onset, generally arising within the initial trimester following delivery. This acute psychiatric condition is characterized by feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, extreme anxiety, or maternal neglect. Intranasal oxytocin (OT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have the potential to address impaired social cognition; nonetheless, their neuronal underpinnings, along with their safety and efficacy, are little comprehended. This study examines the effects of rTMS stimulation with an oxytocin agonist or antagonist in a PPD model. We employed the maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) strategy for 21 days to attain our objective. Oxytocin acetate (agonist) and atosiban (antagonist) were administered by injection twice daily for three consecutive days following the model according to the established protocol. A single session of rTMS involved the application of high-frequency stimulation (20 Hz) one hour following the final injection. Behavioral testing and brain collection were conducted 12 h post-rTMS. The results indicated that treatment with OT followed by rTMS stimulation decreased neuronal cell death and microglial activation, meanwhile enhancing synaptic plasticity through the upregulation of PSD95, Synapsin I, and Synaptophysin. Simultaneously, both OT therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation demonstrated a significant capacity to alter autophagy activity and astrocyte function. Nonetheless, OTA therapy followed by rTMS did not exhibit the same pattern of outcomes. Our findings indicate that the combination of rTMS stimulation and an oxytocin agonist in a PPD model may mitigate depression-like behavior.}

This study describes the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Tunisian pediatric population during successive waves. A total of 447 complete sequences were obtained from individuals aged from 13 days to 18 years, between March 2020 and September 2022: 369 sequences generated during this study and 78 ones, available in GISAID, previously obtained from Tunisian pediatric patients. These sequences were compared with 354 and 274 ones obtained from Tunisian adults and a global dataset, respectively. The variant circulation dynamics of predominant variants were investigated during the study period using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis. Among the studied population, adolescents were the predominant age group, comprising 55.26% of cases. Twenty-three lineages were identified; seven of which were not previously reported in Tunisia. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between the sequences from Tunisian adults and children. The connections of sequences from other countries were variable according to variants: close relationships were observed for Alpha, B1.160 and Omicron variants, while independent Tunisian clusters were observed for Delta and B.1.177 lineages. These findings highlight the pivotal role of children in virus transmission and underscore the impact of vaccination on virus spread. Vaccination of children, with booster doses, may be considered for better management of future emergences.}

Although 2D CT images provide valuable pore-scale data, the scarcity of real-world datasets limits the effectiveness of advanced analysis. Generative AI presents a promising approach for synthesizing high-quality rock images but faces key challenges, including high computational demands, insufficient evaluation metrics, and the trade-off between image fidelity and diversity. To address these limitations, this study proposes the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning stable diffusion models, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining image quality. A systematic investigation was conducted to evaluate the influence of LoRA training parameters, including rank and learning rate, on the quality of generated images. Image outputs were assessed using both standard generative metrics, such as Kernel Inception Distance (KID), and domain-specific metrics, including porosity, pore count, and pore area distributions. The optimised LoRA-enhanced diffusion model achieved a 92.6 % reduction in KID relative to baseline models, while also improving inference speed. Building on these advancements, this study demonstrates that the LoRA-enhanced diffusion model significantly improves neural network extrapolation in incomplete data scenarios through statistically consistent synthetic generation. Despite control challenges, this approach reduces costs and enables diverse applications, bridging fundamental rock physics with practical energy research.}

Our research in the Yellow River Delta watershed focused on two rivers, Shenxian Gou and Tiao He, representing the impacts of oil extraction and urban wastewater, respectively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of PFCs on the microbial community structure and to investigate the mechanisms of their degradation by microorganisms. The results suggested that the microbial communities were influenced by the combined effects of PFCs concentration and water quality (0.33), with a notable emphasis on the impact of PFCs (0.28). The 16S rDNA gene amplicon data revealed significant variations in both the structural composition and functional aspects of microbial communities across different concentrations of PFCs (p < 0.05). In particular, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was found to interfere with several microbial metabolic functions, including DNA functions, structural pathways, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Certain bacteria, such as Hydrogenophaga, Luteolibacter, and Pseudorhodobacter, were found to synergistically promote perfluorooctanoic acid degradation. The results improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which microbes adapt to and degrade PFCs in different environments and the complex effects PFCs have on ecosystems.}

Accumulating evidence supports their efficacy in improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and potentially enhancing graft and patient survival across diverse transplant populations. Notably, GLP-1RAs exhibit a favorable safety profile, with minimal risk of drug interactions or rejection. Early data also suggest immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits. Moreover, newer dual and triple incretin agonists offer enhanced metabolic efficacy, potentially extending these benefits further. While long-term outcomes remain under investigation, GLP-1RAs represent a compelling therapeutic option that may reshape metabolic management paradigms in both pre- and post-transplant care.}

Based on the mobile app data, a GIS automated regionalization method is used to define regions of various urbanicity levels. The variability of HFMD patients’ travel behaviors across these regions are examined by the complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDFs). The travel burden in Nanchang increased as the patients’ residences moved toward regions of more rurality. Specifically, more urbanized regions near the city center (i.e., urban core and its surrounding urban) enjoyed better access to the healthcare service by spending an average of about 17-minute drive time. Patients residing in less urbanized regions such as suburbs and downtowns of surrounding rural counties either chose a nearby hospital or journeyed far to the region’s central Children’s Hospital, with average elevated travel time of 25 and 22 min, respectively. Those in rural areas travelled an average of 36 min, the longest among all regions. The study also finds a unique dual-peak pattern across two travel ranges in the study area due to the patients’ dilemma between pursuing high-quality hospitals and accommodating travel burden. Such a pattern mandates the adoption of a segmented regression approach to deriving the best-fitting CCDFs in most regions except for the rural.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Chinese medicine injections (CMIs) in treating diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (Dia-LEAD). However, with the variety of CMIs available, it has become challenging to determine the optimal choice for Dia-LEAD patients. This study aims to compare and rank the efficacy of CMIs for Dia-LEAD to provide references and evidence for clinicians in optimising drug selection.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CMIs for treating Dia-LEAD, which included the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, China Weipu Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science, covering inception to 15 October 2023. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 to assess bias risk, and RevMan 5.4.1, GeMTC, STATA 13.0, and R 4.2.1 for statistical analysis and visualization of the network meta-analysis.
Results
We analysed 38 studies with 12 CMIs. Compared with other interventions, Shuxuening injection (SXN) + conventional treatment (CT) was superior in terms of the total effective rate (surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) 86.2 %). Danshen injection (DS) + CT ranked first in improving the ankle-brachial index (ABI) (SUCRA 95.1 %) and dorsalis pedis artery blood flow (DPABF) (SUCRA 88.8 %). Danhong injection (DH) + CT showed the highest probability of effectiveness in improving the plasma viscosity (SUCRA 91.6 %). Chuanxiongqin injection (CXQ) + CT yielded favourable results in regulating fibrinogen levels (SUCRA 77.1 %). Furthermore, no significant differences in adverse reactions were detected between the treatment and control groups.
Conclusion
The study demonstrated that CMIs have potential as a complementary therapy for treating Dia-LEAD, and it supports the positive effects of combining CMIs with CT on a number of outcome indicators. Especially when it comes to improving the haemodynamics indices and the haemorheology indices, DS in combination with CT may be a more effective intervention. However, further confirmation in more rigorous, high-quality, and multicentre RCTs is needed to strengthen the validity and generalisability of the results.}

It is well established that the level of acceptance of these materials influences learning outcomes, but there is lack of evidence regarding the use and related impact of videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) on these aspects. This paper used linear mixed models and path analysis to investigate the influence of student acceptance of AI-generated short videos on learning outcomes compared to paper-based materials. Student acceptance was assessed based on perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (A), intentions (I), and concentration (C). The results indicate that both AI-generated short videos and paper-based materials can significantly enhance learning outcomes. AI-generated short videos are more likely to be accepted by students with lower pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at higher levels. On the other hand, paper-based materials are more likely to be accepted by students with higher pre-test scores and may lead to more significant learning outcomes when PEU, PU, A, I and C are at lower levels. These findings offer empirical evidence supporting the use of AI-generated short videos in FLL and provide suggestions for selecting appropriate learning materials in different FLL contexts.}

Following initial evaluation, ejaculates of each collection session from the same bucks were pooled, diluted (1:10) with glycerolized (3 % glycerol, v/v) tris-citric acid egg yolk diluent and were split into three aliquots. The first aliquot served as control, whereas the second and third aliquots were supplemented with 4 μL/mL L-carnitine and 400 μL/mL moringa leaves extract (v/v), respectively. Thereafter, all specimens were processed for cryopreservation and were stored in liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) for 12 months before post-thaw sperm criteria were analyzed by a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system. Integrity of sperm DNA post thawing was visualized in all semen groups by fluorescence imaging, and in vitro fertilization ability of spermatozoa was also determined. Inclusion of L-carnitine or moringa leaves extract into the diluent improved (P<0.05) post-thaw sperm physical, morphofunctional and kinematic attributes, whilst maintaining (P<0.05) integrity of sperm DNA throughout the freezing and thawing cycle. Consequently, both supplemented groups yielded higher (P<0.05) in vitro fertilization rates compared to control. These results accentuate the protective roles of these antioxidants on buck sperm against consequences of cryopreservation-induced oxidative stress, hence ameliorating post-thaw sperm quality and fertilization competence.

Despite efforts to utilize street view imagery (SVI) for auditing perceived safety in urban areas, most studies remain analytical, with limited integration into urban design's form-based ideation workflow. The reason is mechanism dependency: few designers use both analytics (Python) and form-based design (Rhino) tools fluently. The outcome should not be overlooked: when the humanistic pedestrian experience cannot be explicitly integrated into the design process, the planning results may further marginalise disadvantaged groups. To bridge the gap between urban analytics and design, we propose a computational framework that automates the evaluation of pedestrian-oriented perceived safety in real-time, linking form-based urban design features, particularly greenery, to visual safety perception within urban canyons. By integrating datasets such as Place Pulse 2.0 and environmental attributes, the perceived safety of different urban canyons with varying urban forms and streetscape configurations can be seamlessly updated using machine learning in Rhino Grasshopper. Our tests show that in areas with the same urban density and height-width ratio, specific greenery configurations, such as tree density and green coverage, significantly improve perceived safety. Subsequently, urban canyon forms are categorised based on perceived safety outcomes to provide urban design guidelines. Notably, real-time visualisations from Stable Diffusion are further incorporated to improve the Rhino-based framework's usability in real life. This computational framework integrates visual perceptions into form-based urban form ideation (especially greenery characteristics): it alleviates the politics of difference in urban design practice, supporting the facilitation of more inclusive public spaces.}

Clinimetric evaluation study.
Introduction
The Chinese Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire has necessitated the development of a revised version to the specific needs of individuals with upper extremity injuries with the progress of times and lifestyle changes.
Purpose of the study
This research aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of Modified Chinese Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (MC-DASH) questionnaire in individuals with upper extremity injuries.
Methods
One hundred and one individuals with upper extremity injuries (UEI) were recruited. The function of upper extremity was measured using the electronic version of MC-DASH, and compared against the Chinese Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand. The MC-DASH was reassessed within three days in all individuals. We investigated the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity of MC-DASH.
Results
The internal consistency was deemed sufficient, as indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.986 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.957. Moreover, the mean total scores of MC-DASH on the first-test and retest were 37.86 and 38.19, respectively (ICC: 0.957, 95 %CI: 0.937–0.971, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the MC-DASH version exhibited satisfactory content validity evidenced by its strong correlation (R= 0.903, p < 0.001) with the Chinese DASH. Three major influencing factors were identified from 37 items. The cumulative variance contribution rate of the MC-DASH questionnaire was 75.76 %, confirming its construct validity.
Conclusion
The Modified Chinese Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire has been shown to be a valid, reliable, and practical tool for use in patients with upper extremity injuries.}

abstract = {Research in machine learning (ML) algorithms using natural behavior (i.e., text, audio, and video data) suggests that these techniques could contribute to personalization in psychology and psychiatry. However, a systematic review of the current state of the art is missing. Moreover, individual studies often target ML experts who may overlook potential clinical implications of their findings. In a narrative accessible to mental health professionals, we present a systematic review conducted in 5 psychology and 2 computer science databases. We included 128 studies that assessed the predictive power of ML algorithms using text, audio, and/or video data in the prediction of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder. Most studies (n = 87) were aimed at predicting anxiety, while the remainder (n = 41) focused on posttraumatic stress disorder. They were mostly published since 2019 in computer science journals and tested algorithms using text (n = 72) as opposed to audio or video. Studies focused mainly on general populations (n = 92) and less on laboratory experiments (n = 23) or clinical populations (n = 13). Methodological quality varied, as did reported metrics of the predictive power, hampering comparison across studies. Two-thirds of studies, which focused on both disorders, reported acceptable to very good predictive power (including high-quality studies only). The results of 33 studies were uninterpretable, mainly due to missing information. Research into ML algorithms using natural behavior is in its infancy but shows potential to contribute to diagnostics of mental disorders, such as anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, in the future if standardization of methods, reporting of results, and research in clinical populations are improved.}

abstract = {Objectives
To systematically evaluate the performance of COVID-19 prognostic models and scores for mortality risk in older populations across three health-care settings: hospitals, primary care, and nursing homes.
Study Design and Setting
This retrospective external validation study included 14,092 older individuals of ≥70 years of age with a clinical or polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 2020 to December 2020. The six validation cohorts include three hospital-based (CliniCo, COVID-OLD, COVID-PREDICT), two primary care-based (Julius General Practitioners Network/Academisch network huisartsgeneeskunde/Network of Academic general Practitioners, PHARMO), and one nursing home cohort (YSIS) in the Netherlands. Based on a living systematic review of COVID-19 prediction models using Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool for quality and risk of bias assessment and considering predictor availability in validation cohorts, we selected six prognostic models predicting mortality risk in adults with COVID-19 infection (GAL-COVID-19 mortality, 4C Mortality Score, National Early Warning Score 2-extended model, Xie model, Wang clinical model, and CURB65 score). All six prognostic models were validated in the hospital cohorts and the GAL-COVID-19 mortality model was validated in all three healthcare settings. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home settings. Model performance was evaluated in each validation cohort separately in terms of discrimination, calibration, and decision curves. An intercept update was performed in models indicating miscalibration followed by predictive performance re-evaluation.
Main Outcome Measure
In-hospital mortality for hospitals and 28-day mortality for primary care and nursing home setting.
Results
All six prognostic models performed poorly and showed miscalibration in the older population cohorts. In the hospital settings, model performance ranged from calibration-in-the-large −1.45 to 7.46, calibration slopes 0.24–0.81, and C-statistic 0.55–0.71 with 4C Mortality Score performing as the most discriminative and well-calibrated model. Performance across health-care settings was similar for the GAL-COVID-19 model, with a calibration-in-the-large in the range of −2.35 to −0.15 indicating overestimation, calibration slopes of 0.24–0.81 indicating signs of overfitting, and C-statistic of 0.55–0.71.
Conclusion
Our results show that most prognostic models for predicting mortality risk performed poorly in the older population with COVID-19, in each health-care setting: hospital, primary care, and nursing home settings. Insights into factors influencing predictive model performance in the older population are needed for pandemic preparedness and reliable prognostication of health-related outcomes in this demographic.}

abstract = {Background
Brief psychosocial interventions, such as the Healthy Activity Program (HAP), which are based on behavioral activation and delivered by nonspecialist providers (NSPs), have emerged as cost-effective solutions for the treatment of depression. HAP treatment outcomes are improved by the engagement of patients in activation-focused homework assignments and their adherence to these assignments during therapy. Currently, patients are expected to complete these homework assignments using a paper workbook.
Objective
The aim of this study was to describe the user-centered development process of PracticePal, a chatbot designed to enhance patient engagement and homework adherence, and to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability as a therapy aid in India.
Methods
We used a user-centered approach to co-develop PracticePal, incorporating conversational flows and video scripts in Hindi. The chatbot was piloted with 30 participants having depression who were receiving the HAP from 15 nonspecialist counselors in primary care in rural Madhya Pradesh, India. The feasibility and acceptability of PracticePal were assessed through engagement data, in-depth interviews with a subset of 6 participants, and focus group discussions with 11 counselors. Treatment completion rates and changes in depressive symptoms were explored as secondary outcomes.
Results
Average patient engagement spanned 29 days (95% CI 24-34) during the 60-day treatment period. The engagement of patients with PracticePal increased as their treatment progressed, particularly after the third HAP session. Of the 30 patients, 20 (67%) accessed more than half of the multimedia content available on the chatbot. On average, there was a greater frequency of self-initiated engagement (1558 out of a total of 1835 times, 84.9%) across all sessions compared with reminder prompts (277 out of 1835 times, 15.1%). All 30 patients completed treatment and experienced a reduction in the mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score from 13 (95% CI 12.6-13.6; signifying moderate severity) to 4 (95% CI 2.9-4.7; signifying none/minimal severity). Patients found the chatbot’s reminders for activities, mood tracking, and video messages helpful and observed that it could help others in their social network. NSPs also reported improved participation of patients in the homework tasks compared with the paper workbook. A few patients faced challenges with low internet bandwidth, and those with limited literacy suggested increasing the amount of video content for easier accessibility.
Conclusions
The PracticePal chatbot is a feasible and acceptable therapy aid to complement a psychological treatment, with promising potential to enhance the effectiveness of NSP-delivered psychosocial interventions in low-resource settings. Future steps include conducting a fully powered randomized controlled trial to assess its effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes.}

abstract = {Purpose
Tracheostomy care is supply- and resource-intensive, and airway-related adverse events in community settings have high rates of readmission and mortality. Devices are often implicated in harm, but little is known about insurance coverage, gaps, and barriers to obtaining tracheostomy-related medically necessary durable medical equipment. We aimed to identify barriers patients may encounter in procuring tracheostomy-related durable medical equipment through insurance plan coverage.
Materials and methods
Tracheostomy-related durable medical equipment provisions were evaluated across insurers, extracting data via structured telephone interviews and web-based searches. Each insurance company was contacted four times and queried iteratively regarding the range of coverage and co-pay policies. Outcome measures include call duration, consistency of explanation of benefits, and the number of transfers and disconnects. We also identified six qualitative themes from patient interviews.
Results
Tracheostomy-related durable medical equipment coverage was offered in some form by 98.1 % (53/54) of plans across 11 insurers studied. Co-pays or deductibles were required in 42.6 % (23/54). There was significant variability in out-of-pocket expenditures. Fixed co-pays ranged from $0–30, and floating co-pays ranged from 0 to 40 %. During phone interviews, mean call duration was 19 ± 10 min, with an average of 2 ± 1 transfers between agents. Repeated calls revealed high information variability (mean score 2.4 ± 1.5). Insurance sites proved challenging to navigate, scoring poorly on usability, literacy, and information quality.
Conclusions
Several factors may limit access to potentially life-saving durable medical equipment for patients with tracheostomy. Barriers include out-of-pocket expenditures, lack of transparency on coverage, and low-quality information. Further research is necessary to evaluate patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Peanut production in Argentina is predominantly rainfed, with considerable variability in rainfall patterns within and between seasons. This variability results in droughts of varying duration and severity, which can significantly reduce yields. Water availability is, therefore, a critical factor in determining the optimal sowing date. The objectives of this study were to (i) assess the effects of sowing dates and water gradients on peanut yield and crop traits at two representative sites in the central peanut-producing region, and (ii) identify management strategies that optimize yield under water-limited conditions. Seasonal and annual analyses were conducted, incorporating water availability at sowing, environmental conditions, site characteristics, management practices, and cultivars. The Cropping System Model CROPGRO-Peanut was employed to simulate the impacts of those factors. Seasonal analysis revealed that delayed sowing dates consistently led to yield reductions, irrespective of water availability, with decreases in seed number, maximum leaf area index, total biomass, and water use efficiency. These yield reductions were more pronounced under lower water availability at sowing. When sown late, annual analysis indicated that combining an early cultivar and progressively narrowing row spacing resulted in increased yields. In contrast, intermediate-cycle and late cultivars experienced yield declines due to lower radiation and temperature levels. Differences in yield were also explained by the varying contributions of transpiration and evaporation to total water use. Our findings underscore the importance of management decisions in influencing water use components, with soil water-holding capacity playing a key role in crop performance. This study provides valuable insights for developing adapted management practices to improve productivity in temperate regions under water-limited conditions.}

The study formulated a research model grounded in Expectation Confirmation Theory, specifically examining the role of e-commerce experience in customer satisfaction and loyalty within the context of Pinduoduo. Hypothesized relationships were established between the core dimensions of e-commerce experience and the e-commerce customer engagement triad. To analyze the gathered data and evaluate the research hypotheses, structural equation modeling was employed. The research findings indicate that the core dimensions of e-commerce experience, namely e-commerce user interface quality, information quality, security risk avoidance perception, and privacy perception, exert positive influences on both customer satisfaction and trust. Moreover, the study reveals a positive relationship between customer satisfaction, trust, and customer loyalty. These findings have significant implications for e-commerce platform operators, highlighting the importance of enhancing customer experiences and building stronger customer relationships through targeted improvements in these critical factors.}

abstract = {Background
Stigma associated with HIV/AIDS continues to be a major barrier to prevention, management, and care. HIV stigma can negatively influence health behaviors. Surveys of the general public in Japan also demonstrated substantial gaps in knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Tweets from the social networking service X (formerly known as Twitter) have been studied to identify stigmas in other disorders but have not yet been used to study HIV stigma in Japan.
Objective
The aim of the study is to examine the variations in stigma related to HIV over an extended period using tweets from X and to investigate the stigma toward people with HIV associated with various demographic segments.
Methods
Japanese tweets from X related to HIV/AIDS were retrospectively collected; the phase 1 feasibility study collected tweets from 2011, 2014, and 2017, and the phase 2 analysis included tweets from each third year from 2011 through 2023. Individual tweets were labeled with the messages they conveyed (stigma and corresponding antistigma types included labels, marks, responsibility, peril, insults, and fear; tweets without stigma or antistigma messages were considered general education or neutral) along with demographic characteristics and locations; phase 1 results were used to develop a machine learning model to apply in phase 2. The labeled data from phase 2 were used to answer research questions concerning yearly changes in HIV stigma and proportions of stigma across population segments.
Results
A total of 2,016,826 tweets related to HIV/AIDS were identified over the study period; 1,648,556 (81.7%) were from individual accounts, with the remainder from organizational accounts. In total, 574,687 (28.5%) tweets indicated stigma attitudes, while 1,119,852 (55.5%), 207,320 (10.3%), and 114,967 (5.7%) showed neutral, antistigma, or general education attitudes, respectively. Tweets including peril, fear, or insult comprised 502,134 (87.4%) of tweets with stigma. The greatest numbers of tweets were made by people in their 20s, whereas people in their 20s and 60s had the greatest proportions of tweets with stigma (n=9650, 35.3% and n=558, 34.5%, respectively). Peril and fear made up 5819 (60.3%) of stigma tweets from people in their 20s. The proportion of tweets with stigma (n=59,719, 20.5% in 2017) increased notably during the COVID-19 pandemic (n=217,512, 31.4% in 2020, and a similar n=175,647, 33.9% in 2023). Tweets from health care practitioners had 1.68 times the odds of having antistigma messages versus those from others.
Conclusions
This study contributes to the understanding of HIV stigma in Japan and shows the usefulness of social media for studying stigma. The extent and type of HIV stigma changed from before to after the COVID-19 pandemic. These results can be used to develop future activities and educational programs to combat HIV-related stigma.}

A rarely discussed phenomenon, though gaining importance considering the increasing number of real-life use cases, is using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. By manipulating visualizations, artificial intelligence (AI) allows politicians to eliminate or minimize the deficits of their performance and highlight or create features perceived as attractive by the audience. Such manipulations pose a significant epistemic problem, and can severely distort perception of real politicians and their characteristics. These disruptions might correspond to the classic “Ship of Theseus” paradox that addresses the problem of changing identity. The aim of this study is to analyze how this philosophical conundrum could be used for crafting better transparency obligations (disclaimers) for using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. The aim of such disclaimers is to sensitize and protect public opinion against manipulation. However, at the moment the basic labels concentrate on technological dimension of manipulation, overlooking cognitive consequences for human audiences. This paper proposes extensive disclaimers to strengthen their informative and sensitizing potential.}

We further examined how consumer decision-making styles (intuitive vs. rational) and user interfaces (text-based vs. voice-based) moderated these effects. Results show that post hoc explanations enhance perceived transparency and interpretability, thereby increasing consumer trust in conversational recommendations. In text-based interfaces, consumers making hedonic decisions preferred consensus-based explanations, whereas no clear preference emerged for utilitarian decision-makers. In voice-based interfaces, utilitarian consumers favored consensus-based explanations, while no significant preference was observed for hedonic decisions. Furthermore, intuitive consumers preferred consensus-based explanations for hedonic decisions and expert-based explanations for utilitarian decisions. Rational consumers consistently favored consensus-based explanations across both decision-making domains. These findings provide valuable insights for designing conversational recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms. By tailoring explanations to decision domains, user interfaces, and consumer decision-making styles, businesses can foster greater trust and engagement, driving more favorable purchasing behaviors and improving business outcomes.}

abstract = {Although the xylose mutarotation and transformation have been investigated largely separately, their relationship has been rarely systematically elaborated. The effect of several factors such as xylose concentration, temperature, and salt concentration, affecting the mutarotation of xylose are discussed. Nine alkali halides (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, LiBr, NaBr, KBr, LiI, NaI, and KI) are used to test salt effects. The relationship between xylose rotation rate constant (kM), specific optical rotation at equilibrium ([α]eqm), α/β ratio, H chemical shift difference (ΔΔδ), Gibbs free energy difference (ΔG), hydrogen ion or hydroxide ion concentration ([H+] or [OH−]), and xylose conversion is discussed. Different salts dissolved in water result in different pH of the solutions, which affect the mutarotation of xylose, with the nature of both cation and anion. Shortly, the smaller the cation radius is and the larger the anion radius is, the greater the mutarotation rate is. In the dehydration of xylose to furfural in salty solutions, xylose conversion is positively correlated to mutarotation rate, H+ or OH− concentration, and the energy difference between α-xylopyranose and β-xylopyranose. Although the [α]eqm of xylose is positively correlated with α/β configuration ratio, there is no obvious correlation with xylose dehydration. The conversion to furfural in chlorides is superior to that in bromines and iodides, which is due to the fact that the pH of chloride salts is smaller than that of the corresponding bromide and iodized salts. Higher H+ concentration prefers to accelerate the formation of furfural. In basic salt solutions, the xylulose selectivity is higher than that of furfural at the initial stage of reaction. The furfural selectivity and carbon balance are better in acidic condition rather than in basic condition. In H2O-MTHF (2-Methyltetrahydrofuran) biphasic system, the optimal furfural selectivity of 81.0 % is achieved at 190 °C in 1 h with the assistance of LiI and a little HCl (0.2 mmol, 8 mmol/L in aqueous phase). A high mutarotation rate represents rapid xylose conversion, but a high furfural selectivity prefers in acidic solutions, which would be perfect if organic solvents were available to form biphasic systems.}

The random forest model identified Ralstonia and soil moisture content as the driving factors of L-isoleucine biosynthesis II, and revealed that Brevundimonas and Hydrogenophaga exerted antagonistic effects on the 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis I (AIR) pathway individually while synergistically enhancing its activity. Microbial network analysis showed that the direct impact zone microorganisms constructed a highly robust degradation network by strengthening core pathways such as fatty acid metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and its functional diversity significantly enhanced network stability and the environmental buffering capacity.

abstract = {Connected Vehicles (CVs) are a crucial element in the evolution of smart transportation systems, utilizing communication and sensing technologies to interact with each other and with infrastructure. As these vehicles become more interconnected, the risk of their components being affected by anomalies or intentional malicious attacks grows. It is essential, therefore, to identify and filter out any anomalous data to ensure reliable decision-making. Existing solutions for anomaly detection in CVs include methods such as kalman filter, cumulative summation, convolutional neural networks and other machine learning models. However, a prevalent issue is the limited universality of anomaly datasets along with the variability introduced by simulated data. Additionally, there are few methods for recovering the network from anomalies using sensor information. In this paper, we address these limitations by utilizing the Tampa CV (TCV) dataset and incorporating anomalies such as bias, noise, and spikes. Furthermore, we present a novel method for real-time anomaly detection in CVs using Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BOCPD). We propose a unique recovery mechanism that employs Bayesian forecasting to interpret identified anomalies, marking the first of its kind in this field. This approach significantly enhances the security of CV systems by seamlessly merging instant detection with swift recovery, ensuring continuous protection against data integrity threats. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an average accuracy improvement of 53.83 % over other machine learning models. This paper makes advancement through real-time anomaly detection and recovery mechanisms, thus significantly improving the resilience of smart transportation systems against data integrity threats.}

Among these, the NLRP3 inflammasome has emerged as a crucial mediator linking hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation to vascular dysfunction. Dyslipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production further exacerbate plaque formation and cardiovascular complications. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) highlight the cardioprotective benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), while novel anti-inflammatory strategies, including IL-1β inhibition and NLRP3-targeting agents, offer promising therapeutic avenues. This review explores the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic atherosclerosis, with a unique emphasis on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in disease progression and how targeted interventions including SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and emerging NLRP3-modulating agents can be integrated with precision medicine strategies. Unlike existing reviews, we highlight how genomic, epigenetic, and phenotypic stratification can guide combination therapies to optimize cardiovascular protection. Integrating individualized anti-inflammatory and metabolic interventions may provide tailored cardiovascular care, reducing morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Future research should focus on refining these personalized approaches to mitigate diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications.}

abstract = {Background
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generate human-like text. One potential application of this capability is using LLMs to simulate clients in a mental health context. This research presents the development and evaluation of Client101, a web conversational platform featuring LLM-driven chatbots designed to simulate mental health clients.
Objective
We aim to develop and test a web-based conversational psychotherapy training tool designed to closely resemble clients with mental health issues.
Methods
We used GPT-4 and prompt engineering techniques to develop chatbots that simulate realistic client conversations. Two chatbots were created based on clinical vignette cases: one representing a person with depression and the other, a person with generalized anxiety disorder. A total of 16 mental health professionals were instructed to conduct single sessions with the chatbots using a cognitive behavioral therapy framework; a total of 15 sessions with the anxiety chatbot and 14 with the depression chatbot were completed. After each session, participants completed a 19-question survey assessing the chatbot’s ability to simulate the mental health condition and its potential as a training tool. Additionally, we used the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) tool to analyze the psycholinguistic features of the chatbot conversations related to anxiety and depression. These features were compared to those in a set of webchat psychotherapy sessions with human clients—42 sessions related to anxiety and 47 related to depression—using an independent samples t test.
Results
Participants’ survey responses were predominantly positive regarding the chatbots’ realism and portrayal of mental health conditions. For instance, 93% (14/15) considered that the chatbot provided a coherent and convincing narrative typical of someone with an anxiety condition. The statistical analysis of LIWC psycholinguistic features revealed significant differences between chatbot and human therapy transcripts for 3 of 8 anxiety-related features: negations (t56=4.03, P=.001), family (t56=–8.62, P=.001), and negative emotions (t56=–3.91, P=.002). The remaining 5 features—sadness, personal pronouns, present focus, social, and anger—did not show significant differences. For depression-related features, 4 of 9 showed significant differences: negative emotions (t60=–3.84, P=.003), feeling (t60=–6.40, P<.001), health (t60=–4.13, P=.001), and illness (t60=–5.52, P<.001). The other 5 features—sadness, anxiety, mental, first-person pronouns, and discrepancy—did not show statistically significant differences.
Conclusions
This research underscores both the strengths and limitations of using GPT-4-powered chatbots as tools for psychotherapy training. Participant feedback suggests that the chatbots effectively portray mental health conditions and are generally perceived as valuable training aids. However, differences in specific psycholinguistic features suggest targeted areas for enhancement, helping refine Client101’s effectiveness as a tool for training mental health professionals.}

This paper examines the impact of future climate changes on an urban watershed in southern California using an integrated hydrologic model. GSFLOW modeling software is used to simulate the nonlinear relationships between climate trends and precipitation partitioning into ET, runoff, and subsurface storage. Four global circulation models (GCMs), each with two greenhouse-gas scenarios, RCP45 and RCP85 are used to project future climate conditions. GCMs include the CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 models. The model's simulated hydrologic conditions are compared with historical data to assess changes in water budgets and groundwater supply. Results indicate decreased groundwater storage in most scenarios due to increased natural evapotranspiration, vegetation consumptive use, and streamflow out of the watershed. Only scenarios with substantially increased future precipitation show increased groundwater storage. The study also highlights increased future aridity despite the rise in precipitation and large precipitation events forecast by GCMs, which increase the risk of urban floods and decrease stream leakage and water available to vegetation.}

Based on a primary survey of Indian MBA admission decision-makers, this study identifies nine key competencies, and their relative importance, that the MBA admission process in India assesses. A key finding of this study is that industry experts and academics disagree on the importance of six of these nine competencies, thus confirming a lack of alignment. MBA admission decision-makers also do not use specific and quantitative criteria while assessing most of these key competencies. For instance, 90% of respondents said they did not use specific and quantitative criteria for evaluating execution & digital competencies. Business schools should align admissions to assess required contemporary competencies effectively.

Diabetes mellitus is a significant modulator of postoperative outcomes and is an important risk factor in the patient selection process. We aimed to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus and use of insulin on outcomes after colorectal resection using a national cohort.
Methods
Adults with a recorded colorectal resection in England between 2010 and 2020 were identified from Hospital Episode Statistics data linked to the Clinical Practice Research Database. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS) and readmission within 90 days.
Results
Of the 106 139 (52 875, 49.8% male) patients included, diabetes mellitus was prevalent in 10 931 (10.3%), 2145 (19.6%) of whom had a record of use of insulin. Unadjusted 90-day mortality risk was 5.7%, with an increased adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for people with diabetes mellitus (aHR 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19–1.37, P<0.001). This risk was higher in both people with diabetes using insulin (aHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.31–1.74, P<0.001) and not using insulin (aHR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13–1.33, P<0.001), compared with those without diabetes. Ninety-day readmission occurred in 20 542 (19.4%) patients and this was more likely in those with diabetes mellitus (aHR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18–1.29, P<0.001). Median (inter-quartile range) LOS was 8 (5–15) days and was higher in people with diabetes mellitus (adjusted time ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.08–1.11, P<0.001).
Conclusions
People with diabetes mellitus undergoing colorectal resection are at a higher risk of 90-day mortality, prolonged LOS, and 90-day readmission, with use of insulin associated with additional risk.}

Medical interviewing is a critical skill in clinical practice, yet opportunities for practical training are limited in Japanese medical schools, necessitating urgent measures. Given advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, its application in the medical field is expanding. However, reports on its application in medical interviews in medical education are scarce.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate whether medical students’ interview skills could be improved by engaging with AI-simulated patients using large language models, including the provision of feedback.
Methods
This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted with fourth-year medical students in Japan. A simulation program using large language models was provided to 35 students in the intervention group in 2023, while 110 students from 2022 who did not participate in the intervention were selected as the control group. The primary outcome was the score on the Pre-Clinical Clerkship Objective Structured Clinical Examination (pre-CC OSCE), a national standardized clinical skills examination, in medical interviewing. Secondary outcomes included surveys such as the Simulation-Based Training Quality Assurance Tool (SBT-QA10), administered at the start and end of the study.
Results
The AI intervention group showed significantly higher scores on medical interviews than the control group (AI group vs control group: mean 28.1, SD 1.6 vs 27.1, SD 2.2; P=.01). There was a trend of inverse correlation between the SBT-QA10 and pre-CC OSCE scores (regression coefficient –2.0 to –2.1). No significant safety concerns were observed.
Conclusions
Education through medical interviews using AI-simulated patients has demonstrated safety and a certain level of educational effectiveness. However, at present, the educational effects of this platform on nonverbal communication skills are limited, suggesting that it should be used as a supplementary tool to traditional simulation education.}

This work proposes a mental health counselling LLM-based conversational agent that relies on the integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reinforcement learning. RAG provides the proposed LLM-based conversational agent with contextually relevant and accurate responses through useful information extracted from a curated dataset of psychological questions and answers pooled from mental health forums. Reinforcement Learning Integrated reward Model trained with Human feedback has also been used in the proposed framework to ensure contractually of the responses generated with moral and human values. By setting up a reward mechanism that considers variables like user feedback and empathetic scores of responses, the proposed Conversational Agent learns to prioritize empathetic answers and the ones that are user preferable. With the utilization of reward-based training, the agent was able to show substantial improvements in response quality. Improved emotional alignment, steady training dynamics, decreased hallucination rates with responses having less distress and increased empathy values were the significant outcomes. The proposed methodology ensures that the conversational agent remains attentive to the emotional requirements of people seeking for mental health care and provide improved relevance and accuracy in its responses.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and clinical outcomes of tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER) in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).
Methods
This subanalysis of the Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair in Spain (TRI-SPA) registry included patients with at least severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) who were treated with T-TEER between June 2020 and May 2023 in Spain. Patients with CIEDs and no or mild tricuspid lead-leaflet interaction were compared with those without CIEDs. The primary composite endpoint was all-cause mortality, heart failure-related hospitalization, and tricuspid valve reintervention at 12 months.
Results
Among 310 patients (mean age 75.5±9.1 years, 70% female) with significant TR treated with T-TEER, 35 (11%) had CIEDs. Device implantation success was high in both groups (97.1% in the CIED group vs 96.4% in the non-CIED group, P=.81), with a similar rate of ≤2+ residual TR (84.9% in the CIED group vs 91.0% in the non-CIED group, P=.26). Patients with CIEDs experienced comparable rates of the primary composite endpoint to the non-CIED group (23.8% vs 19.1%, respectively, HR, 1.40; 95%CI, 0.60-3.31; P=.44), sustained successful TR reduction (≤ 2+ in 55.0% vs 73.8%, P=.07), and functional improvement (NYHA class I/II 81.8% vs 79.9%, P=.79).
Conclusions
In a real-world setting, T-TEER seems to be an effective therapeutic option for selected patients with more than moderate TR and CIEDs with no or mild lead-leaflet interaction, offering comparable cardiovascular outcomes and clinical improvement to those without leads. However, the presence of CIEDs may represent an independent risk factor for TR recurrence.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Este estudio tiene como objetivo evaluar la efectividad y los resultados clínicos de la reparación percutánea de borde a borde de la válvula tricúspide (T-TEER) en pacientes con dispositivos cardiacos implantables (DCI).
Métodos
Este subanálisis del registro de reparación percutánea tricuspídea en España (TRI-SPA) incluye pacientes con insuficiencia tricuspídea (IT) al menos grave tratados con T-TEER entre junio de 2020 y mayo de 2023 en España. Se compararon los pacientes con DCI sin o con interacción leve entre el cable y la valva tricuspídea con aquellos sin DCI. El objetivo primario fue un compuesto de mortalidad por cualquier causa, hospitalización por insuficiencia cardiaca y reintervención sobre la válvula tricúspide a los 12 meses.
Resultados
De los 310 pacientes (edad media 75,5±9,1 años, 70% mujeres) con IT significativa tratados con T-TEER, 35 (11%) tenían DCI. La tasa de éxito del implante fue alta en ambos grupos (el 97,1% en el grupo con DCI frente al 96,4% en el grupo sin DCI; p=0,81), con una tasa similar de IT residual ≤2+ (el 84,9% en el grupo con DCI frente al 91,0% en el grupo sin DCI; p=0,26). Los pacientes con DCI presentaron tasas comparables del objetivo primario en comparación con el grupo sin DCI (el 23,8% frente a 19,1%, respectivamente; HR=1,40; IC95%, 0,60-3,31; p=0,44), con una reducción sostenida de la IT (≤ 2+ en 55,0% frente a 73,8%; p=0,07) y mejoría clínica (clase NYHA I/II 81,8% frente a 79,9%; p=0,79).
Conclusiones
En la práctica clínica real, la T-TEER parece ser una opción terapéutica efectiva para pacientes seleccionados con IT moderada o grave y DCI sin interacción o con interacción leve entre el cable y la válvula tricúspide, ofreciendo resultados cardiovasculares y mejoras clínicas comparables a aquellos sin dispositivos. La presencia de DCI puede representar un factor de riesgo independiente para la recurrencia de la IT.}

abstract = {Purpose
This research examines the complex relationship between usage of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) amongst student and their creativity, learning and assessment using empirical data collected from postgraduate students. In addition, the study explores the student’s intrinsic motivation for usage to understand student categories. This research seeks to provide further insights into this artificial intelligence tool in enhancing the educational ecosystem for all stakeholders concerned.
Design/methodology/approach
The target population of this research – the students of post-graduation in diverse fields of science and management. A five-point Likert scale-structured questionnaire adapted from earlier literature relevant to the research questions was adopted for data collection. The data were collected for two months, resulted in 403 usable responses. Ethical considerations of assurance of confidentiality to the participants were strictly adhered to. Structured equation modelling (SEM) was employed to explore the relationships between the constructs of the study for the assessment of latent relationships. SmartPLS 4 was used to explore these relationships.
Findings
Usage has a negative impact on a student’s creativity, but increased usage of ChatGPT encourages a student’s adoption due to its perceived usability. Pedagogical applications of ChatGPT aid students as a learning tool but require controlled usage under supervision.
Originality/value
This study is innovative in the context of postgraduate students, where very little evidence of creativity exists. Through this research, the authors illuminate how ChatGPT use affects academic performance, benefiting educators as a tool but for evaluation and assessment, policymakers and students. The findings of the study provide implications that help to create effective digital education strategies for stakeholders.}

Drawing on Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and psychological ownership theory, this study examines the role of escapism in motivating workcation intentions. Escapism, as a defensive evolutionary strategy, facilitates workcation by helping individuals avoid resource depletion and pursue psychological enrichment. The study further examines how utilitarian and hedonic motivations moderate this relationship. Through two online scenario-based surveys involving 300 and 120 participants, the findings show that escapism enhances workcation intentions by fostering psychological ownership, which is sequentially mediated by perceived control and self-expression. Additionally, utilitarian motivation strengthens the effect of escapism on psychological ownership. These findings contribute to theoretical advancements in hybrid travel behavior and offer practical insights for tourism and hospitality managers aiming to design workcation experiences that balance productivity, relaxation, and personal engagement.}

In the current scenario of restrictions in the use of antibiotics and ZnO, vaccination is more relevant to control PWD, but PRRS virus circulation may compromise the immune protection conferred by postweaning colibacillosis vaccines. We evaluated the efficacy of two postweaning colibacillosis vaccines (parenteral and oral) in a commercial herd affected by an outbreak of PWD and with PRRS circulation in postweaning. Five groups were studied during the postweaning period: one control (Group 1) and four vaccinated: two with each postweaning colibacillosis vaccine administered alone (Groups 2 and 3) or with sow vaccination against PRRS (Groups 4 and 5). We evaluated the effects on piglet weight, average daily weight gain and in the percentage of piglets with diarrhea, its duration, lethality and mortality. PRRS viremia and anti-PRRS antibodies were evaluated by qPCR and ELISA. Regarding control group, colibacillosis vaccination generally improved most of the measured parameters; but significant improvements were only observed in Groups 4 and 5 (p < 0.05). Moreover, cases of diarrhea occurred at different ages: in Groups 2 and 3 the peak of cases occurred just after ZnO was removed from the feed compared to Group 1, while in Groups 4 and 5 no peak was observed. This suggests that postweaning colibacillosis vaccination may be compromised by the PRRS circulation. In PRRS endemic herds an effective protection against PWD through vaccination may require PRRS vaccination to obtain a better performance.}

Three key issues are addressed. Firstly, the paper illustrates the service process of a road reservation system. It is essential to know how the road reservation system works and the difference between it and other reservation systems. Secondly, a spatiotemporal discretization expression method based on the system-optimal traffic assignment (SOTA) model with predictive origin-destination demand for link travel time is put forward to make the supply space could be reserved, and the demand would not be mutually interfering. Thirdly, the study proposes a reverse feasible spatiotemporal route searching algorithm based on the expected arrival time to individually assign the applicants on the road network. This route searching algorithm does not use the network topology but the spatiotemporal discretized links. The departure time preference was considered in the feasible spatiotemporal route searching algorithm. Moreover, as the real demand distribution of the whole reservation area is not difficult to obtain after a period of updates, it is possible to analyze the supply-demand matching degree of the road network. Thus, four statistical indexes are proposed to assess the state variation of the road network. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The novel reverse feasible routes searching algorithm has a system-optimal trend with inputting the demand individually and an acceptable calculating efficiency. The method proposed by this paper could ensure a reliable road reservation service with accurate demand prediction. Considering the departure time preference would not bring extra burden to the road reservation system but provide more user-friendly service. Through the analysis, the supply-demand matching degree of the road network is significantly influenced by the cohesive capacity connection of the upstream and downstream links. This indicates the network structure and road attributes optimization should be considered in enhancing the road reservation service.}

The rapid adoption of scientific foundation models and their use in AI agents is changing scientific practices and thereby impacting this epistemic fabric which hinges on trust and reliance. Foundation models are machine learning models that are trained on large bodies of data and can be applied to a multitude of tasks. Their application in science raises the question of whether scientific foundation models can be relied upon as a research tool and to what extent, or even be trusted as if they were research partners. Conceptual clarification of the notions of trust and reliance in science is pivotal in the face of foundation models. Trust and reliance form the glue for the increasingly distributed epistemic labour within contemporary technoscientific systems. We build on two concepts of trust in science, namely trust in science as shared values, and trust in science based on commitments to processes that provide objective claims. We analyse whether scientific foundation models are research tools to which the concept of reliance applies, or research partners that can be trustworthy or not. We consider these foundation models within their socio-technical contexts. Allocation of trust should be reserved for human agents and the organizations they operate in. Reliance applies to foundation models and artificial intelligence agents. This distinction is important to unambiguously allocate responsibility, which is crucial in maintaining the fabric of trust that underpins science.}

abstract = {Background
Stress is a key transdiagnostic factor in the onset and recurrence of psychiatric disorders. Virtual reality (VR) in mental health care, particularly virtual natural environments, shows promising results in promoting relaxation, as evidenced by tools such as VRelax. While initial studies have demonstrated the efficacy of VRelax, further implementation in routine mental health care requires a systematic exploration of its use by patients. Understanding these perspectives can help tailor VR tools to meet the needs of users better and enhance their effectiveness in clinical settings.
Objective
This study aims to identify patient-perceived barriers to and facilitators of using VR relaxation as a self-management relaxation tool to support its implementation in mental health care.
Methods
Four focus groups were conducted with 19 participants with a wide range of psychiatric problems, including burnout, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants were recruited via a network of people with lived experience, health care professionals, and social media. Semistructured interview guides with open-ended questions were used to investigate barriers and facilitators. People with psychiatric problems were instructed to use VRelax at home at least 3 times before the focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify barriers and facilitators.
Results
The focus group discussions generated 7 themes with various subthemes. The sense of autonomy was identified as a facilitator, indicating users’ experience of feeling in control and independent, which allowed them to manage and operate VRelax on their own. On the other hand, participants indicated that for optimal long-term use, there should be a balance between autonomy and structured guidance and integration into therapy. Perceived usefulness, ease of use, and immersive factors were identified as both barriers and facilitators. Participants had positive initial experiences with VRelax but also reported that the effects of virtual natural environments might diminish with continued use. Usefulness might vary by the phase of psychiatric problems and the individual’s momentary emotional state. Participants saw the plug-and-play design of VRelax as helpful but also indicated the importance of easy navigation within the program, including the ability to quickly find specific natural environments. Three barriers were identified: shortcomings in user guidance; perceived problems in transitioning back to reality; and physical hindrances, such as the discomfort caused by the VR glasses.
Conclusions
For optimal implementation of VR relaxation in mental health care, personalized VR experiences should be facilitated, such as offering a specific selection of virtual natural environments based on the momentary emotional state, while fostering user autonomy. Integration of VR tools into ongoing treatment is important, aligning with shared decision-making principles. In addition, reducing the steps required during the starting and the closing processes is crucial, alongside addressing challenges such as physical discomfort and inadequate instructions.}

abstract = {Background
To date, no direct comparisons have been performed to compare the effectiveness of all epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing osimertinib, lazertinib, aumolertinib, befotertinib, furmonertinib, dacomitinib, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, and chemotherapy. Pooled estimations of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity (grade ≥ 3 adverse events) were performed within the Bayesian framework.
Results
Twenty-three trials involving 11 treatments were included. All EGFR-TKIs improved PFS relative to chemotherapy, except for icotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–1.44). All EGFR-TKIs demonstrated significant ORR benefits over chemotherapy. Osimertinib seemed to prolong PFS compared with icotinib (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1–0.86), gefitinib (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21–0.74), and erlotinib (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29–1.0). In addition, osimertinib showed favorable superiority in improving OS compared with chemotherapy (HR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.43–0.82), gefitinib (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45–0.83), erlotinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48–0.89), and afatinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44–0.94). Among these regimens, afatinib showed the highest ORR (cumulative probability: 96.96%). Icotinib was associated with minimal toxicity among the EGFR-TKIs, followed by furmonertinib and osimertinib. Moreover, the toxicity spectra differed among the EGFR-TKIs. Subgroup analyses of patients with two common types of EGFR mutations indicated that furmonertinib possessed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with exon 19 deletion, and lazertinib showed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with Leu858Arg mutation. We also identified differences between EGFR-TKIs in prolonging PFS in patients with brain metastasis.
Conclusions
Osimertinib is the first choice of treatment with considerable efficacy and safety for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The treatments associated with the best PFS in patients with exon 19 deletions and Leu858Arg mutations were furmonertinib and lazertinib, respectively.}

Herein, thin-walled mortar specimens were subjected to dynamic torsional tests at varying rotational speeds using a large-scale torsional split Hopkinson tube. The dynamic shear stress–strain curves of mortar specimens were obtained at different strain rates, and the dynamic shear failure characteristics were examined. The dynamic shear strain rate effect in the specimens was found to be intermediate between the tensile and compressive strain rate effects. High-speed camera observations revealed three distinct stages of the dynamic torsional failure: initial oblique crack formation, sequential formation of multiple oblique cracks, and growth of these cracks along the specimen–tube interface, resulting in a ccumferential cross-sectional crack and specimen separation from the tube. The oblique cracks formed at an inclination of 30°–45° to the longitudinal axis, located between the directions of the maximum tensile and shear stresses. Under various strain rates, numerical simulations and experiments revealed comparable rising portions of shear stress-strain curves and specimen shear strengths. However, the curve descending sections and many oblique cracks (45° to the longitudinal axis) that were uniformly formed in the middle of the specimens differed from the experimental results due to varying friction levels and specimen inhomogeneity. This work provides important information for understanding the shear mechanisms of building materials and structures under dynamic loads.}

PSs with two different functional groups, sulfate (iota (IC), lambda (LC), and kappa (KC) carrageenan) and carboxylate (low methoxyl pectin (LMP) and sodium alginate (SA)) were investigated. The optimized conditions for coacervation and activity recovery were pH 4 with a phytase-to-polysaccharide volume ratio of 12:1. Zeta potential measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, and molecular docking confirmed that electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were the main driving forces for coacervate formation. Coacervate complexes of phytase formed with LMP, SA, or KC showed a high activity retention after immobilization, with approximately 30% yield of complex and 75% immobilization efficiency of the phytase. The lower enzyme activity retention observed for IC and LC complexes is attributed to these PSs binding to the enzyme's active site. Overall, this work contributes to the body of knowledge about intermolecular interactions between phytase and polysaccharides and can serve as a guide to formulating stable, functional ingredients for a plant-based diet.}

abstract = {Summary
Background and aims
Intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) is a safe and effective patient-tailored nutritional strategy for providing nutrient supplementation to malnourished or at risk of malnutrition patients on hemodialysis (HD), who did not adequately respond to intensive dietary counselling and oral nutritional supplementation. Although IDPN is recommended by current ESPEN and KDOQI guidelines for nutrition in HD patients, none of these documents informs how to successfully implement this therapy, being the lack of knowledge on practical aspects of IDPN one of the main limitations to its use. The aim of this narrative review was to provide a practical roadmap for guiding the nephrologists, dietitians, and renal nurses in their everyday clinical practice about the use of IDPN.
Methods
A multidisciplinary group formed by specialists from the areas of Nephrology and Nutrition agreed to address different practical aspects related to IDPN in HD patients. Based on the available evidence in the literature and on the authors' clinical experience, different topics were selected to develop a detailed plan for implementing a successful experience with IDPN, proposing a practical IDPN roadmap.
Results
This IDPN roadmap provides practical information on when an IDPN should be started; what type of nutrients should be part of an IDPN; how the IDPN should be administered; how the effectiveness and safety of the IDPN should be monitored; how to determine the effectiveness of IDPN; and the conditions that advise discontinuing the IDPN.
Conclusions
IDPN is a safe and effective nutritional therapy for HD patients, although the lack of staff training may limit its use. This review addresses different practical aspects of IDPN, helping interdisciplinary teams in their daily clinical practice to improve the nutritional care of HD patients, either malnourished or at risk of malnutrition.}

abstract = {The application of sewage sludge compost (SSC) for abandoned mine land reclamation represents a nature-based solution. As the core medium of soil nutrient cycling, the characteristics and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) are critical indicators reflecting the efficacy of mine land restoration. This study investigated long-term SSC effects on DOM transformation in mine topsoil via large-scale field experiments. SSC application improved topsoil fertility and plant growth, boosting plant-derived organic inputs that enhanced DOM molecular diversity and richness. Under SSC application, the introduction of Chloroflexi as a dominant phylum promoted microbial co-utilization of labile/recalcitrant carbon, increasing organic decomposition and biosynthesis functional gene abundance. For application rates, 30 t/ha delivered fewer nutrients than 120 t/ha, slowing humification processes, while 225 t/ha caused nitrogen overload, worsening runoff-mediated losses. For application methods, spreading application concentrated nutrients in subsurface layers, intensifying plant-microbe nitrogen competition and decoupling of microbial catabolic-anabolic metabolisms under nitrogen limitation. Consequently, SSC mixing application at 120 t/ha emerged as the optimal strategy for balancing carbon‑nitrogen allocation, enhancing organic matter accumulation and stability. Over three years, the aromaticity of M120 topsoil DOM progressively increased, achieving a dynamic equilibrium among DOM input, decomposition, and stabilization through plant-microbe synergy. Overall, this study provides theoretical foundations for applying SSC to enhance soil carbon sequestration and sustainable nutrient management in abandoned mine land reclamation.}

abstract = {Real-time error correction of flood forecasting is a key method for improving forecast accuracy. However, due to the rapid and unpredictable rise of flash flood discharge and the limited availability of analysis data on short temporal scales, developing robust forecast error correction methods remains a challenge. In this study, we employed a physically-based distributed hydrological model combined with deep learning techniques to develop a real-time error correction method for continuous flash flood forecasting based on sliding runoff-rain data. Taking a typical mountainous river in southwestern China as the study area, we established three input schemes: “sliding runoff data only” (Scheme 1), “hydrological model outputs and sliding runoff data” (Scheme 2), and “hydrological model outputs and sliding runoff-rain data” (Scheme 3). We compared the real-time correction performance of three deep learning models with different architectures—CNN, LSTM, and Transformer—under different input schemes. The results indicate that: 1) LSTM performed the best and most consistently according to the three main evaluation metrics. Although the Transformer showed performance fluctuations, it demonstrated great potential in long forecast correction times, where the correlation between feature inputs and target values is relatively weak. 2) After adding sliding cumulative maximum precipitation data, CNN performance improved significantly, especially in correcting multi-peak floods. 3) The length of the forecast correction time has a significant impact on correction performance. When the forecast correction time approximates the basin’s lag time of runoff concentration, the corrected results have reached a relatively reliable level and entered a more stable phase. This method effectively improves the accuracy of real-time flash flood multiple-hour-ahead forecasting and could provide reliable references for disaster management authorities.}

However, non-agentic LLM-based methods produce responses based on direct prompts in an one-off manner, suffering from challenges in factuality and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose DelphiAgent, an innovative agentic framework for trustworthy fact-checking that employs multiple LLMs to emulate the workflow of the Delphi method, aiming at enhancing transparency in the decision-making procedure and mitigating hallucinations when generating justifications. This is implemented through a duel-system framework that integrates the evidence mining module and the Delphi decision-making module. The evidence mining module extracts evidence from raw uncensored reports and refines evidence, ensuring the provision of instructive rationales for the subsequent module. Meanwhile, drawing inspiration from the Delphi method, the decision-making module devises multiple LLM-based agents with distinct personalities to make factuality judgments individually based on the claim and its verified evidence, and reaches a consensus through multiple rounds of feedback and synthesis. The experimental findings from two challenging datasets indicate that DelphiAgent not only surpasses current LLM-based approaches but also is on par with state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced supervised baselines without necessitating a training regime, with macF1 improvements reaching up to 6.84% on RAWFC and comparable performance on LIAR-RAW. Furthermore, the generated justifications throughout the workflow underscore the trustworthiness of our proposed framework.

Recruitment issues are the most common reason for the discontinuation of clinical trials. Nurses often play an integral role in the recruitment process, yet the advantages and challenges associated with employing nurses for recruitment and eligibility screening have not been well examined. This study explores the experiences, advantages, and challenges of entrusting family nurses with the dual responsibilities of screening, recruiting, and following up with participants in the Norwegian Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) trial.
Methods
We draw on survey data (n = 28) and qualitative interview data from structured focus group interviews (n = 29) with family nurses operating in five distinct Norwegian trial regions.
Results
The results suggest that one of the primary advantages of having family nurses conduct recruitment and screening in the NFP trial is their clinical expertise and ability to attend to underserved participants during the screening process. However, family nurses found the duality of being both nurses and researchers complex and, at times, challenging, primarily due to their strong belief in the intervention and the randomization of participants.
Discussion
The dual role of helper and researcher can often be challenging for nurses, yet their engagement can significantly impact the success of a trial. This study highlights some inherent challenges of conducting randomized-controlled trials in underserved populations and underscores the need for future research to explore facilitating factors for employing nurses in clinical trials.}

Nevertheless, finding the balance between the structure and properties of materials remains a significant challenge. In this work, cellulose-based epoxy (PHPCEP) with “soft” and “hard” cooperative structures was designed and demonstrated to endow bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) with excellent toughness, heat resistance, mechanical strength, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, and solvent resistance. When 5 wt% PHPCEP was incorporated into BADGE composites, the resulting materials exhibited the maximum flexural strength (121.9 MPa) and tensile strength (71.4 MPa), a high glass transition temperature (148.3 °C), and 10 wt% PHPCEP/BADGE demonstrated the highest impact strength (70.5 kJ/m2). These figures are 18.8 %, 16.1 %, 21.5 %, and 254.3 % higher than the corresponding values of neat BADGE. The results of dynamic mechanical properties and heat degradation of the cured specimens also suggest that PHPCEP/BADGE materials have superior stiffness and toughness than neat BADGE, which could be attributed to the strong interaction between PHPCEP and BADGE, delivering better thermal stability for the composites compared to the pristine resin. Considering the remarkable effect, this work provides an effective way of highly efficient utilization of abundant cellulose and a high-performance additive for composite materials.}

Amid growing concern over children’s access to online pornography, policy makers are looking toward new and emerging technological concepts for unexplored solutions including artificial intelligence and facial recognition.
Objective
This study sought to explore and ideate emerging technological interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective in preventing and controlling the exposure of young people to online pornographic material.
Methods
We conducted a series of qualitative co-design workshops with both adult (n=8; aged 32-53 years) and adolescent participants (n=4; aged 15-17 years) to ideate potential technological interventions that are feasible, acceptable, and effective at preventing and controlling the exposure of young people to online pornographic material. A story stem methodology was used to explore participants’ attitudes toward two unique technological prototypes.
Results
Participants expressed a generally favorable view of the proposed technological concepts but remained unconvinced of their overall utility and effectiveness in preventing the intentional viewing of pornography by young people. Age-appropriate parent-child conversations remained participants’ preferred approach to mitigating potential harms from pornographic material, with parents also expressing a desire for more educational resources to help them better navigate these discussions. User privacy and data security were a primary concern for participants, particularly surrounding the use and collection of biometric data.
Conclusions
Internationally, policy makers are taking action to use age assurance technologies to prevent children’s access to online pornography. It is important to consider the needs and opinions of parents and young people in the use and implementation of these technologies. Participants in this study were generally supportive of new and emerging technologies as useful tools in preventing the accidental exposure of young people to online pornographic material. However, participants remained less convinced of their ability to avert intentional viewing, with substantial concerns regarding technological efficacy, adaptability, and user privacy. Further, co-design and prototype refinement are needed to better understand user acceptability and comfortability of these new technological interventions, alongside additional research exploring sociocultural differences in information needs and user experiences.}

Data were collected from 300 employees across four- and five-star hotels in southern India using purposive and snowball sampling, with both online and hard-copy standardized questionnaires measuring centralization, work locus of control, and bullying perceptions (work-related, person-related, and physically intimidating). Contrary to expectations, a higher hierarchy of authority was associated with reduced work-related bullying, suggesting that centralized structures may provide clarity and stability in India's cultural context. Also, greater participation in decision-making correlated with increased physically intimidating bullying, indicating potential interpersonal tensions during collaborative processes. Internal work locus of control moderated these relationships, with employees exhibiting higher internal locus perceiving less bullying, highlighting the role of individual agency in mitigating negative workplace dynamics. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about centralized authority's role in fostering bullying, particularly in Eastern settings, and underscore the moderating effect of internal locus of control. The study contributes to workplace bullying literature by offering insights into cultural and structural influences in the Indian hospitality sector. It provides practical implications for managers to design interventions that enhance employee control and address power dynamics to reduce bullying perceptions.}

On the basis of the emotion as social information (EASI) model, this study conducts three online experiments to explore the mechanisms by which emoji use by chatbots influences the willingness to adopt recommendations within the context of tourism services. The findings from the three studies indicate that (1) compared with chatbots that do not use emojis, those that incorporate emojis significantly enhance consumers’ willingness to adopt recommendations; (2) empathy and trust serve as mediators in this relationship; and (3) relationship norm orientation and identity disclosure moderate both the main effect and the mediating effects.

Evidence for the impact of organized stroke multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) on outcomes in Africa is sparse.
Aim
To compare stroke outcomes, before and after the establishment (September 16, 2016) of a pioneer MDT at a tertiary hospital in southern Nigeria.
Methods
Using a retrospective, observational study design, the in-patient record of all stroke patients admitted between September 2014 to September 2018 was retrieved and rigorously reviewed. 155 patients seen 2 years before the MDT were compared with 169 stroke patients seen 2 years after the MDT. Stroke severity at admission and functioning at discharge were assessed using the Stroke Levity Scale (SLS) and the modified Rankin scale (mRS).
Results
Mean ages (in years) were 60 pre-MDT vs 59.57 post MDT (p = 0.754). There were more males, 51% pre-MDT vs 54.2% post MDT (p = 0.565). SLS and mRS were not significantly different; severe SLS and mRS pre-MDT, 52.9% vs post-MDT, 49.4% (p = 0.727) and pre-MDT 19.4% vs post-MDT 19.5% (p = 0.685) respectively. More post-MDT patients were discharged alive, pre-MDT,56.8% vs 79.2% post MDT (p < 0.001); had swallow tests, pre-MDT 9.23% vs post-MDT 33.5% (p < 0.001); on secondary prevention, pre-MDT 67.7% vs post-MDT 78.9% (p = 0.023); had more clinic visits, pre-MDT,0.7% vs post-MDT 38.3% (p < 0.001). MDT was independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality on multivariable regression, adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% Confidence interval CI) 0.17 (0.09–0.32).
Conclusion
Our results suggest that an organized MDT may improve acute outcomes and reduce mortality in resource constrained settings where there may be no stroke units. These findings need further prospective validation.}

abstract = {Background
Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is rare, aggressive, and mostly triple-negative (TN) subtype of BC. We aimed to investigate the potential prognostic significance of Syndecan-1 (SDC1/CD138) expression in this unique tumor.
Methods
Archived charts of 50 TNBC patients [21 MpBC and 29 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)] were retrospectively evaluated. Corresponding paraffin blocks were used for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of SDC1. Compartmental (epithelial membranous, stromal, and cytoplasmic) staining scores were expressed in quartiles (Q) and correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
Results
The median follow-up period was 54.6 months (range: 2.2–112.7). MpBC patients showed significantly worse DFS and OS than IDC (p = 0.007 and 0.004, respectively). MpBC demonstrated significantly higher Q4 stromal and membranous SDC1 compared to IDC (p = 0.016 and 0.021, respectively), whereas IDC exhibited significantly higher cytoplasmic Q4 SDC1 than MpBC (p = 0.015). Stromal Q4 SDC1 expression was found to be an independent factor associated with MpBC relative to IDC (OR: 6.7, 95% CI: 1.24–36.90; p = 0.028). Stromal Q4 SDC1 expression was also an independent prognostic parameter for worse DFS and OS compared to Q1–3 in the whole cohort (HR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.6–10.5; p = 0.003 and HR: 5.8; 95% CI: 2.2–15.3; p < 0.001, respectively). In MpBC, cytoplasmic Q1–3 SDC1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for worse OS compared with their IDC counterparts (HR: 2.837, 95% CI: 1.048–7.682; p = 0.04).
Conclusion
This study suggests, for the first time, that differential expression and localization of SDC1 may contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of TN-MpBC. Therefore, targeting SDC1 (CD138) could emerge as a novel therapeutic approach for this devastating disease.}

Despite intramuscular (IM) midazolam being recommended as a primary treatment for status epilepticus (SE), its usage in Malaysian prehospital settings remains suboptimal. This study aimed to explore the awareness, practice, and barriers among healthcare professionals regarding the use of IM midazolam as a rescue medication for prehospital SE in Malaysia and provide a consensus for its implementation.
Methods
An online cross-sectional survey and modified Delphi study was conducted among healthcare professionals across Malaysia from 22 March to 31 August 2024. A modified Delphi process was used to develop a consensus from existing literature, with two Delphi rounds assessing the relevance, clarity, and importance of each question. Consensus was achieved if 90 % or more participants agreed.
Results
Among 137 responses, 89.1 % of healthcare professionals were aware of rescue medications. However, only 62.0 % recognized the superior absorption and bioavailability of IM midazolam over rectal diazepam, and 78.1 % were aware of its efficacy in terminating seizures. Of those (69.3 %) involved in SE management, 29.5 % (n = 28) were engaged in prehospital management of SE. Only 35.7 % (n = 10) reported that prehospital personnel were permitted to use IM midazolam for SE management and all required physician endorsement. Notably, 78.9 % of participants reported that 25 % or fewer patients with SE were treated with IM midazolam. The main barriers include unfamiliarity (64.2 %) and lack of protocols (62.1 %). A strong consensus was reached on the recommendation of IM midazolam as a first-line treatment for SE management.
Conclusion
While Malaysian healthcare professionals are aware of rescue medications for prehospital seizure emergencies, they lack an understanding of IM midazolam's benefits. Key barriers include unfamiliarity and lack of protocols despite strong consensus on its first-line use.}

We included 33 k–380 k participants, depending on the variables considered. Most PRSs and E factors showed additive effects on outcomes, with effect sizes generally 3–5 times larger for E variables than PRSs. We found some interaction effects, particularly when considering recent stress, history of a long illness/disability/infirmity, and social support. Higher PRSs increased the negative effects of stress on wellbeing, but they also increased the positive effects of social support, with interaction effects particularly for the outcomes health satisfaction, loneliness, and income (p < Bonferroni corrected threshold of 1.92e-4). PRSxE terms usually added ∼0.01–0.02% variance explained to the corresponding additive model. PRSxE effects on wellbeing involve both positive and negative E factors. Despite small variance explained at the population level, preventive/therapeutic interventions that modify E factors could be beneficial at the individual level.}

abstract = {Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a method of identifying emotional states from the human voice. Automatic SER (ASER) is a research domain where Machine Learning (ML) is used to extract and analyze speech features to predict emotional states. Using ML in a sensitive area like SER requires transparency and reliability of the models. For instance, ASER is crucial to understanding the underlying decision-making in real-world applications such as mental health monitoring systems. Researchers, therefore, have focused attention on advancing the interpretability and explainability of ASER models. Interpretability maximizes human understanding of complex processes by providing meaningful insights. Explainability presents the interpretable insights in a clear and human-understandable manner. Some standard interpretability methods include feature importance, feature selection methods, and attention models. Explainability methods include SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), visualizations using embedding plots, saliency maps, etc., and feature importance analysis. The current systematic review explores the different interpretability and explainability methods for speech emotion features. The current review paper aims to identify the progress in the area, identify potential research gaps, and motivate future research.}

Adjusted flow regimes and imperviousness are contributing to increased flood risks resulting from gray infrastructure and strained subgrade drainage systems. Here a new methodology is presented for designing synthetic 3D drainage channels as blue-green infrastructure to enhance multidisciplinary decision-making for sustainable urban drainage systems planning and elements of nature-based stormwater management. LiDAR derived digital elevation models and River Builder software were used to generate four unique drainage channel scenarios with different surface geometries and vegetative cover types for flood modelling. Flood risks were assessed by fluvial simulation responses to specific channel elements and the design process may translate to real-world applications. Fluvial simulations were compared to evaluate how flood inundation patterns and flow velocities responded to morphology changes and roughness coefficients. Results suggest that incorporating geomorphic principles into open drainage channels can advance blue-green infrastructure design by reflecting more natural morphological elements and improve stakeholder engagement that is well suited for nature-based solutions. By combining high-resolution LiDAR data and process-based River Builder functions, the methodology presents a design tool for interactive investigation, adjustment, and communication of continuous 3D channel design scenarios. Although further site-specific studies are needed and additional metrics may be applied, this paper demonstrates a flexible framework to support sustainable urban drainage systems and nature-based stormwater management approaches in urbanized riverscapes.}

This study proposes panoramic sales insight (PSI), a multimodal revenue forecasting framework designed to improve the accuracy of revenue predictions for flash sales. Using historical flash sales data from the fast fashion retailer Shein, the proposed PSI framework integrates both structured and unstructured data, utilizing a text–image fusion module to fuse features from product images and text descriptions and a deep neural network to forecast revenue. The text features are extracted using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), the product image features are extracted using a vision transformer (ViT), and review keyword extraction is conducted using Fumeus. Multimodal fusion then integrates these features to deliver accurate revenue forecasting. Controlled experiments evaluate the performance of each module within the PSI framework, while ablation analysis confirms the robustness of PSI. This study provides valuable insights for managers, enabling more accurate revenue forecasting and improving the effectiveness of flash sales.}

abstract = {Background
Dementia is projected to impact 152 million people by 2050, making it one of the most pressing global health challenges. The neurodegenerative process initiates well before clinical symptoms manifest, advancing from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ultimately to dementia. Despite the growing prevalence, awareness of dementia prevention is limited, and many individuals express a desire to cease living upon diagnosis. Lifestyle interventions can mitigate cognitive decline, but there is a need for effective, scalable approaches to deliver these interventions to older adults. Digital health interventions, such as app-based just-in-time adaptive interventions, offer a promising solution, but their application in cognitively impaired older populations remains underexplored.
Objective
This formative study evaluated the plausibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive digital lifestyle intervention delivered by a rule-based conversational agent (CA) among older adults with SCD or MCI. The primary focus was on adherence to the CA-initiated conversational turns (measured objectively via interaction logs), and secondary objectives included perceptions of technology acceptance, working alliance with the CA, self-reported adherence to the suggested health-promoting activity, and feedback for future improvements (through a questionnaire and short interview).
Methods
This monocentric study investigated 15 participants (mean age 70.3, SD 5.01; 10 female and 5 male participants) with SCD (n=12) or MCI (n=3). Participants used the study app that delivered daily health-promoting activities through a CA over 2 weeks. Participants received notifications to engage in 7 health-related activities, and adherence to the activities was self-reported. Post intervention, participants rated their experience with the app and assessed their working alliance with the CA through the 6-item session alliance inventory. Data on smartphone use, demographic information, and cognitive performance (via Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were collected during a preintervention visit.
Results
Participants rated the study app positively, especially regarding ease of use and a subset of the working alliance. Adherence to the CA-initiated conversational turn was measured at an average of 81% across 14 days. In total, 27% (mean 4.07, SD 2.27) of participants indicated being vulnerable, and 100% then responded with their state of receptivity, of which 83% (mean 3.14, SD 1.61) were receptive to completing the activity, and 69% (mean 2.86, SD 1.70) self-reported adherence to the activity. There was no significant decline in adherence across the study period. Qualitative results support these findings and present two emerging themes: app enjoyment and enhancing engagement.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive interventions are feasible and generally well-accepted by older adults with SCD or MCI. However, the findings underscore the need for robust technological infrastructure and potential personal assistance to optimize adherence. Future interventions could benefit from integrating wearables to improve real-time engagement and accurately monitor adherence, ultimately supporting healthy aging and cognitive health in older populations.}

In cold regions, the frost-heave of soil can cause uneven railway subgrades, affecting the safety and efficiency of high-speed railways. This study proposes a novel PCW-iTransformer model for predicting frost heave, which integrates PCHIP data interpolation, CEEMDAN signal decomposition, and WPT denoising to extract sequential features. Compared to existing models like Autoformer, Crossformer, and DLinear, PCW-iTransformer achieves a reduction of 19.1% to 34.5% in error metrics and an improvement of 2.8% to 4.6% in the coefficient of determination. Additionally, a fused parameter model based on normalized moisture and temperature improves prediction accuracy, reducing MSE, MAE, and RMSE by up to 7.6%. The model also demonstrates robustness under data scarcity, maintaining stable performance with 40% continuous or 60% random missing data. Overall, PCW-iTransformer provides a reliable approach for predicting frost heave, offering valuable insights for the maintaining and long-term stability of high-speed railway subgrades in cold regions.}

abstract = {With the ongoing advancements in autonomous navigation technology, agricultural robots are increasingly being deployed across various sectors of agriculture. Among the critical components of this technology, dynamic obstacle avoidance in complex agricultural environments serves as the foundation for enhancing the autonomy and safety of these robots. The Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) is a widely recognized method for achieving local obstacle avoidance. It operates by sampling the robot's velocity space and then evaluating the sampled trajectories using a value function to determine the optimal velocity pair. However, a significant limitation of the traditional DWA method lies in its fixed weights for the value function, which restricts its performance to manual tuning and renders it less adaptable to intricate and dynamic obstacle environments. To address this limitation, we introduced an innovative approach by integrating the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method into the weight determination process of the DWA algorithm's value function. This integration enabled the weight coefficients to adapt dynamically in response to environmental variations, thereby enhancing the algorithm's flexibility and effectiveness. Our extensive simulation and field testing revealed that while the traditional DWA algorithm struggled to navigate complex dynamic obstacle environments, the proposed TD3-DWA algorithm achieved a success rate of over 90 % in obstacle avoidance. This outcome underscored the algorithm's adaptability and robustness, positioning it as a reliable solution for ensuring safe and efficient navigation in agricultural robotics.}

These sensors are recognized for their high sensitivity, specificity, and resistance to interference from external environmental variables. This research introduces an innovative fabrication method using silicone-based 3D printing technology to develop such sensors. The approach integrates a silicone matrix with oxygen-sensitive dyes, specifically platinum(II) meso‑tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (PtTFPP) or tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline), Ru(dpp)₃²⁺, along with reference dyes such as Rhodamine 110 or 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, which are unaffected by oxygen. These phosphorescent compounds are blended into the silicone medium by manual stirring. Using a 405 nm LED as the excitation source, it was verified that the emission spectra of the sensing and reference dyes do not overlap, allowing reliable oxygen detection via a ratiometric method. The effectiveness of the sensors is evaluated by comparing the intensity ratio IN₂/IO₂, where IN₂ and IO₂ correspond to the luminescent outputs in nitrogen and oxygen atmospheres, respectively. The sensors embedded with PtTFPP and Ru(dpp)₃²⁺ show linear Stern–Volmer behavior, with sensitivity values of about 69 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, the PtTFPP-based sensor exhibits response times of 41 s and 64 s for oxygen increase and decrease transitions, respectively, while the Ru(dpp)₃²⁺-based sensor records 45 and 68 s for the same changes. This ratiometric sensing approach enhances detection sensitivity and response consistency, minimizing variations caused by fluctuations in light source intensity or fiber optics. Combining ratiometric oxygen sensing with 3D-printed silicone structures provides a robust foundation for developing next-generation oxygen sensor technologies with improved capabilities. The silicone matrix's biocompatible nature and the sensor components' high performance are a significant step toward integrating additive manufacturing and optical sensing in developing reliable, miniaturized biomedical sensors for future healthcare technologies.}

Portugal has the 10th largest Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), with waters around mainland Portugal, the Azores, and Madeira. This research focuses on the Azores region, known for its traditional multispecific fishery around the island slopes and seamounts. The region's fisheries face data scarcity issues and complicating effective management. By combining Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records from 2016 to 2022 and Portuguese Navy (PoN) Fiscalization Reports (FISCREP) from 2015 to 2022, it was possible to use appropriate metrics to characterize the fishing effort and analyze the effectiveness of the inspections conducted in the Azores EEZ. The Total Boat-Meter (TBM) metric combines the number and length of boats to quantify the fishing effort better. The analysis shows that the fishing effort in the protected areas is very high, highlighting the pressure on the protected ecosystems. The findings aim to assist regulatory institutions and researchers in assessing fishing pressure and promoting sustainable fisheries management in the Azores to preserve marine ecosystems.}

WB-affected broiler breast fillets are characterized by abnormal tissue hardness, muscle rigidity, and irregular shape. Manual evaluation based on tactile palpation and visual examination is the current practice for WB assessment at poultry processing facilities, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and may induce contamination. Structured-illumination reflectance imaging (SIRI), which is capable of depth-resolved tissue characterization and three-dimensional sample topography, has emerged a potential means for poultry defect detection, as opposed to conventional uniform illumination-based imaging. This study presents a novel effort to assess WB in broiler meat using SIRI coupled with phase-measuring profilometry. An in-house assembled, broadband SIRI platform with phase-shifted sinusoidal illumination patterns at different spatial frequencies was used to acquire images from normal and WB-affected boneless chicken fillets. Acquired pattern images at each spatial frequency were demodulated into 1) one phase difference image that depicts sample surface geometry and 2) two intensity images [i.e., direct component (DC) and amplitude component (AC)]. Hand-crafted geometric and textural features were extracted from the phase difference and intensity images respectively, and used for differentiating between normal and WB-affected samples by regularized linear discriminant analysis models. The features from the phase difference images were more effective than the texture features from either DC or AC images, and the highest overall classification accuracy of nearly 93% was achieved by modeling an optimized set of features from the phase difference images, representing improvements of about 8%–11% over the accuracy obtained using the features from DC and AC images. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of sample surface topographic profiles, revealed by the phase difference images, for WB assessment. SIRI coupled with surface profilometry offers a useful tool for WB assessment of broiler breast meat. The dataset of this study has been made publicly available11https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14558847 to enourage the research into SIRI for poultry quality assessment.}

abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLM) has driven a significant increase of AI workload in data center power demand. Renewable-powered solutions to decarbonizing LLM workload and reducing electricity costs are faced with the combined volatility of stochastic user requests and renewable energy. The key to removing the barriers in sustainable AI development lies in the adjustable capability of LLM power profiles. Therefore, this paper focuses on exploring the potential load flexibility of LLM workload and proposes a coordinated scheduling framework, notably, without computing performance degradation. Driven by the existence of the energy-optimal core frequency for graphics processing units (GPU), the energy-performance decoupling phenomenon is discovered and proved, where collaborative scaling in GPU quantity and frequency can change power but not computing performance. Motivated by this, the framework slows down the fine-tuning cluster and utilizes idle GPU resources from the inference cluster to maintain the computing performance of fine-tuning tasks. Consequently, the power consumption of the total cluster is reduced, which provides a fresh source of load flexibility. Furthermore, the framework employs dynamic frequency scaling to more flexibly modify the power profile of the expanded fine-tuning cluster. The computing performance is particularly guaranteed through temporal coupling constraints. In a simulated study supported by real-world data, the results prove a 6.8% power-saving ability and 11.3% cost-saving gains on average.}

Therapies currently available for AD do not modify the disease course and have limited efficacy in symptom control. As such, novel and precise therapies tailored to individual patients’ neurophysiologic profiles are needed. Functional neuroimaging tools have demonstrated substantial potential to provide quantifiable insight into brain function in various neurologic disorders, particularly AD. Entropy, a novel analysis for better understanding the nonlinear nature of neurophysiological data, has demonstrated consistent accuracy in disease detection. This literature review characterizes the use of entropy-based analyses from functional neuroimaging tools, including electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), in patients with AD for disease detection, therapeutic response measurement, and providing clinical insights.}

These constraints encompass factors such as the overall building size, the number, function, and size of required spaces, and even the surrounding neighborhood's existing buildings, infrastructure, and natural environment. Particularly the requirements of interior layout design are usually coupled with each other, making the design process more complex and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel manner to consider the requirements, aiming to facilitate the generation process of building's interior layout during the early design phase. Besides, this paper aims to generate vectored output, which is more applicable to export BIM model, which also benefits the subsequent design and construct steps. This paper introduces STREAMER Early Design Configurator (EDC) and SDaC Layout Designer, both of which formats the user's requirements, semi-automatically generates interior layouts and exports IFC models of the floor plans. STREAMER EDC is used to discover the potential layouts of large-scale buildings with many rooms such as hospitals, while SDaC Layout Designer focuses on residential houses with comparatively fewer rooms. These drafts are enriched with additional data, including placement information, volume details, and space utilization. Ultimately, the floor plans are exported into three-dimensional objects and exported in the IFC format. This comprehensive step paves the way for more efficient and informed building design, promoting greater flexibility and adaptability in the early stages of the architectural process.}

Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is known as TRIM19 and is a major scaffold protein organizing the PML nuclear bodies (NBs). PML NBs are membrane-less organelles in the nucleus and play a diverse role in maintaining cellular homeostasis including antiviral response. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member virus of the family Arteriviridae, inhibits type I interferon (IFN) response during infection, and nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of the virus has been identified as a potent IFN antagonist. We report that the numbers of PML NBs per nucleus were significantly downregulated during infection of PRRSV. The overexpression of all six isoforms of PML suppressed the PRRSV replication, and conversely, the silencing of PML gene expression enhanced the PRRSV replication. The suppression of PML NBs by the nsp1 protein was common in other member viruses of the family, represented by equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus of mice, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. Our study unveils a conserved viral strategy in arteriviruses for innate immune evasion.}

Drawing from evolutionary psychology, this study aimed to investigate the adaptive mechanisms underlying happiness among adolescents, considering that adaptation involves subjective evaluation, including both first-order and second-order evaluations. Through a cross-sectional study (Study 1) and a longitudinal study (Study 2), this research examined the impact of subjective socioeconomic status on life satisfaction and the mediating roles of general and personal belief in a just world. Findings from both studies indicated that subjective socioeconomic status positively predicts life satisfaction. Moreover, it was the general belief in a just world, rather than the personal belief in a just world, that mediated this relationship. This study examined how evolutionary theory and second-order evaluation theory explain the impact of subjective socioeconomic status on life satisfaction, emphasizing the belief in a just world as a crucial adaptive belief mediating this relationship. We should emphasize the belief in a just world among adolescents with low subjective socioeconomic status, as a strategy to boost their long-term happiness. By fostering a sense of fairness and acceptance in adolescents' evaluations of their socioeconomic status, we can better promote their mental health and overall happiness.}

Certain inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α, secreted by endometriosis cells cause chronic pelvic inflammation and pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether maternal endometriosis increased the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring in Taiwanese women. The study included eligible mother–offspring pairs with maternal endometriosis (the case cohort) and mother–offspring pairs without maternal endometriosis (the comparison cohort) matched for maternal age at delivery, infant sex, and delivery date, both with offspring born during 2009–2016 and followed till 2019, from the Taiwan Maternal and Child Health Database. The incidence rates and crude hazard ratios (HRs) of development delay and cerebral palsy in the offspring delivered by mothers with endometriosis were higher than those in the offspring delivered by mothers without endometriosis (developmental delay: incidence 1.51 vs. 1.30 per 1000 person-months, crude HR = 1.16; cerebral palsy: incidence 0.04 vs. 0.03 per 1000 person-months, HR = 1.38). In model 1, the adjusted HRs of development delay and cerebral palsy in the offspring of mothers with endometriosis were 1.16 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–1.22, P < 0.0001) and 1.39 (95 % CI = 1.04–1.85, P = 0.0256). In model 2, these were 1.11 (95 % CI = 1.06–1.17) and 1.01 (95 % CI = 0.76–1.36), respectively. However, the HRs of intellectual disabilities and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders were not significantly different between the offspring of mothers with and without endometriosis. In conclusion, maternal endometriosis may increase the risks of cerebral palsy and specifically developmental delay in offspring.}

Lévi-Strauss's procedures of canonical formalization for the structural study of myth are proposed as innovative structural models in anthropology, which may radically help revise anthropological methods and goals to confront the pressing problems of the contemporary world. The morphodynamic formalization of larger unsuspected entities can be modeled, simulated, and visualized by means of these structural models built in software mechanisms, which may allow us to identify instrumental ideologies and to anticipate new social changes as a result of the mediating logical operation of a boundary condition within sociocultural systems and institutional frameworks. In particular, the boundary condition can be thought to anticipate the discursive activation of a particular cultural ideology acting as a hidden agency of instrumental politics.}

However, the technology that enhances our lives presents a dual reality—it offers opportunities for criminals while creating challenges for law enforcement. Fraud, particularly, has become a pervasive issue. In response, virtual asset service providers must take measures to tackle cryptocurrency-related fraud. Nevertheless, this becomes challenging if the perpetrator exists solely within the virtual world. In 1992, Neal Stephenson used the term ‘Metaverse’ to describe a virtual world where people interact with each other using avatars. Over time, the Metaverse has transformed into a complex concept akin to 'cyberspace'. The Metaverse is a virtual environment that uses technologies to mimic the real world. As this virtual space became intertwined with financial transactions, especially through cryptocurrencies, the Metaverse evolved into a medium for perpetrating scams. Within this context, the article addresses the challenges associated with criminal activity in the Metaverse. Considering the potential applications of AI, cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens, three main challenges can be identified: 1) decentralisation, 2) anonymity of the user, and 3) lack of regulation. This article examines the applicability of existing legislation to regulate criminal activity in the Metaverse through doctrinal research. Using a comparative approach, it analyses the challenges of addressing virtual crimes by contrasting fraud (Fraud Act 2006) with sexual assault (Sexual Offences Act 2003), highlighting the complexity of addressing crimes involving physical contact in virtual spaces compared to financial crimes.}

abstract = {Background
Radiation protective garments, commonly called lead aprons, are required to be worn by healthcare workers to reduce radiation exposure. There is growing evidence that wearing lead aprons may be associated with increased prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, which can result in ended careers or reduced capacities.
Methods
Keywords were identified using the PICO method and combined in searches using Boolean operators. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and using Ovid. Additional literature was identified using academic search engines and reference reviews. The PRISMA 2020 Statement guidelines were followed for article selection. Quality reviews were conducted on included studies using the LEGEND Evidence Evaluation System. A meta-analysis was then performed using calculated odds-ratios comparing musculoskeletal disorder prevalence in lead apron wearers against a baseline population prevalence.
Results
1,873 articles were identified in initial searches, which resulted in thirty-one included studies after screening. Included studies contained 8,280 participants with over 4,500 occurrences of musculoskeletal pain. The overall body of evidence quality was low. Four of six non-cross-sectional studies found a negative consequence of wearing lead aprons. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies resulted in a combined odds ratio of 3.83 (95 % CI: 2.67–5.48, p < 0.01), with I2 at 90 %. Studies from Asian countries indicated higher odds ratios than other regions. There were no statistical differences between the rate of individuals who felt that lead apron use caused their musculoskeletal disorder and the mean prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in lead apron wearers.
Conclusions
A significant potential of injury is associated with wearing lead aprons in healthcare settings. Ergonomic interventions, training, and strategies like those implemented by organizations that require body armor to be utilized, such as reduced wear times and reduced weight, should be considered to reduce the potential of injury.}

abstract = {Background
The Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCOA) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) have recommended standards for pregnant women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2. These include achieving specified rates for neuraxial anaesthesia and conversion from neuraxial to general anaesthesia (GA) during caesarean delivery (CD), 100% attendance at the anaesthesia antenatal clinic, re-weighing in the third trimester, and anaesthesia provision by a specialty trainee year 6 (ST6) or above.
Methods
Records of 760 women with BMI ranging from 40.0-49.99 kg/m2 (89.7%), 50.0–59.99 kg/m2 (8.9%) and ≥ 60 kg/m2 (1.4%) undergoing a CD were reviewed across nine maternity units in the north-west of England. We aimed to analyse the variations in anaesthetic technique across the BMI cohorts, assess adherence with the proposed standards and explore the documented incidence of pain during CD (PDCD).
Results
Neuraxial anaesthesia was successfully utilised in 92.6% women. Spinal anaesthesia rates declined as BMI increased from ≥40–49.99 kg/m2 (81.1%) to ≥50–59.99 kg/m2 (67.2%) to ≥60 kg/m2 (45.5%), (P =0.0001), whilst combined spinal epidural (CSE) use increased (4% vs 19.4% vs 45.5%, P <0.0001). No differences were observed in the primary GA (3.7%; P =0.12) or the neuraxial to GA conversion rates (3.8%; P =0.54) across the BMI cohorts. The neuraxial anaesthesia standards for all CD categories were met by at least 66.7% of all hospitals, whilst the neuraxial to GA conversion standards for elective CD were met by only 33.3%. PDCD was documented in 6.1% and only 24.9% of women were re-weighed in the third trimester. Anaesthetic clinic attendance was recorded in 57% whilst a ST6 or above provided anaesthesia to 87.1% of women.
Conclusion
As BMI increases, anaesthetists tend to favour a CSE technique over spinal anaesthesia. Maternity units found it challenging to comply with the specified RCOA/RCOG standards.}

abstract = {Objective
HAPpEN aims to implement and evaluate a holistic general practitioner-centered, interdisciplinary obesity management strategy in rural Germany, focusing on feasibility, health outcomes, and economic benefits.
Methods
HAPpEN is a 12-month, pragmatic single-arm, multicenter trial, informed by a formative survey, and initiated in April 2023 with 98 obese participants (body mass index, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) in Kulmbach, Germany. The program integrates nutritional counseling, physical activity, and behavior change techniques, including smartphone-based self-monitoring. Monthly consultations help set personalized goals using a multi-stage grading scale. Primary outcomes include BMI, body weight, waist circumference, heart rate, blood pressure and parameters, while secondary outcomes assess quality of life, wellbeing, health literacy, social interaction, and digital therapy support.
Results
The baseline cohort (mean age: 46.9 ± 11.8 years, 74.1 % female) exhibited high obesity rates (mean BMI: 40.1 ± 6.1 kg/m2), with 48.5 % classified as grade III obese. Common comorbidities were hypertension (51.8 %), dyslipidemia (30.5 %) and diabetes (21.8 %). Chronic joint paint, mainly in the knees and hips, affected up to 82.4 %. A familial aggregation of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases was noted, alongside behavioral challenges such as lack of physical activity (81.8 %) and unhealthy eating habits (56.8 %).
Conclusion
HAPpEN addresses obesity's multifactorial nature through general practitioner-led, community-based, and digital strategies to promote sustainable lifestyle changes in rural areas. The trial aims to inform primary care obesity management guidelines, focusing on improving health literacy, patient engagement, and long-term clinical benefits.

abstract = {Compared to urban settings, rural areas are characterised by high rates of car ownership and few alternative transport options. This can lead to transport poverty, especially among older adults without car access. Community transport, not-for-profit and primarily volunteer-run local transport schemes, helps to address this rural transport poverty in the UK. This paper focuses on the emergence and evolution of these schemes, presenting a critical analysis that traces the researchers’ discomfort that arose during a study on community transport in Oxfordshire. Unpacking this discomfort draws attention to two societal processes that have shaped the emergence and evolution of community transport: neoliberalism and automobility. Results indicate how community transport can be rolled out in response to the neoliberal roll-back of the state, in this case cuts to bus subsidies and the National Health Service (NHS). However, community transport is often itself rolled-back by the state as part of further rounds of financial cuts, prompting providers to improvise ways to continue what they understand to be an essential service. Further, community transport emerges as a car-based solution in increasingly car-dependent contexts and, as such, re-enforces and further normalizes automobility. Although community transport schemes address rural transport poverty, they do not at present tackle the source of this challenge: the interconnected processes of neoliberalism and automobility. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current role of the community sector as a sticking plaster solution to rural transport poverty, as well as its potential role in contributing to the dismantling of neoliberalism and automobility.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a potential solution, but most research on that possibility has focused on final written products rather than on the writing process. This study helps to fill that gap by modeling how key variables interact in generative AI-assisted writing processes, based on survey data from 1073 postgraduate students from 21 countries studying in the UK. We used structural equation modeling to categorize AI use into three levels, from basic to advanced: 1) for technical support, 2) for text development, and 3) for transformation. Self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies positively predicted all three types of AI use. Notably, while the most advanced use of AI (i.e., for writing transformation) significantly enhanced outcomes including critical thinking, motivation, and writing quality, whereas the most basic use (for technical support) did not predict such outcomes. This study further revealed that AI self-efficacy and writing self-efficacy were significant antecedents of self-regulation, suggesting the importance of supporting students’ self-efficacy in boosting self-regulation in AI use. This suggests that the key to writing-outcome improvement may not be to teach students different uses of AI, but to develop their self-regulation to the point that they can independently explore and apply advanced uses of this technology.}

abstract = {Medical visual question answering is crucial for effectively interpreting medical images containing clinically relevant information. This study proposes a method called MedBLIP (Medical Treatment Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) to tackle visual language generation tasks related to chest X-rays in the medical field. The method combine an image encoder with a large-scale language model, and effectively generates medical question-answering text through a strategy of freezing the image encoder based on the BLIP-2 model. Firstly, chest X-ray images are preprocessed, and an image sample generation algorithm is used to enhance the text data of doctor-patient question-answering, thereby increasing data diversity. Then, a multi-layer convolutional image feature extractor is introduced to better capture the feature representation of medical images. During the fine-tuning process of the large language generation model, a new unfreezing strategy is proposed, which is to unfreeze different proportions of the weights of the fully connected layer to adapt to the data in the medical field. The image feature extractor is responsible for extracting key features from images, providing the model with rich visual information, while the text feature extractor accurately captures the essential requirements of the user's question. Through their synergistic interaction, the model can more effectively integrate medical images and user inquiries, thereby generating more accurate and relevant output content. The experimental results show that unfreezing 31.25 % of the weights of the fully connected layer can significantly improve the performance of the model, with ROUGE-L reaching 66.12 %, and providing a more accurate and efficient answer generation solution for the medical field. The method of this study has potential applications in the field of medical language generation tasks. Although the proposed model cannot yet fully replace human radiologists, it plays an indispensable role in improving diagnostic efficiency, assisting decision-making, and supporting medical research. With continuous technological advancements, the model's performance will be further enhanced, and its application value in the medical field will become even more significant.

abstract = {Background
Approximately 200,000 implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted annually worldwide, with around 20% of recipients experiencing significant psychological distress. Despite this, there are no ICD guidelines addressing mental health as part of rehabilitation programs, which primarily focus on educating patients about their condition and prognosis. There is a need to include elements such as emotional distress, social interactions, and the future use of technologies like apps and virtual communication in ICD rehabilitation, without increasing the burden on health care professionals.
Objective
This study aimed to demonstrate how data from the Readiness for Health Technology Index (READHY), combined with sociodemographic characteristics and exploratory interviews, can be used to construct profiles of recipients of an ICD, describing their ability to manage their condition, their need for support, and their digital health literacy. This aims to enhance health care professionals’ understanding of different patient archetypes, serving as guidance in delivering personalized services tailored to the needs, resources, and capabilities of individual recipients of ICDs.
Methods
Overall, 79 recipients of an ICD participated in a survey assessing technology readiness using the READHY. The survey also collected sociodemographic data such as age, sex, and educational level. Self-reported health was measured using a Likert scale. Cluster analysis categorized participants into profiles based on their READHY scores. Correlations between READHY scores and self-reported health were examined. In addition, qualitative interviews with representatives from different readiness profiles provided deeper insights.
Results
Four technology readiness profiles were found: (1) profile 1 (low digital health literacy, insufficient on 5 dimensions), (2) profile 2 (sufficient on all dimensions), (3) profile 3 (consistently sufficient readiness on all dimensions), and (4) profile 4 (insufficient readiness on 9 dimensions). Participants in profile 4, characterized by the lowest readiness levels, were significantly younger (P=.03) and had lower self-reported health (P<.001) than those in profile 3. A correlation analysis revealed that higher READHY scores were associated with better self-reported health across all dimensions. Qualitative interviews highlighted differences in self-management approaches and the experience of support between profiles, emphasizing the essential role of social support toward the rehabilitation journeys of recipients of an ICD. Two patient vignettes were created based on the characteristics from the highest and lowest profiles.
Conclusions
Using the READHY instrument to create patient profiles demonstrates how it can be used to make health care professionals aware of specific needs within the group of recipients of an ICD.}

abstract = {Generative AI applications like ChatGPT from OpenAI help users reach new levels of productivity. ChatGPT has gained countless new users signing up and sharing use cases online since its release. The paid version, GPT 4.0, was also recognized by some subscribers. However, there is a dearth of theoretical understanding regarding the generative AI subscription intentions of users. This study endeavors to explore the influence of ChatGPT users' perceived usefulness on both satisfaction and their intention to pay for a subscription, as well as the moderated mediating effect of artificial intelligence anxiety on the process of user decision-making. To achieve this goal, 274 samples were collected and validated for reliability analysis, validity analysis, regression analysis, and moderated mediation analysis by AMOS 28 and SPSS 27. The findings of this research demonstrate that perceived usefulness influences user satisfaction positively and further affects subscription payment intention. Furthermore, user satisfaction serves as a partial mediator in the connection between perceived usefulness and subscription payment intention. By employing moderated mediation analysis, this paper discovers that AI anxiety amplifies the aforementioned associations, which is counterintuitive yet intriguing. Overall, this study adds to the knowledge of generative AI users’ subscription payment intention and provides valuable insights for designing and popularizing generative AI tools.}
