abstract = {In the 21st century, health care has been going through a paradigm shift called digital health. Due to major advances and breakthroughs in information technologies, most recently artificial intelligence, the patriarchy of the doctor-patient relationship has started evolving toward an equal-level partnership with initial signs of patient autonomy. Being an underused resource for centuries, patients have started to contribute to their care with information, data, insights, preferences, and knowledge. It is important to recognize that at its core, digital health represents a cultural transformation, where patient empowerment has likely played the most significant role in driving these changes. This viewpoint paper traces the remarkable journey of patient empowerment from its nascent stages to its current prominence in shaping health care’s future. Spanning over two and a half decades, we explore pivotal moments and technological advancements that have revolutionized the patient’s role in health care. We dive into a few historical milestones, mainly in the United States, that have challenged and redefined societal norms around agency, drawing parallels between patient empowerment and broader social movements, such as the women’s suffrage and civil rights movements. Through these lenses, we argue that patient empowerment is not solely a function of knowledge or technology but requires a fundamental shift in societal attitudes, policies, health care culture, and practices. As we look to the future, we posit that the continued empowerment of patients will play a pivotal role in the development of more equitable, effective, and personalized health care systems. This paper calls for an ongoing commitment to fostering environments that support patient agency, access to resources, and the realization of patient potential in navigating and contributing to their health outcomes with an emphasis on the emerging significance of patient design.}

The research explores the relationship between shareholder structure and CSR investment, and the mediating role of analyst coverage. The results indicate that ownership structure significantly influences CSR investment, with ownership concentration and checks and balances positively correlated with CSR. The research also finds that analyst coverage mediates the relationship between ownership structure and CSR investment. Specifically, state - owned enterprises (SOEs) exhibit higher CSR investments compared to non - SOEs, and the shareholding structure of SOEs has a more pronounced impact on CSR investment. The findings suggest that enhancing ownership concentration and balance can effectively improve CSR value. The research concludes that a balanced equity structure and increased analyst coverage promote CSR investment, contributing to sustainable corporate development. The results have implications for policymakers, suggesting that refining shareholding structures to emphasize concentration and balance can better align corporate strategies with social responsibilities, fostering harmonious advancement of financial, community, and ecological interests.}

abstract = {Objective
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have improved many aspects of healthcare but also introduced challenges, including increased documentation and reduced patient-provider interaction. With recent artificial intelligence (AI) developments in the EHR landscape, such as Automated Medical Reporting (AMR) technologies that aim to automate visit summarization, there is a need to understand how these innovations affect medical interactions. However, methodological inconsistencies in existing studies on EHR use and medical interactions limit study comparability. This scoping review identifies methods to study the impact of EHR use on patient-provider interaction, providing a foundation for future evaluations of AMR implementations.
Methods
A systematic search identified empirical studies (2015-present) on patient-provider interaction involving EHRs, supplemented by three prior reviews. Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction focused on research methods, concepts, indicators, and measurement tools used.
Results
The review identified diverse methods to study EHR use within medical interactions, including video/audio analysis, structured observation, surveys, and interviews. Studies focused on concepts such as patient-centered communication, attention, satisfaction, computer interaction, and room layout, using diverse standardized and self-developed instruments. Most studies treated EHR use as separate from medical interaction. A smaller group used qualitative methods, such as conversation analysis and ethnography, to explore how EHR use is embedded in medical interaction. Indicators included gaze, typing, talk time, and consultation length.
Conclusion
Two dominant approaches emerged: one treating EHR use as separate from medical interaction, and another, less common, viewing both as functionally integrated. While various concepts and instruments were identified, many studies relied on unvalidated, non-experimental methods, limiting comparability and causal inference. A key gap remains in standardized methods that link broad communication concepts with specific functional behaviors. As AI-driven tools like AMR emerge, future research needs to adopt more integrative approaches to assess their impact and support human-centered EHR design.}

abstract = {In recent years, considerable advancements have been made in developing in vitro models to better understand the complex dynamics of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and its critical role in neurological health and disease. Incorporating astrocytes into these models introduces an essential layer of complexity, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of the cellular interactions and regulatory mechanisms that maintain BBB integrity and functionality. Despite these advances, the specific influence of astrocytes on endothelial cells in in vitro systems remains inadequately explored. This study addresses this gap by examining the transcriptional changes in primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) cocultured with human astrocytes (HAs). Our findings demonstrate that astrocytes profoundly modulate endothelial pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and division while upregulating genes associated with BBB integrity, protective mechanisms, and transporter activity. Furthermore, astrocytes significantly enhanced transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and reduced permeability to tracer Cascade Blue dye, confirming their functional impact on BBB models. By providing a comprehensive human primary cell dataset, this research underscores the pivotal role astrocytes play in shaping endothelial cell gene expression and function in contact coculture systems. These results emphasize the necessity of incorporating astrocytes into in vitro BBB models to accurately replicate neurovascular interactions. Ultimately, this study advances our understanding of BBB physiology and highlights the importance of refining in vitro models to better reflect the complexity of the human neurovascular environment, with potential implications for studying neurological disorders and drug delivery strategies.}

The present study aimed to systematically investigate the interrelationship between three-dimensional knee kinematics during walking and stair climbing and ex-vivo electromechanical measured cartilage quality in 119 patients with end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty surgery underwent radiographic assessment and biomechanical analysis in gait and stair climbing assessing in vivo knee joint angles and moments during movement dynamics prior to surgery. Electromechanical properties of the excised tibial cartilage as an indicator of cartilage quality were evaluated using Arthro-BST. Peak knee adduction angle was found to be a significant predictor of medial cartilage quality during walking (R2 = 22 %, p < 0.001) and stair climbing (R2 = 13 %, p < 0.001). During walking, knee flexion moment was found to be a strong predictor of medial (R2 = 9 %, p = 0.002) and lateral cartilage quality (R2 = 12 %, p < 0.001). Knee adduction (R2 = 19 %, p < 0.001) and abduction angles (R2 = 44 %, p < 0.01) during x-ray was significantly associated with dynamic assessments during 3D kinematics. Medial joint space width significantly predicted medial tibial cartilage quality (R2 = 16 %, p < 0.001). The results showed that biomechanical parameters such as varus malalignment during walking and stair climbing are significantly associated with tibial cartilage deterioration and contribute to a variance explanation of 13–22%.}

Initially seen as a cellular aging mechanism, it is now recognized for its roles in development, tissu repair and tumour suppression. However, the accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to chronic diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and neurodegeneration. Recent efforts have focused on “senotherapeutics”, including senolytics, which aim to eliminate senescent cells to mitigate age-related decline. Despite significant advances, senescence research faces critical challenges because of inconsistent detection methods. Common markers, such as p16INK4a and senescence-associated β-galactosidase, vary across tissues and contexts, complicating cross-study comparisons and clinical applications. A standardized multifaceted approach to senescence detection is essential, and should incorporate complementary methods, clear thresholds for senescence classification and considerations for cell type-specific variations. Such standardization would enhance reproducibility, streamline research and facilitate clinical translation, advancing therapeutic applications in aging and disease management.}

The aim of this study was to (i) evaluate follow-up services in Australia and New Zealand for children surviving paediatric intensive care; (ii) assess clinician and service-wide knowledge of post–intensive care syndrome-paediatrics; and (iii) identify barriers to long-term follow-up services post paediatric intensive care unit admission.
Methods
Two cross-sectional, web-based REDCap surveys were designed for organisational leadership and individual clinician respondents. All paediatric intensive care units with staffed paediatric beds in Australia and New Zealand were invited to participate.
Results
Eleven paediatric intensive care units and 345 clinicians responded to the two surveys. None of the 11 paediatric intensive care units reported having any dedicated outpatient follow-up services. Only 53% of clinicians had heard of the term post–intensive care syndrome-paediatrics prior to the survey. However, most clinicians believed that follow-up care should be provided to children following a paediatric intensive care unit admission (96%) via a combination of modalities (49%) (e.g., telehealth and face-to-face) conducted by a multidisciplinary team (32%). Both the individual clinicians and the organisational leadership respondents identified staffing and budget restraints as the biggest barriers to follow-up care.
Conclusions
Despite growing international evidence to support the implementation of paediatric intensive care unit follow-up services, Australian and New Zealand paediatric intensive care units do not currently offer such services. In implementing paediatric intensive care unit follow-up practices, staffing and budgetary restraints need to be addressed. Improving clinician- and organisation-wide awareness and understanding of post–intensive care syndrome-paediatrics and its impacts may also help to reduce barriers to implementing follow-up services in Australian and New Zealand paediatric intensive care units.}

abstract = {Background
Globally, the incidence of breast cancer continues to rise; however, mortality rates are declining due to the growing effectiveness of targeted therapies and treatments. Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is seen in ∼15% of breast cancers (termed HER2+). Trastuzumab is the standard HER2-targeted therapy for HER2+ breast cancers in the adjuvant setting, and is increasingly being used as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NACT or NAC). However, as well as the clinical impact, using drugs in a different treatment setting (including neoadjuvant) has a financial impact. Economic evaluation of novel chemotherapeutic strategies can assess both clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, thereby informing and guiding healthcare resource allocation decisions. Currently, the cost, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of single-agent neoadjuvant Trastuzumab remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Trastuzumab administered as neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, or a combination of both regimens (NACT/ACT).
Methods
A 3-year retrospective observational comparative analysis was conducted to examine costs and health outcomes using clinicopathological data (treatment type, surgical procedure, breast cancer subtype) from a public hospital in Ireland. Overall, 192 non-metastatic, non-palliative HER2+ breast cancer patients (Luminal B HER2, and HER2+ [non-luminal]) were selected (151 adjuvant Trastuzumab treated, 28 neoadjuvant Trastuzumab treated, 13 NACT/ACT Trastuzumab treated). The analysis estimated the cost of treatment (chemotherapy regimen, surgery type) and health outcomes, which were evaluated by analysis of survival data, and by calculating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs). Multivariate regression analysis, using survival regression model techniques, was performed to evaluate associations between treatment types and total costs- adjusted by age, stage, grade, and subtype. A Cox proportional hazard model estimated the effect of treatment alternatives for time to disease-free survival (DFS).
Results
Multivariate analysis demonstrated no significant difference in treatment cost (p=0.318), surgery cost (p=0.951), or DFS (p=0.236) between the adjuvant and neoadjuvant Trastuzumab treatment groups. A significantly increased cost of treatment was observed in older patients (p=0.011) and patients with Grade 3 tumours (p=0.037). No significant difference in cost was found between the HER2 subtype groups (p=0.129) or between disease stages (p=0.71). No significant difference in QALY was observed between adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment groups (p=0.296).
Conclusion
Overall, while adjuvant Trastuzumab remains the most cost-effective strategy for patients with HER2+ breast cancer, adopting a neoadjuvant Trastuzumab approach does not appear to pose a significant economic disadvantage. Notably, higher treatment costs were observed among older patients, a finding with important financial implications for healthcare systems. These results highlight the need for careful evaluation to inform forthcoming age-related cancer policy updates.}

The exact molecular mechanisms linking cell growth with DNA replication under different nutrient conditions remain elusive. However, recent studies in Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli have provided insights into the regulation of DNA replication initiation in response to starvation. These mechanisms include the starvation-dependent regulation of DnaA abundance as well as mechanisms involving the small signaling molecule (p)ppGpp. In this review, we discuss these mechanisms in the context of previous findings. We highlight species-dependent similarities and differences and consider the precise growth conditions, in which the different mechanisms are active.}

abstract = {This paper takes the occasion of French DJ David Guetta's use of generative AI tools to create lyrics and a voice in the style of Eminem, which he then used in one of his concerts, as the basis for an exploration of the shifting meaning of creativity and originality in the age of generative AI. Our main contention is that the Guetta form of creativity with generative AI tools differs in certain important respects from what has come before. The paper describes an iterative, dynamic process of conception, prompting, generation, refining, and deployment to characterise creativity in this context. Nevertheless, we contend that copyright – specifically the concept of originality as articulated in US federal law – is a sufficiently durable legal mechanism that can manage these new cultural forms, and that the two basic requirements of modern copyright law (a tangible medium of expression and a modest degree of creativity) remain relevant in identifying the scope of legal protection. The paper argues that the David Guetta story reveals something more general about creativity in a digital age, namely that while hybrid-networked (i.e., human – corporate – machine) creators have always created hybrid-networked cultural forms (i.e., creations that blend human and technology-constituted elements), such hybridity becomes increasingly visible and complex in the context of a new world of generative AI. At the very least, earlier – and influential – models of creativity as human-driven involving creation ex nihilo become harder to sustain in a new age of generative AI. But this does not mean copyright or notions of originality are redundant or that copyright law cannot accommodate Guetta and other cases. Such an account seems important as it challenges the hegemonic and reductive view that AI “generates” artistic works autonomously and avoids reducing the copyright issues raised by such creative works to the related but distinct question of whether learning models rely on copyrighted data. As such, copyright law should remain an important mechanism to facilitate genuine creators who are using AI systems in innovative and unique ways to push the boundaries of their creativity.}

Background
The surgical outcomes and stability of patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion determine the success of treatment. Variations in surgical interventions, patient responsiveness, and growth patterns across vertical facial morphologies result in varying treatment outcomes and postoperative stability.
Methods
This retrospective study recruited 52 adults diagnosed with skeletal Class II malocclusion treated with bimaxillary surgery; these adults were divided into two groups according to their vertical facial patterns. Cone-beam computed tomography images were collected before surgery (T0), after surgery (T1), and after orthodontic treatment (T2). Reconstructed three-dimensional images were used for cephalometric measurements and analysis.
Results
From T0 to T1, the Frankfort-mandibular plane angle decreased in the high-angle group but increased in the low–medium-angle group. The mandible advanced 9.02 and 6.21 mm in the high-angle and low–medium-angle groups, respectively. From T1 to T2, significant changes were observed in the anterior mandible horizontal movement of the high-angle group (−1.91 ± 3.63 mm) compared with the low–medium-angle group (−0.57 ± 1.04 mm). There were more patients exhibit clinically significant relapse (> 2 mm) in the high-angle group (44%) than in the low–medium-angle group (20%).
Conclusion
The relapse patterns in the two groups were similarly upward and backward. However, the high angle group exhibited greater average postoperative changes. The proportion of patients who exhibited a clinically significant relapse was higher in the high angle group.}

We retrospectively review all colorectal cases in which we used holographic 3D reconstruction from February 2020 to December 2022. This innovative approach was used to identify vascular anomalies, pinpoint tumor locations, evaluate infiltration into neighboring organs and devise surgical plans for both training and educating trainee assistants. We have also provided a state-of-the-art analysis, briefly highlighting what has been stated by the scientific literature to date. VR facilitates training and anatomical assessments, while AR enhances training and laparoscopic performance evaluations. MR, powered by HoloLens, enriches anatomic recognition, navigation, and visualization. Successful implementation was observed in 10 colorectal cancer cases, showcasing the effectiveness of MR in improving preoperative planning and its intraoperative application.

abstract = {Bortezomib is a mainstay drug for the treatment of myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, but resistance frequently develops. Overcoming bortezomib resistance is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that acevaltrate, an active ingredient from a traditional Chinese medicine, exhibits potent activity in triggering pyroptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. Mechanistically, acevaltrate induces myeloma cells pyroptosis in a Caspase-3 and GSDME-dependent manner. When Caspase-3 is inhibited by its specific inhibitor or GSDME is knocked out, myeloma cells fail to undergo pyroptosis triggered by acevaltrate. Moreover, acevaltrate promotes the production of reactive oxygen species and strikingly reduces mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistent with this finding, acevaltrate dissociates BAX from its inhibitor, Bcl-2, thereby promoting BAX translocalization to mitochondria. Furthermore, IFIT3, an IFN-inducible protein, is upregulated by acevaltrate. Interestingly, while IFIT3 fails to directly induce myeloma cells pyroptosis, it markedly enhances acevaltrate-induced pyroptosis. IFIT3 binds to Bcl-2 and prevents it from interacting with BAX. Lastly, acevaltrate effectively triggers pyroptosis in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. Pre-treatment with acevaltrate significantly restores the sensitivity of resistant myeloma cells to bortezomib. Therefore, acevaltrate strongly induces myeloma cell pyroptosis and overcomes bortezomib resistance. Given its potent activity against myeloma and its established safety profile, acevaltrate warrants further evaluation in clinical settings for its potential to overcome myeloma resistance to bortezomib.}

Introduction
We previously reported that Qingwei Zhitong pellets (QZP)-containing quadruple therapy was safe and effective for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. However, it remains unclear whether adjunctive QZP to bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT) enhances H. pylori eradication rates and reduces adverse events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adding QZP to BQT on the eradication rate of H. pylori.
Methods
In this single-center, randomized controlled trial, 336 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 14-day therapy with either BQT (compound bismuth aluminate 1.3 g three times daily, rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1 g twice daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily), BQT plus QZP (3.2 g three times daily), or triple therapy (rabeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin at aforementioned doses) plus QZP (3.2 g three times daily). The primary endpoint was the eradication rate of H. pylori. Secondary endpoints included symptom improvement, adverse effects, and treatment compliance.
Results
In intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates were significantly higher with BQT-QZP (85.7%) than with TT-QZP (73.2%) or BQT (74.1%) (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.96 and RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.96, respectively). BQT-QZP showed superior symptom outcomes, with higher rates of complete resolution (13.4% vs. 6.3% and 4.5%) and overall improvement (86.6% vs. 63.4% and 53.6%). BQT-QZP also resulted in the highest total effective rate (71.4% vs. 54.5% and 60.7%) and healing rate (19.6%). The three groups demonstrated comparable rates of overall adverse events, and treatment compliance rates were high, with comparable levels between the groups.
Conclusions
A 14-day BQT combined with QZP quintuple therapy achieves an acceptable eradication rate as first-line anti-H. pylori therapy.

abstract = {Background
Colleges and schools of pharmacy have implemented co-curricular programs that complement didactic and experiential learning within Doctor of Pharmacy programs. These programs are varied but all are directed at achieving educational outcomes, which may change based on accreditation standards.
Objective
The objective of this project was to describe student and faculty perceptions of the co-curricular program in one doctor of pharmacy program.
Methods
Two surveys were developed to assess the co-curricular program, one for faculty and one for students. Both surveys consisted of quantitative and qualitative elements, and both were comprised of three sections: overall program satisfaction, activities and reflections, and program logistics. Surveys were distributed via email to all Doctor of Pharmacy students and faculty and remained open for two weeks.
Results
Response rate for the faculty and student surveys was 59.3 % (19 of 32) and 48.2 % (131 of 272), respectively. Overall satisfaction with the co-curricular program was rated as a median of 7 (interquartile range [IQR], 6–8) for faculty and a median of 6 (IQR, 5–8) for students on a 10-point scale with 10 being the most highly satisfied and one being not satisfied at all. Qualitative results revealed that faculty and students supported the program and its intent but find room for improvements. Suggested improvements included: ensuring consistent offerings of co-curricular activities in both quantity and quality, decreasing the number of required reflections, and encouraging timeliness and quality in student submissions and in faculty reviews.
Conclusion
Faculty and students expressed general support for the co-curricular program and offered several ways to enhance the program. These insights will be important to improve the program in this college of pharmacy and beyond, especially with new accreditation standards and educational outcomes.}

abstract = {Background and Aims
Posterior pelvic ring disruption has been associated with high-energy trauma, and significant morbidity and mortality. We aimed to determine functional and radiological outcomes following sacroiliac screw fixation of posterior pelvic ring injuries at a major trauma centre.
Methods
Patients who underwent sacroiliac screw fixation at our institution, between 1st January 2013 – 1st April 2020 were identified from a database. Electronic systems were accessed to obtain information regarding patient demographics, injuries sustained, and interventions performed. Patients were contacted via telephone regarding clinical outcomes (EQ5D3L, EQVAS and Majeed scores). Radiographical outcomes were assessed using the Keshishyan cross-measure method.
Results
115 patients were identified. The mean age at injury was 51.6 years (17–84 years). Most injuries resulted from falls and road traffic collisions (83.5 %). Eighty patients (69.6 %) sustained additional non-pelvic injuries and twenty-nine (25.2 %) underwent a non-pelvic procedure, most commonly limb or clavicle fracture fixation (N = 19). Thirty-day and 12-month all-cause mortality rates were 0.9 % and 1.7 %, respectively. Clinical outcomes were obtained for 82/105 possible patients (78.1 %). Regarding EQ5D3L, 36/82 patients (43.9 %) reported a full health status; only six patients reported severe problems. The mean Majeed score was 70.3. 49/59 patients (86.0 %) returned to their pre-injury employment. A significant association was found between the clinical outcomes (EQ5D3L index, EQVAS, Majeed score) and the pre-operative asymmetry value and deformity index but not the post-operative asymmetry value and deformity index. One patient (0.9 %) required revision for infection, 12 patients (10.4 %) reported post-operative lower limb paraesthesia, and one patient (0.9 %) experienced a post-operative deep vein thrombus.
Conclusions
Most patients with pelvic ring injuries experienced high-energy trauma, often resulting in multiple injuries and operative interventions. Nevertheless, mortality rates were low, and most patients experienced either mild or no functional difficulties. The magnitude of the pelvic deformity pre-operatively correlates with post-operative clinical scores.}

abstract = {Objective
This review seeks to deepen our understanding of the factors contributing to nursing students' academic dishonesty and the repercussions of such behaviours on their learning in both classroom and clinical settings, and on the integrity of the nursing profession.
Design and methods
It was a scoping review in which a five-stage methodological framework informed its process. Six databases were searched for relevant original studies. Other search methods were also conducted using Google Scholar, Trove, and ProQuest Dissertations for theses pertinent to the topic. An inductive descriptive approach was used to analyse and synthesise data.
Results
Twenty-seven studies and nine doctoral theses were selected and included in the scoping review. Of these, 25 studies used a quantitative approach, nine studies a qualitative one, and two studies used mixed methods. Three categorical factors, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and external, contributed to nursing students' academic dishonesty.
Conclusion
Academic dishonesty in nursing students is concerning. Noted factors contributing to academic dishonesty include stress and pressure experienced by students, the prevalence of peer cheating, and lack of knowledge. Most alarming is the significant correlation between academic dishonesty and clinical dishonesty. The evidence suggests that students who engage in dishonest behaviour in academic settings may be more likely to engage in dishonest behaviour in clinical settings. This raises serious concerns about integrity, ethics, patient safety and the reputation of nursing students, universities, healthcare providers and health professionals.}

abstract = {Forest water reclamation is a decades-old practice of repurposing municipal reclaimed water using land application on forests to filter nutrients and increase wood production. However, long-term application may lead to nutrient saturation, leaching, and potential impairment of ground and surface water quality. We studied long-term effects of reclaimed water application on nutrient leaching potential in a four-decade time series of forest water reclamation facilities in northern Idaho. Our approach compared reclaimed water treated plots with untreated control plots at each of the forest water reclamation facilities. We measured soil nitrifier abundance and net nitrification rates and used tension lysimeters to sample soil matrix water and drain gauges to sample from a combination of matrix and preferential flow paths. We determined nutrient leaching as the product of soil water nutrient concentrations and model-estimated drainage flux. There was more than 450-fold increase in nitrifier abundance and a 1000-fold increase in net nitrification rates in treated plots compared with control plots at long-established facilities, indicating greater nitrate production with increased cumulative inputs. There were no differences in soil water ammonium, phosphate, and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations between control and effluent treatments in tension lysimeter samples. However, concurrent with increased nitrifier abundance and net nitrification, nitrate concentration below the rooting zone was 2 to 4-fold higher and nitrate leaching was 4 to 10-fold higher in effluent treated plots, particularly at facilities that have been in operation for over two decades. Thus, net nitrification and nitrifier abundance assays are likely indicators of nitrate leaching potential. Inorganic nutrient concentrations in drain gauge samples were 2 to 11-fold higher than lysimeter samples, suggesting nutrient losses occurred predominantly through preferential flow paths. Nitrate was vulnerable to leaching during the wet season under saturated flow conditions. Although nitrogen saturation is a concern that should be mitigated at long-established facilities, these forest water reclamation facilities were able to maintain average soil water nitrate concentrations to less than 2 mg L−1, so that nitrogen and phosphorous are effectively filtered to below safe water standards.}

Background
The purpose of the study was to evaluate both the accuracy and reproducibility of the answers given by ChatGPT-4o®, Gemini® and Copilot® to frequently asked questions about pediatric primary enuresis nocturna.
Methods
Forty frequently asked questions about primary nocturnal enuresis were asked 2 times, one week apart, on ChatGPT-4o, Gemini and Copilot. One of each pediatric surgeon and nephrologist independently scored the answers into 4 groups: comprehensive/correct (1), incomplete/partially correct (2), a mix of accurate and inaccurate/misleading (3), and completely inaccurate/irrelevant (4). The accuracy and reproducibility of each chatbots answers were evaluated.
Results
In comparison of these most common used chatbots, the order of completely correct response rates from highest to lowest was Chat GPT-4o and followed by Copilot and Gemini. With an accuracy percentage of 92.5 %, ChatGPT-4o gave the most accurate responses of any AI chatbot. Gemini answered 50 % of questions correctly. Copilot was the weakest successful chatbot in answering questions about enuresis nocturna with 45 % of completely accurate answer ratio. Besides Copilot has a ratio of 2.5 % for completely inaccurate/irrelevant response. Reproducibility of ChatGPT-4o, Gemini and Copilots were 85 %, 77.5 %, 70 % respectively.
Conclusion
ChatGPT-4o is more successful in providing a high percentage of accurate responses regarding nocturnal enuresis. Both patients and their parents can use it, especially for simple, low-complexity medical questions. However, it should be used alongside expert healthcare proffesional.}

This study proposes an enhanced deep learning framework, SE-ResNet50, which integrates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block into the conventional ResNet50 architecture to improve the classification of diabetic kidney pathology from glomerular images. The SE block adaptively recalibrates feature responses, enabling the model to emphasize diagnostically relevant structures better. The proposed framework was trained and validated on a kidney tissue dataset from Kanazawa Medical University, achieving superior performance with an accuracy of 97.02 ​%, precision of 0.96, and an AUC of 0.9856. SE-ResNet50 exhibited superior robustness and generalizability compared to established CNN architectures such as EfficientNet B0, Inception V3, and ConvNeXt. Further visualization via Grad-CAM revealed that the model effectively localizes critical regions within glomerular images. These results highlight the potential of SE-ResNet50 as a reliable and interpretable tool for advancing diabetes-related CKD diagnosis in clinical settings.}

To evaluate the effectiveness of GPT-4 in generating valid multiple-choice exam items for assessing therapeutic knowledge in pharmacy education.
Methods
A custom GPT application was developed to create 60 case-based items from a pharmacotherapy textbook. Nine subject matter experts reviewed items for content validity, difficulty, and quality. Valid items were compiled into a 38-question exam administered to 46 fourth-year pharmacy students. Classical test theory and Rasch analysis were used to assess psychometric properties.
Results
Of 60 generated items, 38 met content validity requirements, with only 6 accepted without revisions. The exam demonstrated moderate reliability and correlated well with a prior cumulative therapeutics exam. Classical item analysis revealed that most items had acceptable point biserial correlations, though fewer than half fell within the recommended difficulty range. Rasch analysis indicated potential multidimensionality and suboptimal targeting of item difficulty to student ability.
Conclusion
GPT-4 offers a preliminary step toward generating exam content in pharmacy education but has clear limitations that require further investigation and validation. Substantial human oversight and psychometric evaluation are necessary to ensure clinical realism and appropriate difficulty. Future research with larger samples is needed to further validate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in item generation for high-stakes assessments in pharmacy education.}

The main goal underpinning such protocols is to protect the Internet connections between IoE machines from malicious activities such as unauthorized eavesdropping, monitoring, and tampering with messages. In theory, these protocols are supposed to be secure. Still, most existing implementations partially follow the standard features of (D)TLS 1.2/3, leaving them vulnerable to risks such as side-channel and network attacks. In this paper, we critically review the standard protocols deployed for the security management of data and connected machines, and also examine the recently discovered vulnerabilities that lead to successful zero-day attacks in IoE environments. Then, we discuss various potential countermeasures in the form of organizational policy enforcement strategies and mitigation approaches that can be used by cybersecurity practitioners, decision- and policy-makers. Finally, we identify both proactive and reactive solutions for further consideration and study, as well as propose alternative mechanisms and e-governance policies for standardizing organizations and engineers in future solution designs.}

abstract = {Background
Asthma (AS) and allergic rhinitis (AR), though sharing Th2-driven inflammation, exhibit distinct clinical trajectories, with molecular mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remaining poorly characterized. This study aimed to delineate conserved and divergent immunometabolic pathways and develop a blood-based diagnostic framework integrating multi-omics biomarkers.
Methods
We harmonized 8 peripheral blood transcriptomic cohorts (n = 1,073) using ComBat correction, performed Mendelian randomization (MR) across 5 asthma cohorts (FinnGen Release 12), and constructed a combinatorial machine learning model (113 configurations) validated in 5 independent cohorts.
Results
Bidirectional regulation of the Y-chromosomal gene RPS4Y1 (upregulated in AR, downregulated in AS) was linked to disease-specific immunometabolic reprogramming (P < 0.001). MR identified 7 causal plasma proteins (GRAMD1C, GSTO1, IL1RAP, MMP9, PDXK, SAT2, SIGLEC12) intersecting transcriptomic signatures, implicating oxidative stress as a shared mechanism. The glmBoost-RF diagnostic model integrating these biomarkers achieved superior accuracy (AUC >95% in 4/5 cohorts), outperforming conventional classifiers reliant on IgE or eosinophils. Immune profiling revealed AR-specific native B-cell expansion and Treg depletion versus AS-associated CD4+ T/NK cell activation (P < 0.05). Coordinated dysregulation of Y-chromosomal genes (EIF1AY, KDM5D) suggested sex-dimorphic immune modulation.
Conclusions
This integrative analysis establishes RPS4Y1 as a central regulator of allergic inflammation dimorphism and delivers a validated multi-omics classifier for precision diagnostics. The findings bridge molecular sex differences, metabolic-immune crosstalk, and clinical heterogeneity, advancing phenotype-specific therapeutic strategies.}

Moreover, the accuracy of extracting glacier boundaries from a single remote sensing image (RSIs) is often influenced by seasonal snow, clouds, shadows, and frozen lakes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model for extracting the non-debris-covered areas of glaciers (NDCAG) from RSIs, termed GlacierSTR-UNet. This model enhances information flow and overall performance by embedding the Swin Transformer (ST) as an encoder into a U-shaped architecture and reduces training time and improves gradient handling by incorporating the ResNet block in the decoder. We deploy the GlacierSTR-UNet model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to efficiently generate multiple NDCAG results from RSIs taken at different periods. A pixel-by-pixel synthesis algorithm is then applied to aggregate the multiple NDCAG extraction results, producing the final NDCAG. Accuracy assessments indicate that GlacierSTR-UNet achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8817, and the relative deviation between automatically extracted and manually interpreted NDCAG remains within 2 %. Finally, we obtain the NDCAG datasets for the periods of 2015/2016 and 2022/2023 in High-Mountain Asia, revealing a reduction of 4,185.12 ± 7,870.96 km2 in NDCAG from 2015/2016 to 2022/2023. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently and accurately extracting NDCAG, highlighting its potential for monitoring glacier changes and supporting glacier inventory efforts.}

abstract = {Background
The health-related quality of life (HRQoL), economic burden, and diagnostic and treatment status of Chinese patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) remain largely unknown. This study assessed patient characteristics, HRQoL, and economic burden among Chinese patients with MF and SS through a cross-sectional survey.
Methods
Eligible patients were aged ≥18 years with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of MF or SS and were either currently receiving or had received disease-specific treatment within the past year. Patients completed a paper-based quantitative survey covering four components: patient demographics, diagnosis and treatment journey, economic burden, and HRQoL instrument.
Results
Between July 21, 2022, and October 24, 2022, 61 eligible patients participated in this study, of whom 91.8% (56/61) had MF and 8.2% (5/61) had SS. The total cost for patients with MF and SS was Chinese Yuan (CNY) 86,729 (US Dollar [USD] 12,425). The total cost for patients with early-stage disease was significantly lower than that for patients with advanced-stage disease (CNY 43,379 vs. 128,681, P < 0.001). The direct cost for MF and SS patients was CNY 72,467 (USD 10,382). The direct cost for patients with early-stage disease was significantly lower than that for patients with advanced-stage disease (CNY 29,018 vs. 114,514, P < 0.001). The direct medical cost for MF and SS patients was CNY 65,524 (USD 9387). The direct medical cost for patients with early-stage disease was significantly lower than that for patients with advanced-stage disease (CNY 23,069 vs. 106,609, P < 0.001). Regarding HRQoL, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) score of Chinese time trade-off values for 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) health states was 0.79 (0.18) for all respondents. The mean utility score for advanced-stage patients was significantly lower than that of early-stage patients (advanced-stage: 0.73 [0.18] vs. early-stage: 0.84 [0.16], P = 0.010). On the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale, the mean (SD) score for all patients with MF or SS was 61.3 (12.4). Advanced-stage patients had lower mean scores than early-stage patients, indicating poorer HRQoL (early-stage: 65.50 [13.48] vs. advanced-stage: 57.26 [9.96], P = 0.009). For the Skindex-29 instrument, the mean (SD) score was 43.4 (24.2).
Conclusions
Chinese patients with MF or SS, especially advanced-stage patients, experience high economic burden and compromised HRQoL, which underscore the need for improved access to affordable treatments and supportive care measures to reduce the financial burden and enhance the well-being of these patients. Healthcare policies and interventions should prioritize early diagnosis and effective management to improve the treatment outcome and reduce its associated costs.}

Technological advances over the past century have accelerated the pace and breadth of medical and surgical care. From the initial delivery of “telemedicine” over the radio in the 1920s, the delivery of medicine and surgery in the 21st century is no longer limited by connectivity. The COVID-19 pandemic hastened the uptake of telemedicine to ensure that health care can be maintained despite limited face-to-face contact. Like other areas of medicine, vascular surgery has adopted telemedicine, although its role is not well described in the literature. This narrative review explores how telemedicine has been delivered in vascular surgery. Specific themes of telemedicine are outlined with real-world examples, including consultation, triaging, collaboration, mentoring, monitoring and surveillance, mobile health, and education. This review also explores possible future advances in telemedicine and issues around equity of care. Finally, important ethical considerations and limitations related to the applications of telemedicine are outlined.}

abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4 (CG4) are proving to be valuable tools in the medical field, not only in facilitating administrative tasks, but in augmenting medical decision-making. LLMs have previously been tested for diagnostic accuracy with expert-generated questions and standardized test data. Among those studies, CG4 consistently outperformed alternative LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5 (now no longer publicly available for use) and Google Bard (now known as “Google Gemini”). The next logical step was to begin to explore CG4’s accuracy within a specific clinical domain. Our study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CG4 within an inpatient neurology consultation service.
Methods
We conducted a review of all patients listed on the daily neurology consultation roster at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, CA, for all days surveyed until we reached a total of 51 patients, ensuring a complete and representative sample of the patient population. ChatGPT-4, using HIPAA-compliant methodology, received patient data from the Epic EHR as input and was asked to provide an initial differential diagnoses list, investigations and recommended actions, a final diagnosis, and a treatment plan for each patient. A comprehensiveness scale (an ordinal scale between 0 and 3) was then used to rate match accuracy between consultant and CG4 initial diagnoses and the consultants’ final diagnoses. In this proof-of-concept study, we assumed that the neurology consultants’ final diagnoses were accurate. We employed a non-parametric bootstrap resampling method to create 95 % confidence intervals around mean scores, a Fisher’s Exact test, a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and ordinal logistic regression models to compare the performance between consultant and CG4 groups.
Findings
Our study found that CG4 demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of consultant neurologists. The most frequent comprehensiveness score achieved by both groups was "3," with consultant neurologists achieving this score 43 times and CG4 achieving it 31 times. The mean comprehensiveness scores were 2.75 (95 % CI: 2.49–2.90) for the consultant group and 2.57 (95 % CI: 2.31–2.67) for the CG4 group. The success rate for comprehensive diagnoses (a score of "2″ or "3″) was 94.1 % (95 % CI: 84.1%–98.0 %) for consultants and 96.1 % (95 % CI: 86.8%–98.9 %) for CG4, with no statistically significant difference in success rates (p = 1.00). The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test indicated that the consultant group had a higher likelihood of providing more comprehensive diagnoses (W = 1583, p = 0.02). Ordinal logistic regression models identified significant predictors of diagnostic accuracy, with the consultant diagnosis group showing an odds ratio of 3.68 (CI 95 %: 1.28–10.55) for higher value outcomes. Notably, integrating CG4’s initial diagnoses with those from consultants could achieve comprehensive diagnostics in all cases, indicating a number needed to treat (NNT) of 17 to attain one additional comprehensive diagnosis.
Interpretation
Our findings suggest that CG4 can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool within the domain of inpatient neurology, providing comprehensive and accurate initial diagnoses comparable to those of consultant neurologists. The use of CG4 might contribute to better patient outcomes by serving as an aid in diagnosis and treatment recommendations, potentially leading to reduced missed diagnoses and quicker diagnostic processes. Continuous strategies and evaluations to improve LLMs' accuracy remain crucial. Further studies with larger sample sizes and independent third-party evaluations are recommended to confirm these findings and assess the impact of LLMs on patient health.}

This conserved modification interacts with vital cellular pathways. Although O-GlcNAc is widely distributed throughout the body, it is particularly enriched in the brain, where most proteins are O-GlcNAcylated. Recent studies have established a causal link between O-GlcNAc regulation in the brain and alterations in neurophysiological function. Alterations in O-GlcNAc levels in the brain are associated with the pathogenesis of several neurogenic diseases that can lead to cognitive impairment. Remarkably, manipulation of O-GlcNAc levels demonstrated a protective effect on cognitive function. Although the precise molecular mechanism of O-GlcNAc modification in the nervous system remains elusive, its regulation is fundamental to multiple neural and cognitive functions, fluctuating levels during normal and pathological cognitive processes. In this review, we highlight the significant functional importance of O-GlcNAc modification in pathological cognitive impairments and the potential application of O-GlcNAc as a promising target for the intervention or amelioration of cognitive impairments.}

abstract = {Background
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is essential to provide early COVID-19 treatment for people at high risk of severe illness and to limit the spread of infection in society. Proper upper respiratory specimen collection is the most critical step in the diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in public settings, and throat swabs were the preferred specimens used for mass testing in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is still a discussion about whether throat swabs have a high enough sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, as previous studies have reported a large variability in the sensitivity from 52% to 100%. Many previous studies exploring the diagnostic accuracy of throat swabs lack a detailed description of the sampling technique, which makes it difficult to compare the different diagnostic accuracy results. Some studies perform a throat swab by only collecting specimens from the posterior oropharyngeal wall, while others also include a swab of the palatine tonsils for SARS-CoV-2 testing. However, studies suggest that the palatine tonsils could have a tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2 that may improve the SARS-CoV-2 detection during sampling. This may explain the variation of sensitivity reported, but no clinical studies have yet explored the differences in sensitivity and patient discomfort whether the palatine tonsils are included during the throat swab or not.
Objective
The objective of this study is to examine the sensitivity and patient discomfort of a throat swab including the palatine tonsils compared to only swabbing the posterior oropharyngeal wall in molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
We will conduct a randomized controlled study to compare the molecular detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by a throat swab performed from the posterior oropharyngeal wall and the palatine tonsils (intervention group) or the posterior oropharyngeal wall only (control group). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. All participants fill out a baseline questionnaire upon enrollment in the trial, examining their reason for being tested, symptoms, and previous tonsillectomy. A follow-up questionnaire will be sent to participants to explore the development of symptoms after testing.
Results
A total of 2315 participants were enrolled in this study between November 10, 2022, and December 22, 2022. The results from the follow-up questionnaire are expected to be completed at the beginning of 2024.
Conclusions
This randomized clinical trial will provide us with information about whether throat swabs including specimens from the palatine tonsils will improve the diagnostic sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection. These results can, therefore, be used to improve future testing recommendations and provide additional information about tissue tropism for SARS-CoV-2.

abstract = {In November 2022, ChatGPT marked a transformative moment in artificial intelligence, leveraging generative AI tools (GAI) and large language models (LLMs) to mimic human language effectively. Their rapidly gained popularity has reshaped a number of areas, presenting both challenges and opportunities. With their widespread adoption, concerns arise regarding the reliability of information generated by these tools, particularly in detecting fake news and addressing hallucinations. This study, conducted within the OpenFact project, involves an experiment with students tasked to generate and critically assess text produced by GAI tools. Results indicate a common occurrence of hallucinations in LLM outputs and a lack of transparency in information sources, posing challenges for practical applications. Furthermore, participants demonstrate the ease of manipulating GAI tools to generate false information, underscoring the risk associated with their widespread use. These findings contribute to understanding the limitations and implications of utilizing GAI tools in information verification processes and highlight the need for further research in this area.}

ChatGPT4 can respond to free-text queries, answer questions and make suggestions regarding virtually any topic. ChatGPT4 has successfully answered anesthesia and even obstetric anesthesia knowledge-based questions with reasonable accuracy. However, ChatGPT4 has yet to be challenged in obstetric anesthesia clinical decision-making. Study Objective: In this study, we evaluated the performance of ChatGPT4 in the management of clinical labor analgesia scenarios compared to expert obstetric anesthesiologists. Intervention: Eight clinical questions with progressively increasing medical complexity were posed to ChatGPT4. Measurements: The ChatGPT4 responses were rated by seven expert obstetric anesthesiologists based on safety, accuracy and completeness of each response using a five-point Likert rating scale. Main Results: ChatGPT4 was deemed safe in 73% of responses to the presented obstetric anesthesia clinical scenarios (27% of responses were deemed unsafe). None of the ChatGPT4 responses were unanimously deemed to be safe by all seven expert obstetric anesthesiologists. Moreover, ChatGPT4 responses were overall partly accurate (score 4 out of 5) and somewhat incomplete (score 3.5 out of 5). Conclusions: In summary, approximately one quarter of all responses by ChatGPT4 were deemed unsafe by expert obstetric anesthesiologists. These findings may suggest the need for more fine-tuning and training of LLMs such as ChatGPT4 specifically for clinical decision making in obstetric anesthesia or other specialized medical fields. These LLMs may come to play an important future role in assisting obstetric anesthesiologists in clinical decision making and enhancing overall patient care.}

To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-4o in accurately identifying features and categories from thyroid nodule ultrasound images following the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS).
Methods
This comparative validation study, conducted between October 2023 and May 2024, utilized 202 thyroid ultrasound images sourced from 3 open-access databases. Both complete and cropped versions of each image were independently evaluated by expert radiologists to establish a reference standard for TI-RADS features and categories. GPT-4 and GPT-4o were prompted to analyze each image, and their generated TI-RADS outputs were compared to the reference standard.
Results
GPT-4 demonstrated high specificity but low sensitivity when assessing complete thyroid ultrasound images across most TI-RADS categories, resulting in mixed overall accuracy. For low-risk nodules (benign), GPT-4 achieved 25.0% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity, and 93.6% accuracy. In contrast, in the higher risk moderately suspicious category GPT-4 showed 75% sensitivity, 22.2% specificity, and 42.1% accuracy. While GPT-4 effectively identified features like smooth margins (73% vs 65% the reference standard), it struggled to identify other features like isoechoic echogenicity (5% vs 46%), and echogenic foci (3% vs 27%). The assessment of cropped images using both GPT-4 and GPT-4o followed similar patterns, though with slight deviations indicating a decrease in performance compared to GPT-4's assessment of complete images.
Conclusion
While GPT-4 and GPT-4o models show potential for improving the efficiency of thyroid nodule triage, their performance remains suboptimal, particularly in higher-risk categories. Further refinement and validation of these models are necessary before clinical implementation.}

abstract = {Introduction
As medical education increasingly incorporates digital methods such as video lectures, e-learning, and virtual meetings, it becomes crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual classrooms in teaching surgical techniques. This study aims to assess whether live virtual classrooms can effectively convey surgical skills to medical students.
Methods
First- and second-y medical students were randomized to in-person or live-video sessions once a week, for 2 wk. Students were taught how to perform simple interrupted sutures with instrument-tying. At the end of the workshop, participants were recorded performing simple interrupted sutures. Postinstruction skills videos, blinded to student group placement, were graded from 1 to 5 based on instrument handling, time, efficiency, tissue handling, wound closure, and overall technique.
Results
Out of 114 enrolled students, 42 completed the workshop. Notably, the virtual group had a significantly higher proportion of dropouts than the in-person group. Rubric scores showed no significant differences in various skill categories between the two groups. While both groups acknowledged the helpfulness of their respective methods, a majority expressed a preference for in-person instruction. The postcourse survey revealed that students valued in-person instruction for real-time feedback and multiple-angle demonstrations.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that video instruction may be equally effective in improving students' surgical technique compared to live sessions. However, it also highlights a clear personal preference among students for in-person instruction, emphasizing the value of a personalized, hands-on approach and enhanced visibility provided by in-person teaching methods.}

Recent research has suggested that combining CJ with various approaches to judge recruitment, including community-driven and crowdsourcing methods, holds promise as a method of assessing L2 writing, especially for research purposes. However, the majority of studies to date have tested CJ only using relatively simple, easily evaluated sets of texts. There remains insufficient evidence of the method’s potential for assessing more complex texts, particularly when the comparisons are being conducted by crowdsourced assessors. This study seeks to address this problem by testing the reliability and validity of a crowdsourced form of CJ for the assessment of texts which are longer, more topically diverse, and more homogeneous in proficiency than those used in earlier studies. The results suggest that CJ can be conducted with crowdsourced judges to generate reliable assessments of L2 writing, and provide initial evidence of concurrent validity. However, there are drawbacks in terms of efficiency.}

ChatGPT, a large language model introduced in November 2022, offers a potential solution for this problem. To examine the potential reliability and credibility of leveraging ChatGPT for argumentation feedback, the study conducted a retrospective analysis by applying ChatGPT to generate feedback on 50 sets of argumentation contents that human teachers had previously assessed. The study first assessed the feedback accuracy of ChatGPT and the factors that influenced the evaluation of arguments. The findings showed that ChatGPT demonstrated impressive precision rate (91.8 %) and recall rate (63.2 %) when providing feedback on arguments, indicating that ChatGPT possesses a fundamental capability to provide feedback on arguments. However, this capability of ChatGPT was significantly affected by the length of arguments and the discourse markers used in the arguments. The study then qualitatively compared the ChatGPT's feedback and teacher's feedback. The results revealed that these two types of feedback each had their own advantages and disadvantages. While ChatGPT could potentially generate comprehensive feedback and textual-based feedback, and limited to the linguistic level when provide affective feedback, teacher's feedback was more focused on student's overall learning progress, based on personal teaching experience to correctly identify immediate critical problem of the student, and consideration on the humanistic empathy interaction. Although the overall findings suggested that ChatGPT exhibited potential reliability and credibility for argumentation feedback, the study did identify several limitations.}

Disagreement persists regarding the cause of death in patients with tuberculosis (TB) between the national TB registry and vital registration statistics. This study investigated the disagreement and contributing factors between TB-related and non-TB-related deaths using an integrated national TB database in South Korea.
Methods
We identified a sub-set cohort of 29,033 patients with drug-susceptible TB registered between 2011 and 2020 who died during TB treatment. The cause of death was identified by the Korean National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (KNTSS) and Statistics Korea database. We performed a multinomial logistic regression to identify factors associated with the cause of death.
Results
The participants’ median age was 79 years (interquartile range, 70–85 years), with males comprising 63.2 %. Among the 29,033 deaths, 12,937 (44.6 %) and 6028 (20.8 %) were classified as TB-related deaths in Statistics Korea and KNTSS, respectively. The overall agreement rate for the cause of death between the two databases was 0.72 (95 % confidence interval, 0.71–0.72), increasing from 0.69 in 2011–0.77 in 2020. Among discrepant cases, 92.2 % (7545/8181) were classified as non-TB-related in KNTSS but as TB-related in Statistics Korea. Over the study period, the proportion of individuals classified as non-TB-related deaths in both databases and the agreement rate increased. In the multinomial analysis, age, sputum acid-fast bacilli smear, Charlson comorbidity index, and comorbidities, such as cancer and end-stage renal disease, showed distinguishing features across the cause of death groups.
Conclusions
Substantial disagreement on the cause of death persists between the national TB registry and vital registration statistics, though this decreased during the study period. Most disagreement likely indicates an underestimation of TB-related deaths in the TB registry. Age, sputum smear, and comorbidities were identifiable characteristics across groups that may influence the cause of death coding process.}

The lipomodeling technique has transformed the management of Poland syndrome-associated thoraco-mammary deformities. Complex type 3 cases with significant thoracic deformity often require a combined approach, including the latissimus dorsi flap, which is absent in about 10 % of cases. These patients face therapeutic challenges. The breast-pectoralis flap (BPF), developed for breast reconstruction, allows transfer of tissue from the contralateral breast. This study aimed to evaluate the BPF's contribution to correcting severe thoraco-mammary deformities in Poland syndrome and associated syndromes.
Materials and methods
We conducted a case series on five female patients aged 11–16 years between 2012 and 2024 to evaluate outcomes and complications of breast reconstruction using the BPF. Four had severe stage III Poland syndrome with marked thoracic deformity. One had sequelae from cystic lymphangioma treatment, lacking the latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major muscles, corresponding to severe stage III Poland syndrome. Evaluation criteria included aesthetic results, patient satisfaction, functional impact, and the number of lipomodeling sessions needed.
Results
The BPF enabled thoraco-mammary restoration in all patients. Additional lipomodeling sessions achieved the desired morphological results. All outcomes were “very good,” with no flap necrosis or other complications. Patient satisfaction was rated “very good” in all cases.
Conclusion
The BPF is a valuable technique for treating severe thoraco-mammary deformities in Poland syndrome and should be part of the therapeutic arsenal for complex cases. However, it requires a delicate procedure by experienced plastic surgeons.}

This study aimed to explore the distribution and difference of orofacial two-point discrimination threshold (2-PDT) between patients with pain-related Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) and healthy individuals.
Methods
This study included 58 pain-related TMDs patients and 58 healthy individuals. Demographics including the gender, age of participants were collected. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ), mandible, zygomatic and temporal 2-PDTs were examined for statistical analyses.
Results
Pain-related TMDs patients showed significantly higher 2-PDTs in all tested regions (p < 0.001). In gender subgroups of the control, males had significantly higher 2-PDTs than females in bilateral TMJ and temporal regions. In gender subgroups of patients, no statistical 2-PDT differences were found between males and females. Pain-related TMDs females had higher 2-PDTs than control females in all regions, which were also observed between pain-related TMDs males and control males (p < 0.001), except for temporal 2-PDTs. Only pain-related TMDs were significantly associated with orofacial 2-PDTs with β coefficients varied from 3.5 to 7 (p < 0.001). The discrimination performance of 2-PDTs on pain-related TMDs was considered effective, while the TMJ 2-PDTs was the best single predictor (Area under curve: 0.833).
Conclusion
Pain-related TMDs patients had weaker orofacial tactile acuity, which was consistent in gender subgroups, except for the temporal region of males. Healthy males had weaker tactile acuity compared to females in TMJ and temporal regions. No significant gender effect on orofacial tactile acuity was observed among male and female patients. The 2-PDTs of the tested sites, especially for TMJ, has the potential for further utilization in pain-related TMDs patients.}

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a keystone of the public health response to HIV, making the support of adherence a point of focus in research and service delivery. Over the past decade, measurements of viral suppression have increasingly been used to evaluate interventions, with more robust study designs gaining traction. Effective approaches include adherence counselling beyond ART education (including mental health and wellbeing approaches), reducing burden of care, tackling structural and societal determinants of health, and using mHealth platforms to deliver interventions. Increasingly, single-strategy interventions are giving way to multicomponent approaches to respond to nuances in adherence behaviour. However, determining which effective strategy to offer and to whom, when, and how remain pressing questions if professionals in the field (eg, researchers, clinicians, and community health workers) are to reach the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals in the recent context of decreased funding. As new long-acting treatments enter global formularies, interventions showing success with oral ART will probably remain relevant to inform service delivery in most contexts.}

abstract = {Background
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective treatment for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, patient breathing can affect treatment accuracy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a bi-polar (BP) gated motion management strategy for SBRT and evaluate its feasibility geometrically and dosimetrically.
Methods
The BP strategy involved instructing patients to hold their breath briefly at the end of both inhalation (EI) and exhalation (EE), with radiation delivered only during these breath-holding periods. Eight volunteers were included to evaluate breathing stability, repeatability, and patient comfort. Additionally, 15 patients were retrospectively studied to evaluate the geometric and dosimetric efficiency of BP in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) modes. BP plans were compared with four common breathing strategies: free breathing (FB), gating at the end of inhalation (GI), gating at the end of exhalation (GE), and real-time tracking (RT).
Results
Volunteers could comfortably hold their breath for >3 minutes, demonstrating good stability and repeatability. Geometrically, the ratio of BP's internal target volume (ITV) to GI's ITV was the smallest at 0.65, compared to 1.89 for FB, 1.05 for GE, and 0.68 for RT. In the dosimetric evaluation of IMRT plans, the lung V20Gy ratio for BP to GI was the smallest at 0.89. Similar trends were observed for VMAT plans.
Conclusions
The BP strategy is a feasible option for lung SBRT, offering reduced treatment volumes and normal tissue toxicity, with a high duty cycle and less technical complexity than other RT-based methods.}

abstract = {Whereas the information systems literature mainly has focused on the individual user acceptance of technology, this study focuses on non-user acceptance, termed technology receptivity. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent an emerging technology that challenges individual technology user acceptance. Whereas AVs promise several advantages, their success is conditioned on public trust. AVs impact not only those who use them but also those who share the environment with them, such as bicyclists. Empirical research has been characterized by several competing constructs aimed at explaining AV receptivity. In this article, we (1) review extant research on the receptivity of AVs, and (2) develop and validate a model of AV receptivity. A cross-sectional survey of 219 bicyclists showed empirical support for the model. The model can be a useful tool for the AV industry and policymakers in need of assessing the likelihood of success for a wider AV diffusion and help them understand intervention strategies to address populations that may be less inclined to accept the new technology on public roads. We offer several recommendations for future research on refining the measurement instrument and enhancing our understanding of AV and autonomous technology receptivity.}

While the effects of sugars on metabolic diseases are well-known, the role of iron remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of a high-fat high-iron animal diet on body metabolism in mice. Micro-PET imaging was used to assess 18-F-labelled glucose uptake in BAT, and the morphology, respiratory function, and oxidative stress of BAT mitochondria were examined. The underlying mechanisms were elucidated by analyzing the expression of UCP-1, PGC-1α and PPARα. The high-iron high-fat diet increased appetite, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin sensitivity. Additionally, the high-iron diet promoted gluconeogenesis only in the absence of high-fat levels. Both high-iron and high-fat diets suppressed BAT activity, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, decreased mitochondrial respiratory function, and lowered thermogenic gene expression. Weight loss strategies focusing solely on reducing carbohydrates and increasing animal foods, like ketogenic diets, may have long-term detrimental effects on metabolic health. Prioritizing dietary diversity and monitoring overall caloric intake is advisable for optimal outcomes.}

abstract = {Background
Psychosocial intervention studies aimed at reducing stress among parents of children with cancer have historically included insufficient samples of African American parents. Pediatric oncology nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and address parent psychosocial needs. However, research exploring their perspectives to serve as psychosocial interventionists specifically for African American families of children with cancer is limited.
Objective
To explore the perspectives of pediatric oncology nurses on their role as psychosocial interventionists for African American families navigating childhood cancer.
Methods
We conducted 32 remote individual interviews and 2 focus groups (n = 4 each) with 40 pediatric oncology nurses from three pediatric cancer centers and a large pediatric oncology nursing organization. Using Corbin and Strauss’ Grounded Theory methodology, we used constant comparative analysis to generate a theory based on the nurses’ perspectives.
Results
Our emergent theory—Structurally Differential Care—had two major themes (psychosocial resource facilitators and psychosocial resource obstructors). Psychosocial resource facilitators: 1) appreciating families’ experiences, 2) longitudinal presence, 3) open communication, 4) holistic care, and 5) safe spaces mitigated structurally differential care. Nurses also identified: 1) difficulty with serious illness conversation, 2) lack of nursing experience, and 3) competing work demands as psychosocial resource obstructors that intensify structurally differential care.
Conclusion
This sample of pediatric oncology nurses described experiences that either bolstered or obstructed their psychosocial care provision, signaling potential opportunities for nurse-targeted interventions that may reduce factors contributing to disparities in the psychosocial care for African American families of children with cancer.}

abstract = {Objective
We evaluated the contributions of chronological age, comorbidity burden, and/or frailty in predicting 90-day readmission in patients undergoing degenerative scoliosis surgery.
Methods
Patients were identified through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Readmissions Database. Frailty was assessed using the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups frailty-defining indicator. Comorbidity was assessed using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were created to predict readmission using age, frailty, and/or ECI. Area under the curve (AUC) was compared using DeLong's test.
Results
A total of 8104 patients were identified. Readmission rate was 9.8%, with infection representing the most common cause (3.5%). Our first model utilized chronological age, ECI, and/or frailty as primary predictors. The combination of ECI + frailty + age performed best, but the inclusion of chronological age did not significantly improve performance compared to ECI + frailty alone (AUC 0.603 vs. 0.599, P = 0.290). A second model using only chronological age and frailty as primary predictors performed better, however the inclusion of chronological age worsened performance when compared to frailty alone (AUC 0.747 vs. 0.743, P = 0.043).
Conclusions
These data support frailty as a predictor of 90-day readmission within a nationally representative sample. Frailty alone performed better than combinations of ECI and age. Interestingly, the integration of chronological age did not dramatically improve the model's performance. Limitations include the use of a national registry and a single frailty index. This provides impetus to explore biological age, rather than chronological age, as a potential tool for surgical risk assessment.}

abstract = {Aims
The association of telomere length (TL) and coronary heart disease (CHD) is still debated, and there is a lack of dose-response meta-analyses on this issue. The aim is therefore to integrate existing evidence on the association between TL and CHD risk and explore the dose-response relationship between them.
Data synthesis
PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies up to September 2024. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with data presented as RRs and 95 % CIs. Restricted cubic splines were used to assess linear and nonlinear associations. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. Fourteen articles (8 prospective cohort studies, 2 case-cohort studies, 2 case-control studies, and 2 cross-sectional studies) were finally included in the meta-analysis, with a total sample size of 199,562 participants and 25,752 cases. For CHD, the total RR for the highest TL group compared to the lowest TL group was 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.61, 0.78, I2 = 64.5 %). For every 1 kilobase pair (kbp) increase in TL, the CHD risk decreased by 23 % (RR = 0.77, 95 % CI: 0.69, 0.87, I2 = 89.0 %). The nonlinearity test indicated a linear association between TL and CHD risk (Pnon-linearity = 0.930). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust.
Conclusions
The meta-analysis showed a linear relationship between TL and CHD. People with low TL may be more likely to develop CHD than those with high TL. The association between the two did not change in a wide range of populations.}

Structural representations of bias using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a unified approach to conceptualize bias, distinguish between different types of bias, and identify ways to address bias. DAG-based data simulation further enhances the scope of this approach. Recently, DAGs have been used to demonstrate how missing eligibility information can compromise emulated target trial analysis, a cutting edge approach to estimate treatment effects using real-world data. The importance of simulation for methodological research has received substantial recognition in the past few years, and others have argued that simulating data based on DAGs can be especially helpful for understanding various epidemiological concepts. In the present work, we present two concrete examples of how simulations based on DAGs can be used to gain insights into issues commonly encountered in real-world analytics, i.e., regression modelling to address confounding bias, and the potential extent of selection bias. Increasing accessibility and extending the simulation algorithms of existing software to include longitudinal and time-to-event data are identified as priorities for further development. With such extensions, simulations based on DAGs would be an even more powerful tool to advance our understanding of the rapidly growing toolbox of real-world analytics.}

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has increased faster in low- and middle-income countries. We determined how the COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the relationship between income level and prevalence of DM, disease management, and the use of primary care services.
Methods
Descriptive cross-sectional study. It included diabetic patients over 14 years of age residing in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria as of 31 December 2022. The results were compared with those of a pre-pandemic study in 2019.
Results
The prevalence of DM in 2022 in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria was almost identical to that of 2019, with a slight decrease in the low- and high-income groups, and an increase in the middle-income group. The average age of the population with DM increased. The average number of visits to the doctor increased, while visits to the nursing home decreased. A worsening of glycosylated hemoglobin and low-density lipoproteins was found in high and middle incomes. The trend was the opposite for body weight, with a 1.2% increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity in low incomes.
Conclusions
Lower incomes were associated with worse outcomes in terms of overweight and obesity. The situation of people with DM with overweight or obesity worsened compared to 2019 for the lower-income population.

Métodos
Estudio descriptivo transversal. Incluyó a pacientes diabéticos mayores de 14 años residentes en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria a 31 de diciembre de 2022. Los resultados se compararon con los de un estudio previo a la pandemia de 2019.
Resultados
La prevalencia de DM en 2022 en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria fue casi idéntica a la de 2019, con un ligero descenso en los grupos de rentas bajas y altas, y un aumento en el grupo de rentas medias. La edad media de la población con DM aumentó. El número medio de visitas al médico aumentó, mientras que las visitas a enfermería disminuyeron. Se encontró un empeoramiento de la glucohemoglobina y las lipoproteínas de baja densidad en los ingresos altos y medios. La tendencia fue la opuesta para el peso corporal, con un aumento del 1,2% en la prevalencia de sobrepeso/obesidad en los ingresos bajos.
Conclusiones
Los ingresos más bajos se asociaron a peores resultados en materia de sobrepeso y obesidad. La situación de las personas con DM con sobrepeso u obesidad empeoró en comparación con 2019 para la población de menores ingresos.}

abstract = {Background
Myelomeningocele (MMC) disproportionately affects low-resource areas and regions without mandatory folic acid fortification. No specific literature exists on the distribution of research output regarding neurosurgical management of myelomeningocele worldwide in relation to regional disease burden. We aimed to examine the country of origin and patient population of published papers on MMC and topics related to neurosurgical management of MMC, to determine whether these were proportionate to disease burden.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted on neurosurgical aspects of MMC care. The geographic distribution of neurosurgical MMC research output was examined against the national burden of disease. Bibliometric analysis quantified author and patient country affiliations stratified by World Bank income group classification and folic acid fortification status, juxtaposed with disease burden.
Results
From 9692 titles, 1843 were included, representing 107,446 patients and 2650 authorship instances. High-income countries (HICs) constituted 3% of 2019's global neural tube defect (NTD) births, 74% of authorships, and 83% of patients represented. Upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) represented 9% of NTD births, 16% of authorships, and 9% of published patients. Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) represented 55% of NTD births but only 8.6% of authorships and 7% of patients. Low-income countries (LICs) shouldered 32% of NTD births and contributed 1.3% of authorships and 1.6% of patients. Countries with mandatory folic acid fortification represented 75% of patients and 54% of authorships. Postnatal repair, hydrocephalus, and postoperative complications were the most frequently studied topics.
Conclusions
The global literature concerning neurosurgical management of myelomeningocele originates predominantly from HICs. Published experiences of myelomeningocele patients from LICs/LMICs are scarce, even though they constitute the majority of the affected population. Neurosurgeons and other health professionals must address this mismatch between disease burden and publication volume in order to inform practice, policy, and advocacy for MMC care worldwide.}

Glycerol, a by-product of the biodiesel industry, has garnered attention as a substrate for sustainable bioprocessing. This study investigates the metabolic adaptability of a newly isolated strain, Klebsiella variicola JYP01, focusing on glycerol utilization under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, as well as the potential of this strain as a proficient producer of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) in sustainable bioprocessing. The research explores the potential of K. variicola JYP01 as the efficient PDO producers with the emphasis on the integration of zero-valent iron (ZVI) to enhance energy production and PDO yield.
Methods
Isolation and characterization of the JYP01 strain, assessing its growth and PDO production under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and incorporating ZVI (as an electron donor) to identify the metabolic fluxes. Several analyses, including 16S rRNA analysis, high-performance liquid chromatography, and bio-electrochemical system reactors, were employed to elucidate metabolic strategies and the bioconversion efficiency of glycerol to PDO of JYP01 particularly with ZVI.
Significant findings
The integration of ZVI into the bioconversion process significantly enhanced PDO production, leading to 171 % increase from 44.0 mM to 75.2 mM. This demonstrates the distinct ability of the K. variicola JYP01 strain to utilize ZVI as an extra reducing energy in an anaerobic environment. The findings underscore this strain's metabolic capacity, its suitability for glycerol conversion on a large scale, and the novel strategy of using ZVI to elevate PDO production, advancing sustainable bioprocessing techniques.}

When peanut shell was used as carrier, the maximum H2 yield of 1.7 L and H2 production rate of 0.58 L/L/d were obtained at HRT of 6 h, which were nearly 20 % and 15 % higher than that of plastic pellet as carriers, respectively. The hydrogen production system with peanut shell as carriers had better hydrogen production capacity and immobilized effect, since peanut shell provided a supplementary substrate for the growth and metabolism of hydrogen producing bacteria, and buffered the acidity of the system. This study provided an application for immobilization technology and the industrialization of bio-hydrogen production.}

abstract = {Liver failure, either acute (ALF) or acute-on-chronic (ACLF), is characterized by hepatocellular dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and multiorgan failure, leading to high mortality without liver transplantation (LT). However, LT is limited by organ shortages and medical contraindications, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. Biological liver support systems, incorporate functional hepatocytes to partially restore hepatic metabolic functions, though clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit. Artificial systems, such as albumin dialysis (MARS, Prometheus), facilitate toxin removal, though evidence remains limited. Continuous renal replacement therapy, while not specific for liver failure, is essential in patients with severe hyperammonemia or acute kidney injury, aiding in ammonia clearance and fluid balance control. Plasma exchange (PE) has promising detoxification and immunomodulatory effects, improving survival in ALF. In ACLF, PE may reduce systemic inflammation, though evidence remains limited. Further studies are needed to optimize ECLS therapies, refine patient selection, and establish their role in ALF and ACLF management.
Resumen
La insuficiencia hepática, ya sea aguda (IHA) o aguda sobre crónica (ACLF), se caracteriza por disfunción hepatocelular, inflamación sistémica y fallo multiorgánico, con una alta mortalidad en ausencia de trasplante hepático (TH). Sin embargo, el TH está limitado por la escasez de órganos y contraindicaciones médicas, lo que ha motivado el desarrollo de terapias de soporte extracorpóreo. Los sistemas de soporte hepático biológico, diseñados para restaurar funciones metabólicas mediante hepatocitos funcionales, no se utilizan actualmente en la práctica clínica. Entre los sistemas artificiales, técnicas como MARS y Prometheus permiten la eliminación de toxinas unidas a albúmina, aunque su uso ha disminuido y no han demostrado beneficio en la supervivencia. La terapia de reemplazo renal continua es útil en pacientes con hiperamoniemia o lesión renal aguda. El intercambio plasmático ha demostrado beneficios en la IHA y podría tener un rol en el ACLF. Se requieren estudios para definir su papel clínico.}

Two pathologists independently evaluated the microscopic descriptions and diagnoses using a predefined scoring system (0–4 for microscopic descriptions and 0–2 for pathological diagnoses), with higher scores indicating greater accuracy. Microscopic descriptions that received perfect scores, which included all relevant keywords and findings, were then presented to the standard version of ChatGPT to assess its diagnostic capabilities based on these descriptions. GPT-4 showed consistency in microscopic description and diagnosis scores across five rounds, accomplishing median scores of 50 % and 48.6 %, respectively. However, its performance was still inferior to junior and senior pathology residents (73.9 % and 93.9 % description scores and 63.9 % and 87.9 % diagnosis scores, respectively). When analyzing classic ChatGPT's understanding of microscopic descriptions provided by residents, it correctly diagnosed 35 (87.5 %) of cases from junior residents and 44 (68.8 %) from senior residents, given that the initial descriptions consisted of keywords and relevant findings. While GPT-4 can accurately interpret some histopathological images, its overall performance is currently inferior to that of pathology residents. However, ChatGPT's ability to accurately interpret and diagnose diseases from the descriptions provided by residents suggests that this technology could serve as a valuable support tool in pathology diagnostics.}

By capturing and merging spatio-temporal features from relevant events, the proposed GCN-LSTM model achieves remarkable accuracy in predicting terrorist attacks. The experimental results demonstrate outstanding performance, with the model attaining minimal RMSE and MAE values of 0.037 and 0.031, respectively, surpassing all baseline models (LSTM, GCN, and CNN-LSTM-Transformer). Through its effective interpretation of complex spatio-temporal patterns underlying terrorist attacks, our model substantially enhances the predictive accuracy across diverse time horizons.

abstract = {Introduction
Septic surgical patients undergoing emergency general surgery represent a distinct population with unique challenges. This study aimed to identify predictors of cumulative 90-d mortality, including clinical and socioeconomic factors, and to analyze causes of death in this cohort.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients admitted to a surgical intensive care unit from 2011 to 2019 with sepsis (sequential organ failure assessment score ≥2) undergoing emergency intra-abdominal surgery (n = 498). Demographics, comorbidities, sepsis presentation, and socioeconomic metrics, including the area deprivation index (ADI), were analyzed. Independent predictors of mortality were identified using multiple logistic regression. The causes of death were categorized and analyzed.
Results
Among 498 patients, 46% (n = 229) died within 90 d. Nonsurvivors were older (65 ± 13.7 versus 61.2 ± 13.5 y, P < 0.01), more often transferred from external facilities (59% versus 46%, P < 0.01), and had higher rates of liver disease, chronic kidney disease, metastatic cancer, obesity, and higher Charlson comorbidity index scores (P < 0.01 for all). Independent predictors of 90-d mortality included admission sequential organ failure assessment scores, serum lactate, obesity, ADI, Charlson comorbidity index, and transfer status. ADI remained a significant predictor, while the distressed communities index did not. Of the deaths, 76.9% were in-hospital deaths, with intra-abdominal catastrophes (35.4%), multisystem organ failure (25.2%), and pulmonary causes (16.4%) as the most common causes.
Conclusions
Intra-abdominal catastrophes, multiorgan failure, and pulmonary complications are leading causes of death in septic emergency general surgery patients. ADI is a robust socioeconomic predictor of mortality, underscoring the need for integrating social determinants into risk assessment and tailored care strategies. Developing comprehensive risk models may enhance prognostication and guide clinical decision-making in this critical population.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical risk prediction models integrated into digitized health care informatics systems hold promise for personalized primary prevention and care, a core goal of precision health. Fairness metrics are important tools for evaluating potential disparities across sensitive features, such as sex and race or ethnicity, in the field of prediction modeling. However, fairness metric usage in clinical risk prediction models remains infrequent, sporadic, and rarely empirically evaluated.
Objective
We seek to assess the uptake of fairness metrics in clinical risk prediction modeling through an empirical evaluation of popular prediction models for 2 diseases, 1 chronic and 1 infectious disease.
Methods
We conducted a scoping literature review in November 2023 of recent high-impact publications on clinical risk prediction models for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and COVID-19 using Google Scholar.
Results
Our review resulted in a shortlist of 23 CVD-focused articles and 22 COVID-19 pandemic–focused articles. No articles evaluated fairness metrics. Of the CVD-focused articles, 26% used a sex-stratified model, and of those with race or ethnicity data, 92% had study populations that were more than 50% from 1 race or ethnicity. Of the COVID-19 models, 9% used a sex-stratified model, and of those that included race or ethnicity data, 50% had study populations that were more than 50% from 1 race or ethnicity. No articles for either disease stratified their models by race or ethnicity.
Conclusions
Our review shows that the use of fairness metrics for evaluating differences across sensitive features is rare, despite their ability to identify inequality and flag potential gaps in prevention and care. We also find that training data remain largely racially and ethnically homogeneous, demonstrating an urgent need for diversifying study cohorts and data collection. We propose an implementation framework to initiate change, calling for better connections between theory and practice when it comes to the adoption of fairness metrics for clinical risk prediction. We hypothesize that this integration will lead to a more equitable prediction world.}

abstract = {Background:
Regulatory authorities issued precautionary recommendations on the use of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) following the ORAL Surveillance trial [1], which demonstrated an elevated risk of cancer with tofacitinib, compared to TNF inhibitors (TNFi). While these findings have influenced clinical guidance, there is still limited real-world evidence on malignancy risks associated with JAKi treatment.
Objectives:
To assess the incidence of cancer in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with JAKi, compared to other biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), using data from a large, multi-country, real-world population.
Methods:
We studied patients from 13 RA registers across Europe and Québec, starting JAKi, TNFi -inhibitors (TNFi) or bDMARDs with other modes of action (OMA). Outcomes of interest were categorized into cancer excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC); and NMSC cases. Cancers were linked to treatments within 5 years of cessation or until follow-up loss, death, or study end, whichever came first. Incidence rates (IR) per 100 patient-years (PY) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. Poisson regression, with propensity score weighting (including country, disease-, and patient-characteristics, and comorbidities, see Figure 1), was used to obtain adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR), with 95% CI. A sub-analysis was performed on patients aged ≥ 50 years and ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factor, mimicking the “ORAL Surveillance” trial inclusion criteria (high risk cohort).
Results:
Over the 53'169 treatment initiations considered in 33'127 patients, 638 cancers excluding NMSC and 219 NMSC were reported. Crude incidence of cancer excluding NMSC was lower for TNFi (2.2/1000 PY) than for JAKi (2.9/1000 PY) and OMA (3.1/1000 PY). The adjusted Poisson regression found no significant difference in the incidence of cancer excluding NMSC (aIRR = 1.10; 95% CI [0.89; 1.37]) or NMSC (aIRR = 1.12; 95% CI [0.78; 1.60]) between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA (aIRR = 1.07; 95% CI [0.86; 1.32] and aIRR = 0.79; 95% CI [0.54; 1.15] respectively). The high risk cohort accounted for 39.4% of treatment courses and had a higher incidence of cancer in each treatment group (OMA: 4.1/1000 PY, JAKi: 4.2/1000 PY, TNFi: 3.2/1000 PY). Similarly to the overall population, no significant difference in the incidence of cancer excluding NMSC (aIRR = 1.16; 95% CI [0.86; 1.57]) and NMSC (aIRR = 1.15; 95% CI [0.71; 1.84]) was observed between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA (aIRR = 1.09; 95% CI [0.81; 1.47] and aIRR = 0.92; 95% CI [0.58; 1.46] respectively).
Conclusion:
In this real-world study, including 13 RA registers and all currently available JAKi, we did not find a significantly higher risk of cancer excluding NMSC or of NMSC in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to bDMARDs (TNFi or OMA). Further analyses are planned, including the inclusion of additional registries to enhance statistical power and the evaluation of incidence across different exposure periods.

To evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of three Artificial intelligence (AI) models—GPT-4o, Canva-GPT, and ECG Reader-GPT—against emergency medicine specialists (EMSs) in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation using a standardized and validated test set.
Methods
In this prospective diagnostic accuracy study, 50 ECG questions were selected from the reference text 150 ECG Cases. Thirty EMSs completed the test once; each AI model was evaluated on the same test set daily over 30 consecutive days. Diagnostic accuracy was compared across predefined ECG subcategories and clinical case types.
Results
EMSs achieved the highest overall diagnostic accuracy (median: 41.5; IQR: 37.0–43.0), followed closely by ECG Reader-GPT (median: 39.5; IQR: 39.0–41.0), with no statistically significant difference between them (p = 0.530). ECG Reader-GPT significantly outperformed both GPT-4o and Canva-GPT across all case categories (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ECG Reader-GPT performed comparably to EMSs in identifying ischemic syndromes, channelopathies and genetic syndromes, and normal ECGs (all p < 0.05); it surpassed them in interpreting rhythm disorders (p = 0.007).
Conclusion
ECG Reader-GPT, a customized AI model for ECG interpretation, demonstrated diagnostic accuracy comparable to experienced EMSs and significantly outperformed general-purpose models across all ECG subcategories. These findings highlight the value of domain specialization in developing clinically effective AI tools.}

abstract = {Background
Treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) differs based on MI type, which can be difficult to determine in the emergency department. This study sought to evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm (MI3) in combination with N-Terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) can accurately differentiate MI type.
Methods
We conducted a secondary analysis of the multisite CMR-IMPACT trial, which prospectively enrolled adults with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome and an initial indeterminate troponin. Patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of MI and an initial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI; Abbott Laboratories) measure were included. Incidence of MI and MI type were adjudicated by expert reviewers. Receiver operator characteristic curves for MI-type were created and area under the curve (AUC) calculated for MI3 and MI3 with NT-proBNP and Gal-3. AUCs were compared using DeLong’s method.
Results
Among 123 patients with adjudicated MI, the mean age was 60±12 years and 37.4% (46/123) were female. Type 1 MI occurred in 58.5% (72/123) and type 2 MI in 41.5% (51/123). MI3 based on an initial hs-cTnI yielded an AUC of 0.704 (95% CI 0.611-0.797) for MI type. When combined with NT-proBNP and Gal-3, AUC improved to 0.789 (95% CI 0.709-0.869, p=0.0165). In patients with serial hs-cTnIs (n = 86), the AUC of MI3 for MI type was 0.721 (95% CI 0.614-0.829) and increased to 0.797 (95% CI 0.700-0.894, p=0.09) with the addition of NT-proBNP and Gal-3.
Conclusion
Adding NT-proBNP and Gal-3 to the MI3 machine learning algorithm shows promise in differentiating type 1 from type 2 MI.}

abstract = {In 2025 alone, H5N1 avian influenza is responsible for thousands of infections across various animal species, including avian and mammalian livestock such as chickens and cows, and poses a threat to human health due to avian-to-mammalian transmission. There have been 70 human cases of H5N1 influenza in the United States since April 2024 and, as shown in recent studies, our current antibody defenses are waning. Thus, it is imperative to discover new therapeutics in the fight against more recent strains of the virus. In this study, we present the Frankies framework for automated antibody diffusion and assessment. This pipeline was used to automate the generation of 30 novel anti-HA1 Fv antibody fragment sequences, fold them into 3-dimensional structures, and then dock against a recent H5N1 HA1 antigen structure for binding evaluation. Here we show the utility of artificial intelligence in the discovery of novel antibodies against specific H5N1 strains of interest, which bind similarly to known therapeutic and elicited antibodies.}

abstract = {Purpose
Large language models, a subset of artificial intelligence, have immense potential to support human tasks. The role of these models in science and medicine is unclear, requiring strong critical thinking and analysis skills. The objective of our study was to evaluate GPT-4's abilities to assess postoperative complications after renal surgeries.
Materials and methods
Discharge summaries were compiled, and patient information was deidentified in a Python-based program. Prompts were engineered in GPT-4 to assess for the presence of postoperative complications. GPT-4 was further asked to interpret each complication's Clavien-Dindo classification and institutional-specific category. GPT-4's database was compared to a human-curated database. Discrepancies were manually reviewed to calculate match and accuracy rates.
Results
Approximately 944 renal surgeries were conducted from August 2005 to March 2022. There was a 79.6% match rate between GPT-4 and human-curated data in detecting postoperative complications. Accuracy rates were 86.7% for GPT-4 and 92.9% for human-curated. A subgroup of 139 patients had a complication detected by both GPT-4 and human with available Clavien-Dindo classification and category information. There was a 37.4% overall match rate for Clavien-Dindo grade and 55.4% match rate for category.
Conclusions
GPT-4 was able to accurately detect if there were any postoperative complications. It struggled with the complex task of further analyzing complications, especially with Clavien-Dindo classification, which requires more critical thinking and interpretation. While GPT-4 is not yet ready for advanced postoperative complication analysis, it can still be used to support clinicians in this endeavor.}

abstract = {Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by high relapse and mortality rates. Our previous investigation identified enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing protein 3 (ECHDC3) as being of prognostic significance in AML; however, the underlying pathways remain elusive. The intricate crosstalk among genetic abnormalities, metabolic pathways, and protein dysfunctions underpins the complexity contributing to its poor prognosis.
Methods
ECHDC3 was knocked down by siRNA and subjected to RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and metabolomic assessments. Cell culture media were subjected to metabolomic assessments to evaluate changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. Mass spectrometry was conducted on bone marrow leukemia stem cells (CD34+) from chemotherapy-sensitive (S) and chemotherapy-resistant (R) patients. Additionally, untargeted metabolomic sequencing was performed on bone marrow supernatants from this patient cohort, and a combined proteomic-metabolomic analysis was conducted on the sequencing results from paired samples.
Results
Knockdown of ECHDC3 significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (p < 0.0001), increased the mitochondrial DNA copy number MT-CO1 (p = 0.0367) and MT-CO2 (p = 0.0081), and enhanced manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity (p = 0.0003). Significant differences were observed in choline metabolism in cancer (p = 0.0063), linoleic acid (p = 0.0160), and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism (p = 0.0250) between the R and S groups. Furthermore, correlation analysis of proteomic and metabolomic data suggested that choline and glycerophospholipid metabolism may play pivotal roles in the development of chemotherapy resistance in AML.
Conclusions
ECHDC3 contributes to chemotherapy resistance in AML by regulating mitochondrial function, autophagy, and metabolic pathways. This study highlights ECHDC3 as a potential therapeutic target and offers insights into the development of AML treatments to overcome drug resistance.}

abstract = {Background
Hearing loss affects an estimated 30 million individuals in the United States significantly affecting communication, social engagement, and overall quality of life. In August 2022, the Food and Drug Administration published its final rule creating a regulatory category for over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Few studies have assessed pharmacists’ readiness to provide patient support for these devices.
Objective
This qualitative study assessed pharmacist adoption and sustainable implementation of pharmacist-provided OTC hearing aids.
Methods
Community pharmacists were invited to participate in focus groups through self-selection via electronic invitations sent from the institution’s continuing professional development e-mail listserv. An interview guide was developed based on selected constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). A thematic analysis was conducted on the transcribed interviews and coded by investigators. Focus groups were conducted until a point of saturation was reached (4 focus groups, 23 participants). Qualitative results spanned all 5 CFIR domains.
Results
Pharmacists viewed convenience and accessibility as major advantages offered by OTC hearing aids and felt the sale of OTC hearing aids fit logically within existing pharmacy workflow. However, they cited a lack of knowledge, skills, and training on the subject and devices, which influenced their reported lack of motivation and commitment to engage in selling OTC hearing aids. Pharmacists expressed frustration with the complex nature of these devices, noting significant variances in quality, technological sophistication, and cost.
Conclusion
Findings from our study clearly indicate a need for training and education opportunities for pharmacists who offer or will offer OTC hearing aids. Establishing a collaborative relationship with audiologists may help bridge the gap in knowledge and skills for pharmacists.}
