abstract = {Amidst the therapeutic quandaries associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive malignancy distinguished by its immune resistance and limited treatment avenues, the urgent need for innovative solutions is underscored. To conquer the dilemma, we present a groundbreaking approach that ingeniously employs DNA-fragments-containing exosomes (DNA-Exo) and the concept of “biological logic-gates” to achieve precise homing and controlled selective activation of ferroptosis and stimulator interferon genes (STING) pathways. Leveraging insights from our previous research, a nano-Trojan-horse, Fe0@HMON@DNA-Exo, is engineered via in situ Fe0 synthesis within the glutathione (GSH)-responsiveness degradable hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (HMON) and subsequently enveloped in DNA-Exo derived from 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38)-treated 4T1 cells. Emphasizing the precision of our approach, the DNA-Exo ensures specific ‘homing’ to TNBC cells, rendering a targeted delivery mechanism. Concurrently, the concept of “biological logic-gates” is employed to dictate a meticulous and selective activation of STING in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) under OR logic-gating with robust immune response and Fe0-based ferroptosis in TNBC cells under AND logic-gating with reactive oxygen species (ROS) storm generation. In essence, our strategy exhibits great potential in transforming the “immunologically cold” nature of TNBC, enabling precise control over cellular responses, illuminating a promising therapeutic paradigm that is comprehensive and productive in pursuing precision oncology and paving the way for personalized TNBC therapies.}

Existing research suggests feedback seeking may be essential to student feedback literacy, but few studies explore this issue in relation to specific high-need populations. This study examined Chinese international students’ practices and perceptions of feedback seeking in writing assessments during their first years at an Australian university. Thirty-seven participants from three faculties participated in 14 individual interviews and seven focus groups. Data were analysed using thematic analysis protocols. Encountered challenges were grouped into epistemological, ontological, and practical dimensions. Findings indicate that students drew upon various sources for inquiry and monitoring at the stages of planning and preparation, revising before submission, and reacting after getting results. Implications include the importance of creating low-threshold opportunities for facilitating learners’ feedback seeking. Findings also suggest that educators’ enhanced understanding of students' educational identity and epistemological beliefs may improve students’ feedback-seeking practices.}

Moreover, their mediating capacities are often mythicized, to such an extent that one might surmise the direct transmission of the mental images from the designer's consciousness to an external representation. In this speculative essay, we demonstrate that the process of representation at work in architectural design originates from the designer's consciousness natural cognitive ability, rather than from the use of a specific mediation tool between the designer and his environment, between the mentally constructed architectural project and its representation. The effects of any tool of representation—analog or digital—on our perceptual apparatus depend primarily on the cognitive mechanisms affecting the discontinuous flow of internal representations formed by our consciousness. In other words, we propose to shed a new light on these limitations through the heuristic modeling of an architectural project designer confronted with his own cognitive biases, and the limits of the representation processes. In the present essay, the discontinuities and uncertainties inherent to the processes of representation are reintegrate in the models.}

Employing weighted least squares, the study estimates expected AIPI scores and classifies countries as global or local overperformers if their observed scores exceed predictions and surpass income-group medians. The analysis identifies 10 high-income global overperformers and 14 local overperformers across middle- and low-income groups, revealing regulation and ethics as universal drivers of overperformance, with digital infrastructure and human capital varying by economic context. Case studies elucidate diverse coordination models—state-led, market-responsive, and distributed innovation—while highlighting transferability constraints due to institutional and historical factors, among others. The replicable methodology provides policymakers and other key actors a robust tool to benchmark AI readiness and design context-specific strategies, addressing the global AI divide.

Modeling is an indispensable tool in multi-physics transfer understanding and offers a promising pathway for electrode structural designs and material architecture selections. Despite the progress, the modeling community continues to face significant challenges, including oversimplification, difficulties in coupling complex features, unclear physical knowledge, and unavoidable discrepancies. This perspective highlights the current status of porous electrode modeling, identifies ongoing challenges, and explores future directions for key technologies and potential countermeasures. Specifically, the characteristics and limitations of macro-scale, meso-scale, and micro-scale models regarding intricate porous electrode microstructures are compared, including ordered structure, mesoporous carbon support, various catalyst architectures, etc. Potential solutions to these challenges are proposed for the next generation of porous electrode designs. Furthermore, three alternatives to advancing cross-scale, full-morphology, and full-coupling modeling are developed and discussed, including layer-by-layer physical property transfer, interfacial data transfer and direct numerical simulation, and data-driven assisted cross-scale modeling, which are expected to be evaluated and validated in the foreseeable future.}

It is timely in integrating both technical and critical guidance for methodological innovations in the field of applied linguistics. To illustrate how this aim is achieved, this article first justifies the significance and theoretical basis of TRNI by elaborating on the definitions of and underpinning rationale for it, followed by the relationship among second language (L2) learners, investment, and TRNI. It then discusses the methods adopted by the 69 most cited empirical studies from Google Scholar that used the model of L2 investment as the theoretical model and compares these methods with TRNI. Finally, it discusses how TRNI was developed and adopted in two action research projects conducted by the author and two lecturers among local undergraduate students in the Hong Kong context. Through these steps, I demonstrate how TRNIs can be adopted or adapted to provide an interactive space for ESL learners to reconstruct and perform their English speaker and learner identities, share their learning experiences with the agency to introduce their positions, voices, and stories, and therefore, claim legitimacy as English users in EMI courses.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) is an automated method that generates the content according to its knowledge and the intent information. Deploying the AIGC model in edge networks unlocks new possibilities. Unfortunately, realizing AIGC in distributed edge networks faces critical challenges, including the interdependent control decisions, the complex trade-offs between energy consumption and total variation (TV) distance, the extension of TV distance due to insufficient denoising steps, the restriction of AIGC inferencing deadlines, and the uncertainty of AIGC task arrivals. In this paper, targeting AIGC tasks, we design polynomial-time online algorithms to overcome all these challenges. Firstly, we formulate distributed AIGC as a non-linear mixed-integer program for long-term total cost optimization. Subsequently, we propose a novel algorithmic approach that generates candidate inferencing schedules, reformulates the original problem into a new schedule selection problem, and solves this new problem using an online primal–dual-based algorithm. Moreover, we rigorously prove that our approach leads to a constant competitive ratio for the long-term total cost. Through extensive evaluations using real-world data, the superior practical performance of our approach is demonstrated, reducing the total cost by more than 50% compared to various alternative methods.}

Despite their effectiveness, traditional treatment approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery frequently have negative side effects and high costs. New approaches, such as gene therapy, are promising but are hampered by high costs and accessibility problems. Nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate targeted drug delivery by leveraging passive targeting mechanisms, such as the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and by actively targeting surfaces with ligands for site-specific binding through the functionalization of surfaces. This approach enhances therapeutic results while lowering off-target toxicities. Notably, chemotherapeutic medications, immunotherapeutic agents, and photothermal therapies can now be delivered more precisely to the affected site using NP-based systems. By boosting particularity, reducing side effects, and tackling drug resistance, nanomedicine has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and ultimately advance personalized oncological care.

Most existing models for de novo peptide design are largely based on sequence homology that can be restricted based on evolutionarily derived protein sequences and lack the physicochemical context essential in protein folding. Generative machine learning for de novo peptide design is a promising way to synthesize theoretical data that are based on, but unique from, the observable universe. In this study, we created and tested a custom peptide generative adversarial network intended to design peptide sequences that can fold into the β-hairpin secondary structure. This deep neural network model is designed to establish a preliminary foundation of the generative approach based on physicochemical and conformational properties of 20 canonical amino acids, for example, hydrophobicity and residue volume, using extant structure-specific sequence data from the PDB. The beta generative adversarial network model robustly distinguishes secondary structures of β hairpin from α helix and intrinsically disordered peptides with an accuracy of up to 96% and generates artificial β-hairpin peptide sequences with minimum sequence identities around 31% and 50% when compared against the current NCBI PDB and nonredundant databases, respectively. These results highlight the potential of generative models specifically anchored by physicochemical and conformational property features of amino acids to expand the sequence-to-structure landscape of proteins beyond evolutionary limits.}

However, an increased demand and availability of these tools do not imply a successful switch from traditional to AI-supported learning. In this work, ChatGMP, a chatbot leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) able to conduct an interview exercise in a Master's Degree course taught at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), is introduced. The exercise consists in a student interview of a fictitious company, represented by the teachers or ChatGMP, regarding its Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). The aim is for the students to ask sensible and well-reasoned questions to acquire the necessary documentation to make an exhaustive report indicating whether the company is a potential fit for business. To evaluate the initiative, we compare the performance of ChatGMP to the one of the physical teachers of the course, as well as the perception of the students towards it. The results show no significant difference in the information provided by the teachers and the model, enabling the students to achieve similar learning. The students that interacted with ChatGMP are satisfied with the initiative and would likely recommend future students to perform the audit with the digital tool. This initial experiment and its positive results lay the foundation for opening the discussion on how to use LLMs in education, the opportunities they could provide, as well as their limitations and drawbacks.}

abstract = {Hypoxia, a defining feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME), significantly contributes to cancer progression by influencing immune regulation, promoting angiogenesis, altering metabolic pathways, and driving uncontrolled cell proliferation. This review explores the diverse functions of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling in cancer development and progression, providing a comprehensive overview of the molecular pathways. HIFs, particularly HIF-1α and HIF-2α, regulate several genes related to cancer hallmarks such as invasion, metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and therapy resistance, thus mediating a significant portion of the hypoxic response. Hydroxylation of proline and asparagine residues in HIF-α subunits, which occurs in an oxygen-dependent manner, serves as a key regulatory mechanism for both their stability and transcriptional function. Notably, this complex interaction is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/ protein kinase B/ mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR), and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways. In cancer, HIF signaling affects several aspects of tumor cell biology that contribute to the cancerous characteristic, including angiogenesis induction through the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, metabolic reprogramming through the enhancement of the Warburg effect, facilitation of cancer invasion and metastasis by driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and matrix remodeling patterns, and mediation of therapeutic resistance partly due to the effects on drug efflux pumps and DNA damage repair. Several types of direct and indirect inhibitors, including small molecule inhibitors, peptidomimetics, antibodies, and PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras, are being investigated for therapeutic potential. Preclinical and early clinical trials have demonstrated significant synergistic effects in inhibiting tumor development when HIF inhibition is combined with traditional therapies (chemotherapy or radiation) or immunotherapies, emphasizing major clinical implications and the potential for improving patient outcomes. Although challenges exist, particularly regarding drug resistance, further research to improve therapeutic efficacy and prolong survival for patients is warranted.}

abstract = {Trinucleotide repeat expansions fold into long, stable hairpins and cause a variety of incurable RNA gain-of-function diseases such as Huntington’s disease, the myotonic dystrophies, and spinocerebellar ataxias. One approach for treating these diseases is to bind small molecules to these structured RNAs. Both Huntington’s disease-like 2 (HDL2) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are caused by a r(CUG) repeat expansion, or r(CUG)exp. The RNA folds into a hairpin structure with a periodic array of 1 × 1 nucleotide UU loops (5′CUG/3′GUC; where the underlined nucleotides indicate the Us in the internal loop) that sequester various RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and hence the source of its gain-of-function. Here, we report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-refined structures of single 5′CUG/3′GUC motifs in complex with three different small molecules, a di-guandinobenzoate (1), a derivative of 1 where the guanidino groups have been exchanged for imidazole (2), and a quinoline with improved drug-like properties (3). These structures were determined using NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics (MD). Compounds 1, 2, and 3 formed stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5′CUG/3′GUC motif. Compound 3 also formed van der Waals interactions with the internal loop. The global structure of each RNA-small molecule complexes retains an A-form conformation, while the internal loops are still dynamic but to a lesser extent compared to the unbound form. These results aid our understanding of ligand-RNA interactions and enable structure-based design of small molecules with improved binding affinity for and biological activity against r(CUG)exp. As the first ever reported structures of a r(CUG) repeat bound to ligands, these structures can enable virtual screening campaigns combined with machine learning assisted de novo design.}

abstract = {Children are increasingly engaging in dialogue and interactions with generative AI agents that can mimic human behaviors, raising questions about how children perceive and communicate with AI compared to humans. In an experimental study with 119 children aged 4–8, participants co-created stories in three conditions: with a generative AI agent via a speaker, with a physically present human partner, or with a human partner who was hidden and audible only through a speaker. Results showed a clear distinction in children's communication and perception of visible human partners compared to AI. Nuanced differences also emerged in children's perceptions of hidden human partners versus AI. When physical appearance was absent, children relied on linguistic and paralinguistic cues to assess human-likeness and form perceptions, but physical appearance became a more dominant factor when available. These results shed light on implications for the design of child-facing AI technologies, offering insights into how speech and physical features can be optimized to meet children's developmental and communicative needs.}

abstract = {The increasingly complicated urban traffic patterns lead traffic signal control to a new trend of higher flexibility and quicker response, which becomes possible with advances in both sensor technology and artificial intelligence. Though in its early stage, existing intelligent signal controllers equipped with reinforcement learning (RL)-based feature extractor and large language model (LLM)-driven scenario understanding and decision support already demonstrate powerful data digesting ability. This study thus proposes a smart traffic light control system integrating a vision-based perception tool to extract traffic state from real-time snapshot image of the intersection, and an LLM agent controller for signal phase switching upon scenario analysis. An indicator describing the urgency for green time at phase level is defined to abstract the contextual information regarding the competition of multiple approaching traffic flows, which augments the LLM with domain-specific logical reasoning for signal control action generation, aimed at assigning green time to the flows with the most compelling needs. With a RL-based controller providing initial control decision as backup, the proposed method is able to handle both pre-trained and out-of-distribution scenarios through real-time traffic state diagnosis and knowledgeable reasoning. Simulation evaluation on different intersection layouts and vehicle compositions is conducted with horizontal comparison of five benchmarks. A decrease in average waiting time was realized by more than 5 % under normal traffic scenario and 20 % under emergency vehicle scenario, respectively. Further, comprehensive analysis was conducted to explore the applicability of the proposed method and feasibility for real-world application in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based intelligent traffic management.}

In this paper, we propose a four-stage detection framework for ESTs that maps emerging attributes from paper entities to scientific topics. Empirical studies based on two significantly different disciplinary datasets, IS-LS, and AI, which contain 73,601 and 255,620 publications, respectively, are employed to validate our approach. First, we generate 29 and 47 candidate scientific topics based on topic modeling, respectively. Second, we represent the novelty of paper entities based on pre-trained language models, which is mapped to scientific topic entities along with knowledge distributions to obtain topic emerging attributes: topic novelty, relative share and growth. Third, we propose to predict future trends of these attributes with Neural Prophet, which outperforms four baseline models in R2, MAE and RMSE. Finally, combining future values of candidate scientific topics, they are grouped into 8 clusters containing two ESTs types through strategic market theory and clustering model. From the correlation and feature distribution analysis of emerging attributes, we discover the existence of resilience and scale advantage in the diffusion of scientific knowledge. There also exists significant uncertainty in previous citation-based scientific topic evaluation patterns caused by the complexity of citation behavior. Overall, this research enriches theoretical knowledge and detection frameworks of ESTs, and provides detailed insights into comprehensive assessment and dissemination of scientific topics.}

The artificial intelligence-based restoration of digitized artwork images can guide the artists in physically restoring the damaged artworks. Previous methods have not been able to restore artwork images well. This paper proposes a dual (spatial and channel) attention and channel transformer-based generative adversarial network to restore damaged artwork images digitally. The proposed generative adversarial network has spatial and channel attention layers in the encoder part of the generator and a channel transformer between skip connections from the encoder to the decoder part of the generator. Spatial and channel attention helps learn inter-spatial and inter-channel global relationships among image features. Channel transformer ensures multiscale feature fusion and reduces the semantic gap between encoder and decoder layer features. Moreover, the proposed network has been trained using a linear combination of perceptual, adversarial, and structured similarity index measure loss, which helps better train the network. Further, the proposed network has been validated on two different datasets, and the results indicate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art artwork restoration methods.}

In this paper, we introduce a Dynamic Attribute-guided Few-shot Open-set Network (DAFON), representing the first effort to simultaneously address closed-set classification and open-set recognition in rare disease diagnosis. To alleviate incomprehensive category knowledge stemming from data scarcity, we propose a Global Attribute Generator to create attributes and produce image attribute activations for closed-set data as auxiliary information. An attribute space is then constructed and employed to generate the pseudo open-set attribute activations using a designed Open-set Data Sampler. By incorporating closed-set and open-set attribute activations as conditions, we propose a Dynamic Attribute Guided Alignment module to align feature space with attribute space, so as to derive feature space with intra-class compactness for closed-set and open-set classes. Our DAFON achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public medical image datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for FSOSR in medical image diagnosis.}

However, users’ emotion expression is from three-dimensional automobile entities, with a single perspective potentially causing deviations. Thus, this paper presents a novel automobile exterior emotion design method based on deep learning and multiple views imagery integrating calculation. This approach enables a seamless transition from users’ emotional needs to automobile exterior design. First, we explore users’ emotional evaluation of automobile exterior using the semantic differential method. The improved model of ResNet101-Attention mechanism was used to predict users’ emotion. Additionally, based on above emotional evaluation values, this study proposed a calculation method of multiple views automobile imagery integrating using the Analytic Hierarchy Process and Entropy Weight, calculate the automobile imagery weights of different views, and obtain the final automobile exterior emotional imagery. Finally, the Captum toolkit and the LoRA fine-tuning training technique are used to construct an automobile exterior design optimization generation model, producing a design that meets users’ emotion needs. By comparing the results obtained using both manual and automatic evaluations, and comparing to classical deep learning models. we verify the model’s validity and the advantages of the proposed method. This intelligent method assists designers in quickly identifying users’ responses for automobile design and provides automobile design that meet their emotional needs.}

abstract = {Background
Over the past 4 decades, obesity has escalated into a global epidemic, with its worldwide prevalence nearly tripling. Pharmacological treatments have evolved with the recent development of glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, such as semaglutide. However, off-label use of drugs such as Ozempic for cosmetic weight loss has surged in popularity, raising concerns about potential misuse and the emergence of substandard and falsified products in the unregulated supply chain.
Objective
This study aims to conduct a multifactor investigation of product quality and patient safety risks associated with the unregulated online sale of semaglutide by examining product availability and vendor characteristics and assessing product quality through test purchases.
Methods
We used a complex risk and quality assessment methodology combining online market surveillance, search engine results page analysis, website content assessment, domain traffic analytics, conducting targeted product test purchases, visual quality inspection of product packaging, microbiological sterility and endotoxin contamination evaluation, and quantitative sample analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
Results
We collected and evaluated 1080 links from search engine results pages and identified 317 (29.35%) links belonging to online pharmacies, of which 183 (57.7%) led to legal pharmacies and 134 (42.3%) directed users to 59 unique illegal online pharmacy websites. Web traffic data for the period between July and September 2023 revealed that the top 30 domains directly or indirectly affiliated with illegal online pharmacies accumulated over 4.7 million visits. Test purchases were completed from 6 illegal online pharmacies with the highest number of links offering semaglutide products for sale without prescription at the lowest price range. Three injection vial purchases were delivered; none of the 3 Ozempic prefilled injection pens were received due to nondelivery e-commerce scams. All purchased vials were considered probable substandard and falsified products, as visual inspection indicated noncompliance in more than half (59%-63%) of the evaluated criteria. The semaglutide content of samples substantially exceeded labeled amounts by 28.56%-38.69%, although no peptide-like impurities were identified. The lyophilized peptide samples were devoid of viable microorganisms at the time of testing; however, endotoxin was detected in all samples with levels ranging between 2.1645 EU/mg and 8.9511 EU/mg. Furthermore, the measured semaglutide purity was significantly low, ranging between 7.7% and 14.37% and deviating from the 99% claimed on product labels by manufacturers.
Conclusions
Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist drugs promoted for weight loss, similar to erectile dysfunction medications more than 2 decades ago, are becoming the new blockbuster lifestyle medications for the illegal online pharmacy market. Protecting the pharmaceutical supply chain from substandard and falsified weight loss products and raising awareness regarding online medication safety must be a public health priority for regulators and technology platforms alike.}

The rational design of allosteric effectors requires new state-of-the-art approaches to account for the distinct characteristics of allosteric ligands and their modes of action. We present a broadly applicable computational framework for obtaining allosteric site–effector pairs, providing targeted, highly specific, and tunable regulation to any functional site. We validated the framework using the main protease from SARS-CoV-2 and the K-RasG12D oncoprotein. High-throughput per-residue quantification of the energetics of allosteric signaling and effector binding revealed known drugs capable of inducing the required modulation upon binding. Starting from fragments of known well-characterized drugs, allosteric effectors and binding sites were designed and optimized simultaneously to achieve targeted and specific signaling to distinct functional sites, such as, for example, the switch regions of K-RasG12D. The generic framework proposed in this work will be instrumental in developing allosteric therapies aligned with a precision medicine approach.

Typically, ADS-equipped vehicles operate within certain boundaries specified by an operational design domain (ODD), utilizing the relevant implemented BCs. Nonetheless, many regulatory and standardization-relevant documents employ BC attributes in a non-harmonized manner. The study delves into BC-related activities and applications throughout the entire ADS life cycle, affecting all aspects of the ADS value chain, to gain a deeper understanding of the diverse needs of various stakeholders. BCs are linked to one of the four primary requirement sources at the system level. ADS-related BCs are defined through a multidisciplinary approach driven by their underlying core operating principle: the well-known sense-plan-act cycle. The crucial element within the BC specification is the identified manoeuvre pool, which forms the basis for implementing any route from point A to point B. The individual manoeuvres within the manoeuvre pool are defined by considering the needs of multiple stakeholders. They are based on three essential components: the initial condition, the expected manoeuvre, and the final condition. Furthermore, trustworthy behaviour competencies are specified, encompassing three pillars: robustness, ethics, and lawfulness. Following a detailed stakeholder analysis, several related applications are discussed to highlight the concrete advantages of implementing standardized BCs. The study concludes with a summary of the impact analysis, emphasizing key findings and action points. Lastly, a roadmap is proposed to integrate trustworthy BCs into future ADS. Concretely, the authors developed the following innovations within the scope of this article: (1) Concept for trustworthy behaviour competencies driven by law, ethics, and robustness. (2) Robustness is defined as passenger & ODD awareness and plannable & executable manoeuvre. (3) Manoeuvre pool necessary to implement an arbitrary route from point A to point B. (4) Manoeuvre specification via initial condition, expected behaviour, and final condition. (5) The potential benefits of harmonized behaviour competencies drive impact assessment.}

In the current study, 90 male Hu lambs were used to investigate the effect of dietary CNT intake on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, meat quality and oxidative stability, rumen microbial, and the transcriptomes of muscle and liver. A completely randomized design with three CNT intake levels (0, 0.3%, and 0.6%) was used. Rumen microbial and nutrient digestibility were not significantly altered by CNT intake. Diets with 0.3% CNT intake significantly reduced the shear force, yellowness at 24 h, and C20:2 polyunsaturated fatty acids of lamb meat and malondialdehyde in serum and longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle. Meanwhile, the 0.3% CNT diet significantly increased average daily gain during the 1– 21 days and 64– 90 days, dry matter intake during the 1– 21 days, the slaughter weight, and liver index of lambs. The 0.3% CNT diet significantly increased C26:0 saturated fatty acids, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in LT muscle. The meat shelf life of 0.3% CNT and 0.6% CNT groups was prolonged by 8.7 h and 5.4 h, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CNT supplementation can induce the expression of antioxidant enzyme gene (CAT, SOD1), and the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in antioxidant activity, transferase activity, and adenosine triphosphate binding. These results suggest that 0.3% CNT intake can relieve the oxidative stress of lambs, and improve the stability of meat color and meat tenderness, due to the enhanced antioxidative capacity.}

However, existing methods still face problems such as insufficient fusion of modal features, underutilization of crowd structure, and the neglect of scale information. In response to the above issues, this paper proposes a cross-modal multi-scale perception network (CMPNet). Specifically, CMPNet mainly consists of a cross-modal perception fusion module and a multi-scale feature aggregation module. The cross-modal perception fusion module effectively suppresses noise features while sharing features between different modalities, thereby significantly improving the robustness of the crowd counting process. The multi-scale feature aggregation module obtains rich crowd structure information through a spatial context aware graph convolution unit, and then integrates feature information from different scales to enhance the network’s perception ability of crowd density. To the best of our knowledge, CMPNet is the first attempt to model the crowd structure and mine its semantics in the field of cross-modal crowd counting. The experimental results show that CMPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on all RGB-T datasets, providing an effective solution for cross-modal crowd counting. We will release the code at https://github.com/KunChenKKK/CMPNet.}

We focus on the junctions between Σ3 {112} grain-boundary facets (often termed "incoherent" or "lateral" twin boundaries) in face-centered-cubic metals. Planar Σ3 {112} boundaries have long been modeled as dense arrays of Shockley partial dislocations distributed on adjacent {111} planes. Here, we analyze how such dislocations must be arranged at grain-boundary facet junctions. We find that these junctions constrain the sequences of dislocations that can allow for motion of the junctions through coordinated, conservative glide, a result we investigate with complementary molecular-dynamics simulations. For some facet arrangements, namely those for which facets are terminated at both ends by junctions of the same sense, the Shockley partial dislocations must change planes at the junctions, forming a2〈110〉 unit jogs. Because the unit jogs require the absorption or emission of point defects to move, they will limit motion of facet junctions. Such considerations offer insights into the mechanisms governing grain-boundary junction behavior.}

While much of the current research on GenAI in academia focuses on technical capabilities or ethical concerns, few studies have examined how GenAI can be leveraged to promote equity and inclusivity, particularly in academic communication. In this study, we adopt the theoretical lens of Ubuntu, a Southern African philosophy that emphasises interconnectedness and community, to reconceptualise GenAI as a democratising force. Five international PhD students in Education and their PhD supervisor (all multilingual users of English) explored their experiences of using GenAI. We used a collaborative autoethnographic approach, incorporating reflective prompting, individual writing, group sharing and refining, and group-based writing. We demonstrate that GenAI reshaped power dynamics and challenged academic hierarchies by providing real-time language support and improving academic writing clarity. This empowered us to participate in academic discourse, disrupting traditional gatekeeping mechanisms. By automating routine tasks, GenAI also shifted our academic focus from technical skills to intellectual contributions, fostering inclusivity and equity. This study highlights the potential of GenAI in terms of knowledge creation and academic discourse, particularly for doctoral scholars navigating linguistic and cultural barriers. Academia is predominantly Anglophone-centric, marginalising non-English-speaking scholars by imposing additional barriers to participation and recognition, perpetuating inequities in knowledge creation and dissemination. We argue that embracing GenAI can help to decolonise these academic practices, thereby promoting epistemic justice and creating a more equitable scholarly environment for all.}

To this end, process mining techniques use event data, typically extracted from information systems and organized along process instances. The inherent complexity of real-world processes has driven the recent introduction of object-centric process mining, allowing for a more comprehensive view of processes. Another avenue of research contributing to more complete process analyses is integrating unstructured data, which can enhance traditional event logs by extracting hitherto unidentified process information. Although combining the object-centric perspective with event log enrichment from unstructured data sources holds promising potential, such investigation remains in its infancy. Against this background, this study presents the OCRAUD, a reference architecture that provides guidance on using unstructured data sources and traditional event logs for object-centric process mining. A design science research process was employed to design and evaluate the OCRAUD. This involved conducting a total of 20 expert interviews over two rounds, comparing the OCRAUD to competing artifacts, instantiating the artifact for the use of video and sensor data, developing a software prototype, and applying the prototype to real-world data. This work contributes to process mining by guiding the combination of unstructured data with traditional event logs, incorporating an object-centric representation of event data. The instantiation targets video and sensor data, thereby demonstrating the use of the artifact. This enables researchers and practitioners to instantiate the artifact for other data types or specific use cases. The published code of the software prototype allows for further development of the implemented algorithms.}

This study employs social network analysis to investigate the dynamics of collaboration regarding open-source software development on GitHub. Specifically, the study focuses on collaboration among various economies as defined by the International Organization for Standardization in ISO 3166-1 (2020). Collaboration data, such as Git pulls and pushes from the GitHub Innovation Graph from 2020 to 2023, were adopted as primary sources. Around 190 eligible economies were included in the analysis based on their collaboration efforts. The study constructed a directed, weighted network to map these collaborations, identify key economies, and validate the small-world phenomenon discussed by Watts and Strogatz in 1998. Network centrality statistics were summarized, and network communities were identified. The small-world phenomenon was validated by benchmarking the small-worldness index proposed by Humphries and Gurney in 2008. Furthermore, this study shows that variations in developer counts, repository volumes, or organization presence do not significantly influence an economy’s centrality measures, such as closeness and eigenvector centralities.}

Commercial fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) tools has been increasingly deployed in U.S. commercial buildings. While they are helping to achieve energy efficiency and operational reliability, there remain gaps in their fault diagnostic capabilities. The diagnostic results often contain multiple distinct candidate root causes (CRCs) or offer no insight into CRCs. This study developed a novel active rule-based multi-mode data analysis method to enhance diagnostic resolution by applying proven rule sets and additional new rules to data from multiple known operational modes. The proposed method was demonstrated using enhanced air handling unit performance assessment rule sets and validated with the simulated data of two air handling units. New metrics, namely, reduced number of CRCs and improvement ratio, were developed to quantify the improvement of fault diagnostic resolution. The validation results showed that the proposed method effectively reduced the number of CRCs in contrast to analyzing data solely for a single mode of operation. It achieved a median improvement ratio of 80% in 19 test cases.}

Thus, the present work aimed to evaluate the features of green tea kombucha during fermentation, monitoring the changes in pH, acidity, turbidity, polyphenols, ethanol, acetic acid, volatile compounds, and sensory profile and acceptance up to 14 days of fermentation. Kombuchas’ pH and acidity decreased through time as expected, but after 4 days of fermentation, the beverage exceeded the Brazilian legal limits of acidity (130 mEq/L) and produced more than 0.5% AVB, which labels the beverage as alcoholic. Total polyphenols and condensed tannins content enhanced until the seventh day of fermentation and remained constant. Fermentation highly impacted the aroma of the infusion with a high formation of volatile acids, such as alcohols, esters, and ketones. Aldehydes were degraded during the bioprocess. Sensory characterization of kombucha showed that fermentation of 4 days increased perceived turbidity; vinegar, citric fruit, acid, and alcoholic aroma; and produced the beverage with sour, bitter, and vinegar flavor. Thus, the fermentation time of kombuchas must be controlled as they rapidly change and impact on the physicochemical parameters and sensory profile of the beverage can be negative.}

Sponge cities enhance a city’s capacity to absorb and retain rainwater, thereby reducing the frequency and severity of urban flooding. However, in recent years, extreme rainfall events have led to poor performance in terms of rainwater absorption, storage, and release, resulting in severe casualties and significant economic losses. This paper focuses on both the internal operation and external environment of sponge city drainage systems. Externally, the goal is to reduce surface runoff after heavy rainfall, while internally, the aim is to improve the drainage system's ability to prevent, withstand, and recover from exceptionally heavy rainstorms. A novel multidimensional flood resilience assessment method is proposed, leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology to evaluate the performance of sponge cities. Corresponding multidimensional flood resilience optimization strategies are introduced to enhance surface runoff management after rainfall and improve the sponge city performance in the prevention, resistance, and recovery stages. Finally, a software, Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), was used to simulate an area in of Zhengzhou City during the “720″ rainstorm, validating the feasibility of the proposed method.}

It goes further by extending – and in some respects updating – the model, taking into account forgotten technologies and introducing new waves of enabling technologies associated with Industry 4.0 and 5.0. The rise of the internet and digitization posed an existential threat to libraries. Their survival, however, is due to their ability to reinvent themselves – transforming this threat into an opportunity, and embracing innovative trajectories that aren't solely ICT-based.

abstract = {Objective:
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), which integrate multiple data modalities beyond text. Although MLLMs show promise, there is a gap in the literature that empirically demonstrates their impact in healthcare. This paper summarizes the applications of MLLMs in healthcare, highlighting their potential to transform health practices.
Methods:
A rapid literature review was conducted in August 2024 using World Health Organization (WHO) rapid-review methodology and PRISMA standards, with searches across four databases (Scopus, Medline, PubMed and ACM Digital Library) and top-tier conferences—including NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, MICCAI, CVPR, ACL and EMNLP. Articles on MLLMs healthcare applications were included for analysis based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results:
The search yielded 115 articles, 39 included in the final analysis. Of these, 77% appeared online (preprints and published) in 2024, reflecting the emergence of MLLMs. 80% of studies were from Asia and North America (mainly China and US), with Europe lagging. Studies split evenly between pre-built MLLMs evaluations (60% focused on GPT versions) and custom MLLMs/frameworks development with task-specific customizations. About 81% of studies examined MLLMs for diagnosis and reporting in radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology, with additional applications in education, surgery, and mental health. Prompting strategies, used in 80% of studies, improved performance in nearly half. However, evaluation practices were inconsistent with 67% reported accuracy. Error analysis was mostly anecdotal, with only 18% categorized failure types. Only 13% validated explainability through clinician feedback. Clinical deployment was demonstrated in just 3% of studies, and workflow integration, governance, and safety were rarely addressed.
Discussion and Conclusion:
MLLMs offer substantial potential for healthcare transformation through multimodal data integration. Yet, methodological inconsistencies, limited validation, and underdeveloped deployment strategies highlight the need for standardized evaluation metrics, structured error analysis, and human-centered design to support safe, scalable, and trustworthy clinical adoption.}

abstract = {Although the aquaculture industry has undergone monumental development worldwide, the ever-present threats of infectious diseases have become a constraining factor, imperiling its sustainability. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a real menace to industrial aquaculture due to the careless adoption of preventive therapies (antimicrobial therapeutic drugs) to forestall disease outbreaks in aquatic food production. Suitable strategies, or at least supplementary measures, should therefore be developed to curb the emergence and widespread transmission of AMR. Vaccination represents one of the primary options to substantially mitigate the economic damages imposed by emerging infectious diseases on global aquaculture; nevertheless, the availability of commercial aquatic vaccines is usually limited, and many vaccines only confer minimal or poor protection against infections (during the early stages of animal development). Accordingly, a large body of research has been enthusiastically exploring alternate approaches for managing animal health challenges. These efforts have led to the establishment of various biocontrol strategies, such as the versatile use of high-value functional ingredients (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, paraprobiotics, postbiotics, and phytogenics), phage therapy, and quorum-sensing interference (QSI), to promote the health and welfare of farmed aquatic species in a responsive or preventative manner. This review article addresses the state-of-the-art pertinent to biological control as an eco-friendly green approach for aquatic disease management, paving the route to a sustainable blue revolution. The potential biological mechanisms of these strategies are also described, along with the impediments to scientific progress and topics that merit further investigation.}

This study first explores an AGIME standardization process with the methodology of use case collection and iterative research. We then propose the definition and attributes of AGIME and establish a standard system framework for the AGIME life cycle. This framework includes published specifications such as information model, data specification, evaluation specification, and application requirements on teaching and learning. We introduce standard application cases to validate the effectiveness of AGIME standard system framework. Finally, we present several specifications currently under development within this standard system, including interface, regulatory, operation and maintenance, and security, ethics, and privacy specifications. This study provides references for AGIME development and deployment, ensuring the technical stability, data credibility, evaluation accuracy, and pedagogical applicability of AGIME.}

However, existing methods tend to overfit in data-scarce environments and lack generalizability across diverse cultural contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a Topic Prompts Multimodal Network (TPMN), a novel framework that integrates topic-guided prompt learning with a Wide & Deep architecture for robust depression prediction. Specifically, topic prompts — contextual cues derived from underlying topic patterns in patient interviews — are constructed using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based prompt collection, capturing personalized semantic topics to guide multimodal feature alignment. These prompts help the model prioritize clinically relevant interactions across modalities via a cross-attention coupling function, where complex transformations dynamically align multimodal features, effectively mitigating overfitting while enhancing interpretability. Extensive experiments on AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 demonstrate TPMN’s superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 53% reduction in MAE (2.86 vs. SOTA 6.08) and 58% lower RMSE (3.36 vs. SOTA 7.96) on average. Notably, experiments on our self-collected Chinese dataset show that TPMN outperforms existing baseline methods, demonstrating its potential as a scalable diagnostic tool for diverse populations. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation across cultural datasets demonstrates TPMN’s strong generalizability, with results comparable to baseline methods. Beyond its technical contributions, this work bridges the gap between data-driven AI and clinical needs, offering a principled approach to personalized and culturally adaptive mental health assessment.}

However, forecasting economic time series with steep upward trends presents challenges, often leading to poorly fitting predictions. This study addresses the issue by applying differentiation as a preprocessing step. Three real-world time series exhibiting this behavior were analyzed and forecasted using two neural network models—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)—with and without preprocessing. The differentiated series were further processed using techniques such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and trend-fluctuation decomposition via Moving Average of Wavelet Transform. The results demonstrate that differentiation significantly enhances forecasting accuracy across all tested models, reducing errors by up to 30 % compared to models without preprocessing. This approach effectively mitigates trend-related distortions, leading to more reliable predictions in complex economic time series.}

The PIM sets a footprint for how cognitive development unfolds in collaborative inquiry in online learning experiences. Ironically, content analysis is a resource-intensive endeavor in terms of time and expertise, making researchers look for ways to automate text classification through ensemble machine-learning algorithms. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) through OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models in the public API to automate the content analysis of students' text data based on PIM indicators and assess the reliability and efficiency of automated content analysis compared to human analysis. Using the seven steps of the Large Language Model Content Analysis (LACA) approach, we proposed an AI-adapted CP codebook leveraging prompt engineering techniques (i.e., role, chain-of-thought, one-shot, few-shot) for the automated content analysis of CP. We found that a fine-tuned model with a one-shot prompt achieved moderate interrater reliability with researchers. The models were more reliable when classifying students' discussion board text in the Integration phase of the PIM. A cost comparison showed an obvious cost advantage of LACA approaches in online learning research in terms of efficiency. Nevertheless, practitioners still need considerable data literacy skills to deploy LACA at a scale. We offer theoretical suggestions for simplifying the CP codebook and improving the IRR with LLM. Implications for practice are discussed, and future research that includes instructional advice is recommended.}

In educational settings it is important to understand students' perceptions of the acceptability of ChatGPT for various learning activities and to examine whether prior digital divide concerns pertain to this digital innovation, in order to provide guidance for users, inform policymakers and other stakeholders, and extend digital divide research. The purpose is to investigate the associations of socioeconomic status (SES, both family and student), gender, and race/ethnicity with students’ perceived acceptability of common ChatGPT activities as well as their opinion about how beneficial ChatGPT is for college education, and additionally, whether such relationships differ based on adoption experience. We analyzed survey data quantitatively in two phases (N = 360 and 1267), applying measurement reliability and validity, correlations, and structural equation modeling. The results indicate that students with higher family SES and lower individual SES, and females, tend to view the acceptability of ChatGPT uses more positively, although racial/ethnic minorities are more critical of displacement activities. ChatGPT adopters perceive two dimensions of ChatGPT activities (academic support and academic displacement) as more acceptable than do non-adopters, and they also perceive uses for academic support more positively than for displacement. Moreover, adoption is a significant moderator of some of these associations. At this early stage of ChatGPT diffusion, these digital divide influences on acceptability and general opinion are weak and variable.

There are different ways to react to an injustice: some may prefer to punish the perpetrator, and others to compensate the victim. Here, our focus is on the role played by attention to determine these choices, investigating the relationship between attentional mechanisms and punishment/compensation in five preregistered experiments (N = 1157). Two eye-tracking experiments showed that people who focus more on the offender's payoff are more likely to punish, and when an exogenous stimulation increases the focus on the offender's payoff, people spend more to punish. An offender bias was also found, meaning that people, overall, prefer to focus on the offender's, rather than the victim's, payoff, and punish more than compensate. This was confirmed in three behavioural experiments, where people were exposed to either the offender's or the victim's payoff: when given the choice, people prefer to reveal the offender's payoff, and then punish; however, when randomly exposed to the victim's payoff, the preference for punishment disappears. Affective empathy boosts this effect: higher empathy leads to more punishment (or compensation) when the offender's (or victim's) payoff is revealed. These findings suggest that, whilst people have an intrinsic motivation to search for information that matches their preference (i.e., the offender's payoff and punishment), when exposed to an alternative piece of information (i.e., the victim's payoff), they modify their behaviour. Implications for understanding information bubbles and ways to overcome them are discussed.}

abstract = {Building material reuse can reduce the environmental impact of construction yet its advanced digital support is still limited. Which digital tools could effectively support repair of highly irregular, salvaged materials? To probe this question, a framework featuring six advanced digital tools is proposed and verified through six design and prototyping experiments. The experiments demonstrate that a digital toolkit integrating photogrammetry, robot vision, machine learning, computer vision, computational design, and robotic 3D printing effectively supports repair and recovery of irregular reclaimed materials, enabling their robust digitization, damage detection, and feature-informed computational redesign and refabrication. These findings contribute to the advancement of digitally aided reuse practices in the construction sector, providing valuable insights into accommodating highly heterogeneous reclaimed materials by leveraging advanced automation and digitization. They provide the crucial and currently missing technological and methodological foundation needed to inform future research on industrial digital solutions for reuse.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence technologies are rapidly advancing. As part of this development, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used when humans interact with systems based on artificial intelligence (AI), posing both new opportunities and challenges. When interacting with LLM-based AI system in a goal-directed manner, prompt engineering has evolved as a skill of formulating precise and well-structured instructions to elicit desired responses or information from the LLM, optimizing the effectiveness of the interaction. However, research on the perspectives of non-experts using LLM-based AI systems through prompt engineering and on how AI literacy affects prompting behavior is lacking. This aspect is particularly important when considering the implications of LLMs in the context of higher education. In this present study, we address this issue, introduce a skill-based approach to prompt engineering, and explicitly consider the role of non-experts' AI literacy (students) in their prompt engineering skills. We also provide qualitative insights into students’ intuitive behaviors towards LLM-based AI systems. The results show that higher-quality prompt engineering skills predict the quality of LLM output, suggesting that prompt engineering is indeed a required skill for the goal-directed use of generative AI tools. In addition, the results show that certain aspects of AI literacy can play a role in higher quality prompt engineering and targeted adaptation of LLMs within education. We, therefore, argue for the integration of AI educational content into current curricula to enable a hybrid intelligent society in which students can effectively use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT.}

A total of 3357 subjects underwent screening in the SCOPE natural history study for geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, including CFI sequencing and serum FI measurement. Eleven CFI RV genotypes that were challenging to categorize as type I (low serum level) or type II (normal serum level, reduced enzymatic function) were characterized in the context of pure FI protein in C3b and C4b fluid phase cleavage assays and a novel bead-based functional assay (BBFA) of C3b cleavage. Four variants predicted or previously characterized as benign were analyzed by BBFA for comparison. In all, three variants (W51S, C67R, and I370T) resulted in low expression. Furthermore, four variants (P64L, R339Q, G527V, and P528T) were identified as being highly deleterious with IC50s for C3b breakdown >1 log increased versus the WT protein, while two variants (K476E and R474Q) were ∼1 log reduced in function. Meanwhile, six variants (P50A, T203I, K441R, E548Q, P553S, and S570T) had IC50s similar to WT. Odds ratios and BBFA IC50s were positively correlated (r = 0.76, p < 0.01), while odds ratios versus combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) scores were not (r = 0.43, p = 0.16). Overall, 15 CFI RVs were functionally characterized which may aid future patient stratification for complement-targeted therapies. Pure protein in vitro analysis remains the gold standard for determining the functional consequence of CFI RVs.}

To address this, the physiological, metabolomic, proteomic and gene expression impact of pollination methods (artificial versus open-field pollination) on the pericarp, placenta and seed tissue of Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa A. Chev. ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit at maturity harvest and during postharvest ripening following short and long cold storage was investigated. Artificial pollination enhanced fruit set and seed number, resulting in increased fruit size and weight at harvest compared to open-field pollination, supporting its role in improving kiwifruit yield. Metabolomic analysis revealed that carbon is primarily redirected from sugar synthesis toward organic acid production in artificially pollinated fruit. Tissue-specific proteomic analysis indicated that artificial pollination alters plant growth regulator dynamics and induce extensive stress-associated responses. Moreover, artificial pollination accelerated kiwifruit ripening as evidenced by increased ethylene production and faster fruit softening. These changes were accompanied by altered expression of genes and proteins involved in ethylene signaling and cell wall structure, potentially reducing postharvest longevity. Additionally, artificial pollination decreased key esters and increased aldehydes, thus altering aroma volatile profiles. It also reduced the levels of important polyphenols, particularly catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin B2, which aligned with observed changes in gene expression. These findings highlight a critical trade-off: while artificial pollination enhances yield, it also modulates physiological processes that may compromise postharvest fruit quality. Overall, this study provides new insights into how pollination influences kiwifruit maturity and ripening, supporting pollination-based strategies to enhance both fruit yield and quality.}

However, existing threat hunting systems based on provenance graphs face challenges of high false negatives (FNs), high false positives (FPs), and low efficiency when confronted with diverse attack tactics and voluminous audit logs. To address these issues, we propose a system called Actminer, which constructs query graphs from descriptive relationships in CTI reports for precise threat hunting (i.e., graph alignment) on provenance graphs. First, we present a heuristic search strategy based on equivalent semantic transfer to reduce FNs. Second, we establish a filtering mechanism based on causal relationships of attack behaviors to mitigate FPs. Finally, we design a tree structure to incrementally update the alignment results, significantly improving hunting efficiency. Evaluation on the DARPA Engagement dataset demonstrates that compared with the SOTA POIROT, Actminer reduces FPs by 39.1 %, eliminates all FNs, and effectively counters adversarial attacks.}

We provide insights on how sports digitalisation is currently understood in the IS literature when examined from a stakeholder perspective. Our analysis identifies the key stakeholders involved in sports, the competition stages (i.e., before, during, or after), the nature of digitalisation in sports, and the key outcomes on which the literature focuses (behavioural, cognitive, and performance-related). Our analysis also points out several gap areas in the extant literature: the lack of attention paid to non-competing stakeholders (e.g., managers, referees, spectators) and the behavioural impact of digitalisation on stakeholders during competitions; and the current focus on analysing the effect of a single digitalisation solution on a single stakeholder. Building on these findings, we propose three future directions to advance research on sports digitalisation. First, future research needs to examine the effect of digitalisation on an eco-system of sports stakeholders. Second, the use of naturalistic reality images as a data source would enhance research during competition. Last, future studies need to consider the blending of borrowed (behavioural and cognitive) theories and novel digitally-enhanced concepts to strengthen the theoretical foundations of sports digitalisation in Information Systems.}

The overuse of lawn grasses and cultivars in green spaces is one of the most important drivers. Scholars have asserted that spontaneous vegetation provides various ecological benefits and should be widely incorporated in planting design. Factors influencing spontaneous plant diversity have mainly been studied in specific habitats or at the city scale, and findings surrounding the attributes of urban parks that support the diversity of spontaneous plants are lacking. This study aimed to provide a perspective on conserving spontaneous plants through inferring the urban park attributes associated with plant diversity. Twenty-two urban park samples in Beijing were examined to identify the correlation between various park variables and spontaneous vegetation. This study recorded 199 spontaneous plant species, with large historic parks containing the most number of species. Park size was a remarkable predictive variable for the diversity of spontaneous plants. Species richness and diversity in large parks were significantly higher than in small parks; not only in total richness due to the species–area relationship but also in richness and diversity at the community level independent of plot number. Microhabitat heterogeneity and the percentage of green area had the strongest positive association with the richness of spontaneous plants. In contrast, the maintenance intensity, perimeter–area ratio, and fragmentation of green area, deciduous forest, and open lawn patches had negative associations with spontaneous plant richness. Redundancy analysis demonstrated that park area, maintenance intensity, microhabitat heterogeneity, and deciduous forest patches were the most remarkable variables predicting species composition. The correlations of variables related to water and open lawn patches with spontaneous plant diversity were more evident in summer. The predicted variables were also more significantly correlated with the diversity of exotic species in summer than in spring. Perennial herbs were more sensitive to the evaluated park attributes. This study elucidates how spontaneous plants are associated with the attributes of urban parks in Beijing, with critical implications for other large cities.}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian diffusion-based MSD generation framework, MSDGD. This framework includes embedding modules such as the Parents-Children Numerical encoding scheme (ParentChild), which encodes column pair interactions, the Random Column Rearrangement algorithm (RamCol), which uncovers hidden multi-column relationships, and a Spatial Dimensional Transformation strategy (DimTrans) for optimal multi-row feature extraction. Additionally, we develop a new UNet model (MSDUNet) and a column relationship predictive process to enhance MSDGD optimization. We perform three sub-experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MSDGD in generating MSD, and to assess the framework across five metrics, we use (1) a Simulation Table without Column Relationship, (2) a Simulation Table with Column Relationship, and even (3) a complex relationship table derived from real-world U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators datasets. This table contains more than 40 columns and 8x4 categories. The experimental results indicate that MSDGD has a high potential for improving medical service quality, achieving a 97.97% reduction in errors rate, thus promoting research by generating dependable and diversified generation of medical services data.}

Maximizing resource utilization and ensuring efficient stakeholder coordination within logistics operations pose significant challenges. Recently, Digital Twin (DT) technology has gained increasing interest for its potential to enhance asset and operations management in logistics. However, few studies offer a comprehensive view of DT applications across end-to-end global logistics services, particularly in relation to service innovations and the technological maturity of different service types. This paper conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to explore the state of the art in DT applications in logistics, offering an in-depth understanding of recent research foci, advancements, and opportunities for service innovation. Following the screening process, 70 papers were selected and analyzed. A three-axis framework is used to categorize key aspects of effective DT application, focusing on application areas, service types, and technological maturity as measured by the Technology Readiness Level (TRL). In logistics operations, DT has the potential to innovate or enhance eight key services: Monitoring, Evaluation, Prediction, Optimization, Control, System Management, System Integration, and Adaptation. DTs must be proficient in five core capabilities to deliver these eight services: integration, computation, simulation, interoperation, and evolution. In terms of DT technology maturity, most research focuses on early-stage development, emphasizing conceptual frameworks and exploring potential services. While many studies have tested proposed DT services in simulated environments, only a few have evaluated them in real-world operational settings. Finally, research avenues are explored, providing valuable insights for future investigations and continued development of DT applications in logistics and supply chain management.}

N, N-bis(carboxymethyl)-L-glutamic acid (GLDA) injection has been predicted to increase the permeability of CO2 injection-induced cloud-fracture networks (CFNs) and could serve as an additional stimulation method. Nevertheless, the influence of differential stress, flow geometry, and scale on the characteristics of permeability enhancement by GLDA injection is yet to be clarified. Accordingly, this study experimentally elucidated the permeability enhancement characteristics of injecting a chelating agent in fractured granite under differential stress conditions as an additional method for creating geothermal reservoirs using CO2 injection. GLDA injection experiments were conducted on fractured-granite samples under conventional- and true-triaxial stress states under varying differential stress and pH conditions. Regardless of the differential stress and pH conditions, rock deformation and acoustic emission (AE) were negligible during the chelating agent flow-through experiments on the fractured samples, whereas similar permeability enhancement factors were achieved within the same duration. Thus, stress did not affect the permeability enhancement by chelating agent injections. The permeability enhancement factors were inferred to be high near the injection borehole because of the high viscosity of the solution. Therefore, reservoir stimulation should be conducted using low-concentration chelating agent solutions at constant injection pressures. The study provides insights into the stimulation strategies for creating geothermal reservoirs using CO2 injection.}

abstract = {The pathophysiology of many ailments, including neurological, gastrointestinal, and metabolic problems, is well known to be influenced by intestinal dysbiosis. Clinical research has provided evidence suggesting a strong correlation between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC) development. The active reprogramming of metabolic pathways to boost glycolysis, fatty acid production, lipogenesis, and glutaminolysis constitutes a major metabolic shift in cancer development, including CRC. The complex combination of different factors leads to CRC, making it an environmental disease. These factors include food and lifestyle choices, genetics and family history, age, underlying intestinal diseases, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. One of the primary risk factors for carcinoma development is diet, which impacts an individual's gut microbiome. In addition to impacting CRC formation, the gut microbiome also has immunomodulatory effects, including various immunological interactions and the underlying mechanisms governing them. Microbial interactions in CRC have been extensively studied, yet numerous unresolved queries exist on how gut bacteria can influence treatment. It is possible to perform microbiome-driven immunotherapies focusing on probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics. However, large-scale treatment utilization in CRC patients is limited by several issues, including variations in the microbial makeup of each patient's gut and a lack of established methods. The study highlights the impact of several risk factors, including dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and different approaches to halting and treating CRC progression with a focus on diet changes and modulation of the gut flora. Given the foregoing, we propose that if research gaps are addressed and immunotherapy is paired with microbial interventions, microbiota-based therapeutics could potentially impede the growth of tumors and treat CRC.}

However, integration of this technology into work-related lifelong learning contexts has been relatively atheoretical and non-systematic. Building on interdisciplinary adult learning research and our findings from several studies on an online graduate degree program in a high demand STEM field, we propose a multilevel, person-centric framework of adult learning processes related to: (1) knowledge and skill acquisition, (2) the development and maintenance of motivation and wellbeing over time, and (3) transfer of learning to career-related goals. For each level of the framework, we discuss issues related to the measurement and evaluation of learning. We outline affordances (i.e., functional benefits) of technology (including artificial intelligence) for supporting career-related learning at each level, and present future directions related to major gaps in the field's understanding of these affordances. Throughout the final section, we illustrate the implications of our framework with examples of its use in a research institute focused on AI adult learning technologies. Finally, we present guiding questions for researchers and practitioners interested in technology-mediated career-related learning.}

abstract = {Semiconductor supply chain uncertainty is increasingly complicated due to shortening product life cycles, demand fluctuation and a series of collaborative decisions, yet little research focuses on risk assessment from operational planning level to supply chain planning level. Limitations of existing approaches can be traced in part to the lack of a framework within which the decisions involved in different levels can be integrated and aligned in light of supply chain dynamics. This study aims to develop a semantic web based risk assessment framework to integrate collaborative planning and enable the interpretability among real world and simulation modelling. This study starts by proposing a performance elevation metric from interpreting planning level for overall supply chain effectiveness. This study further constructs an ontology for planning and control decisions to support building the risk assessment simulation model to ensure information system interoperability and link domain knowledge for semiconductor supply chain network resilience. For validation, a simulation model is constructed for backend production from a leading semiconductor company in Germany. The contribution of the proposed semantic web-based framework provides the interoperability for supporting supply chain management and reduces the gaps between simulation modelling and physical setting to enhance overall supply chain effectiveness.}

Even in the biological domain, the arrival of microscopic and nanoscopic images and videos captured for biological investigations increases the need for space to store them. Hence, storing these data in a storage-efficient manner is a pressing need. In this work, we have introduced a compact image representation technique with an eye on preserving the shape that can shrink the memory requirement to store. The compact image representation is different from image compression since it does not include any encoding mechanism. Rather, the idea is that this mechanism stores the positions of key pixels, and when required, the original image can be regenerated. The genetic algorithm is used to select key pixels, while the Gaussian kernel performs the reconstruction task with the help of the positions of the selected key pixels. The model is tested on four different datasets. The proposed technique shrinks the memory requirement by 87% to 98% while evaluated using the bit reduction rate. However, the reconstructed images’ quality is a bit low when evaluated using metrics like structural similarity index (ranges between 0.81 to 0.94), or root means squared error (ranges between 0.06 to 0.08). To investigate the impact of quality reduction in reconstructed images in real-life applications, we performed image classification using reconstructed samples and found 0.13% to 2.30% classification accuracy reduction compared to when classification is done using original samples. The proposed model’s performance is comparable to state-of-the-art’s similar solutions.}

abstract = {Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services are reshaping digital credit access in India, yet their adoption remains limited due to complex and interrelated consumer barriers. While previous research has explored general fintech or digital payment adoption, there is a significant gap in understanding BNPL-specific barriers, particularly how these barriers influence one another within India’s distinct socio-economic and regulatory landscape. India’s rapid fintech growth, large unbanked population, evolving regulatory environment, and uneven levels of digital and financial literacy make it a unique and urgent case for such inquiry. Thus, this study aims to identify and rank the key barriers to BNPL adoption in the Indian context and analyze their causal interrelationships, and adopts a sequential mixed-methods design for the same. In the qualitative phase, a netnographic analysis of BNPL app reviews—supported by existing literature (specifically Innovation Resistance Theory) and expert insights—was used to identify barriers. In the quantitative phase, the ‘Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory’ (DEMATEL) method was employed to analyze seven identified barriers, categorize them into causal and effect groups, and assess their interdependencies. The findings reveal digital illiteracy as the most influential causal barrier, affecting others such as inertia, privacy concerns, hidden fees and high penalty fees, and negative credit profiles. Impulse buying and regulatory concerns also emerged as key causal factors. The study offers practical recommendations, such as financial education, responsible lending, and regulatory reform, and contributes to BNPL literature by applying a novel methodological lens to an underexplored market. These insights can guide stakeholders seeking to responsibly scale BNPL adoption in India.}

This paper presents a review of 10 ethical reasoning methods suitable for the ICT domain. We have employed a method engineering technique to author metamodels for the methods, which were subsequently subjected to validation by experts proficient in the respective methods. Following a situational method engineering approach, we have also characterised each ethical reasoning method and validated the characterisation with the experts. This has allowed us to develop a tool that helps select the method that is most suitable for a given ethical reasoning situation. Furthermore, we deliberate on the practical application of ethical reasoning methods within conceptual modelling contexts. We are confident that we have laid the groundwork for further research into ethical reasoning of ICT, with a specific emphasis on its role during conceptual modelling.}

abstract = {We explore the concept of correlative activation free energy (CAFE) for the analysis and interpretation of viscosity data of a collection of 847 inorganic oxide glass formers that exhibit various degrees of non-Arrhenius behavior. The CAFE model formalism is strictly based on transition state theory and accounts for the variation in the activation barrier height for the viscous dissipation due to the structural evolution the system undergoes upon traversing the glass transition regime. Thus, fitting parameters are meaningful in a statistical thermodynamic context. Compared to the VFT and MYEGA equations, fits using the CAFE model are more robust when extrapolating to infinite temperature because the latter encodes non-enthalpic contributions to the rate coefficient more realistically. The CAFE model-based analysis reveals a strong connection between melt fragility and the degree of change in the potential energy landscape with temperature. Accordingly, while the average ground-state potential energy of the glass forming liquid gradually increases with temperature, the energy of the activated state remains relatively invariant. Our analysis also allows one to estimate the number of atoms involved in the viscous relaxation process, which ranges from approximately 10 to 50 atoms for the oxide glass formers studied. We observe that thermally activated dynamic phenomena exhibited by glassy networks, such as the mixed alkali effect, persist into the supercooled liquid state.}

The main objective of this study is to lay the groundwork for a systematic approach to selecting social media influencers (SMI) for influencer marketing campaigns.
Design/methodology/approach
This study achieves its objective by presenting an innovative framework that combines the ordinal priority approach (OPA) with the Delphi method. This hybrid approach is applied to an academic event promotion case study. The original 22 selection criteria for SMIs were derived from the Delphi evaluation. These criteria were subsequently ranked using modified OPA to select influencers in a systematic and hierarchical fashion.
Findings
This research proves the effectiveness of the framework by applying it to a case study. Three top-level critical criteria, 13 intermediate-level criteria and six additional criteria are revealed by this hierarchical prioritization of SMI selection criteria. This methodical procedure allows for a more logical and educated decision-making process in selecting the best influencers for marketing campaigns. This research also proves the feasibility of the proposed model.
Practical implications
Better influencer marketing campaigns and marketing resource allocation are possible outcomes of the suggested framework, which marketers and businesses can use as a more organized and objective tool for selecting SMIs.

keywords = {natural language processing, International Classification of Diseases, deep learning, electronic medical record, Taiwan diagnosis related groups},
abstract = {Background
International Classification of Diseases codes are widely used to describe diagnosis information, but manual coding relies heavily on human interpretation, which can be expensive, time consuming, and prone to errors. With the transition from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), the coding process has become more complex, highlighting the need for automated approaches to enhance coding efficiency and accuracy. Inaccurate coding can result in substantial financial losses for hospitals, and a precise assessment of outcomes generated by a natural language processing (NLP)–driven autocoding system thus assumes a critical role in safeguarding the accuracy of the Taiwan diagnosis related groups (Tw-DRGs).
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of applying an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), autocoding system that can automatically determine diagnoses and codes based on free-text discharge summaries to facilitate the assessment of Tw-DRGs, specifically principal diagnosis and major diagnostic categories (MDCs).
Methods
By using the patient discharge summaries from Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital (KMUCHH) from April 2019 to December 2020 as a reference data set we developed artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted ICD-10-CM coding systems based on deep learning models. We constructed a web-based user interface for the AI-assisted coding system and deployed the system to the workflow of the certified coding specialists (CCSs) of KMUCHH. The data used for the assessment of Tw-DRGs were manually curated by a CCS with the principal diagnosis and MDC was determined from discharge summaries collected at KMUCHH from February 2023 to April 2023.
Results
Both the reference data set and real hospital data were used to assess performance in determining ICD-10-CM coding, principal diagnosis, and MDC for Tw-DRGs. Among all methods, the GPT-2 (OpenAI)-based model achieved the highest F1-score, 0.667 (F1-score 0.851 for the top 50 codes), on the KMUCHH test set and a slightly lower F1-score, 0.621, in real hospital data. Cohen κ evaluation for the agreement of MDC between the models and the CCS revealed that the overall average κ value for GPT-2 (κ=0.714) was approximately 12.2 percentage points higher than that of the hierarchy attention network (κ=0.592). GPT-2 demonstrated superior agreement with the CCS across 6 categories of MDC, with an average κ value of approximately 0.869 (SD 0.033), underscoring the effectiveness of the developed AI-assisted coding system in supporting the work of CCSs.
Conclusions
An NLP-driven AI-assisted coding system can assist CCSs in ICD-10-CM coding by offering coding references via a user interface, demonstrating the potential to reduce the manual workload and expedite Tw-DRG assessment. Consistency in performance affirmed the effectiveness of the system in supporting CCSs in ICD-10-CM coding and the judgment of Tw-DRGs.}

abstract = {Background:
Antibiotic resistance increasingly threatens the interconnected health of humans, animals, and the environment. While misuse of antibiotics is a known driver, environmental factors also play a critical role. A balanced One Health approach—including the environmental sector—is necessary to understand the emergence and spread of resistance.
Methods:
We systematically searched English-language literature (1990–2021) in MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science, plus grey literature. Titles, abstracts, and keywords were screened, followed by full-text reviews using a structured codebook and dual-reviewer assessments.
Results:
Of 13,667 records screened, 738 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies focused on freshwater and terrestrial environments, particularly associated with wastewater or manure sources. Evidence of research has predominantly focused on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp., with a concentration on ARGs conferring resistance to sulphonamides (sul1–3), tetracyclines (tet), and beta-lactams. Additionally, the People’s Republic of China has produced a third of the studies—twice that of the next country, the United States—and research was largely domestic, with closely linked author networks.
Conclusion:
Significant evidence gaps persist in understanding antibiotic resistance in non-built environments, particularly in marine, atmospheric, and non-agricultural settings. Stressors such as climate change and microplastics remain notably under-explored. There is also an urgent need for more research in low-income regions, which face higher risks of antibiotic resistance, to support the development of targeted, evidence-based interventions.}

While AI-driven solutions have been applied to generic supply chain optimization, they often fail in addressing the unique challenges of SMFs, where HVAC systems must maintain sub-0.1 °C temperature stability, account for 40–60 % of facility energy consumption, and comply with stringent cleanroom standards. This paper proposes an innovative framework that integrates graph-based large multimodal models (G-LMMs), enhanced by graph neural networks (GNNs), to optimize SMF HVAC supply chains across the Design, Construction, Installation, Maintenance, and Operation (DCIMO) phases. GNNs enable the capture and analysis of complex relationships within HVAC systems, facilitating real-time anomaly detection and optimized material flows. Unlike conventional AI models, G-LMMs combine GNNs with multimodal data processing to achieve three key advancements: (1) real-time anomaly detection, (2) automated compliance monitoring, and (3) circular economy integration through resource reuse. G-LMMs enhance supply chain visibility by harmonizing diverse data types while meeting SMFs' precision requirements. As the first framework to unify GNNs and multimodal AI for HVAC optimization, this approach represents a paradigm shift in sustainable semiconductor manufacturing, with broader implications for industries reliant on precision-controlled environments.}

In an exploratory approach, the authors conducted a structured literature review to extract candidate process digitalization project (PDP) success factors (SFs) from the literature on business process management (BPM), project management (PM) and digitalization. After that, the authors validated, refined and extended these intermediate results through interviews with 21 members of diverse PDP teams. Finally, the authors proposed the PDP success model by linking the candidate SFs with relevant success criteria.
Design/methodology/approach
Digitalization substantially impacts organizations, which increasingly use digital technologies (DTs) to improve and innovate their business processes. While there are methods and tools for identifying process digitalization ideas and related projects (PDPs), guidance on the successful implementation of PDPs is missing. Hence, the authors set out to explore PDP SFs.
Findings
The PDP success model covers 38 PDP success factor candidates, whereof 28 are already backed by the literature and ten have emerged during the interviews. Furthermore, the SFs are structured according to seven categories from the literature covering a broad range of sociotechnical topics (i.e. strategy, structure, culture, people, process, project and technology) as well as equipped with preliminary success rationales.
Originality/value
The work is the first to systematically explore PDP SFs. The PDP success model shows that PDPs require a unique set of SFs, which combine established and hitherto underrepresented knowledge. It extends the knowledge on BPM and serves as foundation for future (confirmatory) research on business process digitalization and the successful implementation of PDPs.}

We estimate the difference in the electricity demand functions of residential customers across peak, intermediate, and off-peak periods before and after TOU pricing. In addition, we assess the supply curve in the wholesale electricity market and calculate the changes in electricity purchase costs by integrating the supply curve over the range of consumption changes across the periods. This study simulates the effects of TOU pricing on producer surplus that would be obtained if all residential customers in South Korea switch from increasing block pricing to TOU pricing. Our results show that TOU pricing can be an effective measure for load transfer and simultaneously increase producer surplus. We find that although the revenue of electric utility generally decreases, the cost savings are greater and thus producer surplus increases. The results can be a valuable reference for the South Korean government regarding the nationwide expansion of TOU for residential electricity in the future.}

Combining photonic Doppler velocimetry (PDV) probes and ultra-high-speed cameras, it allows for measuring the radial expansion velocity of the ring and for recording the different stages of the ring deformation until necking and ultimate fragmentation. Four metallic materials with different physical and mechanical properties are tested under the same loading conditions leading to strain rates around 104 s−1. The materials exhibit different responses in terms of deformation history and fracture. A comparison is made on (i) the postmortem microstructure and ductility between low strain rate tension loaded specimens and high-strain rate expansion loaded rings and (ii) numbers of necks and fragments between experimental results and theoretical estimations.}

It is imperative to guarantee that selected suppliers adhere to sustainability and resilience requirements while supporting the company’s economic advancement. This study addresses this challenge through a novel approach that combines the Best–Worst Method (BWM) with the Fuzzy Technique Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS). Integrating these methodologies reduces the burden of pairwise comparisons, a common challenge in supplier selection using multi-criteria decision-making, thereby streamlining the evaluation process. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, we implemented our method on an actual case study of e-commerce and conducted a sensitivity analysis of the results. The findings suggest that the proposed method offers improved consistency in rankings across criteria compared to traditional BWM. It also makes a balance between simplicity and accuracy, ensuring that selected suppliers are equipped to handle disruptions and uncertainties. This aligns practical simplicity with theoretical rigor which makes the proposed method more accessible and manageable for practitioners in real-world settings.}

abstract = {Microstructure plays a critical role in determining the macroscopic properties of materials, with applications spanning alloy design, MEMS devices, and tissue engineering, among many others. Computational frameworks have been developed to capture the complex relationship between microstructure and material behavior. However, despite these advancements, the steep learning curve associated with domain-specific knowledge and complex algorithms restricts the broader application of these tools. To lower this barrier, we propose a framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to enable microstructure design using intuitive natural language commands. Our framework employs contextual data augmentation, driven by a pretrained LLM, to generate and expand a diverse dataset of microstructure descriptors. A retrained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model extracts relevant microstructure descriptors from user-provided natural language inputs, which are then used by the DDPM to generate microstructures with targeted mechanical properties and topological features. The NLP and DDPM components of the framework are modular, allowing for separate training and validation, which ensures flexibility in adapting the framework to different datasets and use cases. A surrogate model system is employed to rank and filter generated samples based on their alignment with target properties. This work introduces a comprehensive framework that bridges natural language processing and mechanics, addressing key challenges such as the lack of training data, syntax invariance in textual descriptors, and precision in text embeddings. Demonstrated on a database of nonlinear hyperelastic microstructures, this framework serves as a prototype for accessible inverse design of microstructures, starting from intuitive natural language commands.}

abstract = {Background
Temperament and character are useful in risk assessment and therapy of individuals in the anxiety-depression spectrum but understudied in South Korea.
Objective
The study aimed to identify the temperament and character features associated with anxiety and/or depression in individuals with clinical disorders and in the general population.
Methods
A representative sample of 1384 Korean adults over 18 years old (58 % female) were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Multivariate analyses, including structural equation modeling and complex systems analysis, evaluated how personality influenced risk and resilience for anxiety and/or depression.
Results
The three groups with anxiety and/or depression were strongly distinguished by temperament and character: (i) In AD (n = 58), Harm Avoidance and Reward Dependence were higher than in DD, and Self-directedness was higher than in AD+DD; (ii) In DD (n = 90), Persistence, Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness were higher than in AD+DD; and (iii) In AD+DD (n = 101), Harm Avoidance was highest and Persistence and Self-directedness were lowest (i.e., they were lowest in Resilience). Structural equation models confirmed these risk relations with strong character development reducing the adverse effects of emotional hyperreactivity from extreme temperaments.
Limitations
Self-reports were measured only at one point in time, requiring collateral experimental data to support causal interpretation.
Conclusions
Interactions of temperament and character are strongly predictive of risk and resilience to anxiety and/or depression by regulating both positive and negative affect. Character mediates the adverse effects of extreme temperaments on affect.}

Our preliminary study found that Kv10.2 was decreased in the hippocampus of valproic acid (VPA) - induced ASD rats. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear how KCNH5 regulates autism-like features, or becomes a new target for autism treatment. We employed KCNH5 knockout (KCNH5-/-) rats and VPA - induced ASD rats in this study. Then, we used behavioral assessments, combined with electrophysiological recordings and hippocampal brain slice, to elucidate the impact of KCNH5 deletion and environmental factors on neural development and function in rats. We found that KCNH5-/- rats showed early developmental delay, neuronal overdevelopment, and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, but did not exhibit autism-like behavior. KCNH5-/- rats exposed to VPA (KCNH5-/--VPA) exhibit even more severe autism-like behaviors and abnormal neuronal development. The absence of KCNH5 excessively enhances the activity of the Protein Kinase B (Akt)/Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the hippocampus of rats after exposure to VPA. Overall, our findings underscore the deficiency of KCNH5 increases the susceptibility to autism under environmental exposures, suggesting its potential utility as a target for screening and diagnosis in ASD.}

In this study, a new deep neural networks framework is developed to predict crop yields in Australia, considering the impact of climate change, fertilizer use, and crop area. It is implemented for oats, corn, rice, and wheat crops, and its forecasting performance is benchmarked against five statistical and machine learning methods. All the software codes for the implementation of the proposed framework are freely available. The proposed framework shows the highest forecasting performance for all the considered crop types. It provides 23%, 38%, 39%, and 40% lower average mean absolute error than the benchmark methods for oat, corn, rice, and wheat crops, respectively. The reductions in average root mean squared error are 19%, 25%, 37%, and 29% over the benchmark methods. Then, it is used to predict yields of the considered crops in Australia towards 2025 under six different climate change scenarios. It is observed that although climate change has some boosting impact on crop yield, it is not sustainable to meet the demand. However, it is possible to keep crop yields rising while mitigating climate change.}

The results show that: (1) DS-PCS generated synthetic point cloud scenes in diverse styles, colors, and types; (2) incorporating these synthetic point clouds into training datasets alongside real point clouds significantly improved semantic segmentation accuracy on the S3DIS dataset; and (3) using mixed point cloud datasets further enhanced segmentation accuracy while substantially reducing the time required for preparing training data.}

Accurate identification and prediction of the comorbidity risk in T2DM facilitates improved clinical diagnostic decisions and enhanced patient prognoses. Existing studies frequently utilize single-task learning (STL) models to assess individual disease risks in T2DM comorbidity, overlooking the intricate relationships between various diseases and thus failing to capture their inherent connections, which leads to inaccurate risk predictions. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multi-gate mixture-of-self-attention-based-experts (MMAE) model under the multi-task learning (MTL) scheme. The proposed MMAE model is based on the self-attention mechanism and incorporates a new comorbidity diffusion coefficient (CDC) index to characterize correlations between diseases. We conduct comparative experiments against eight baselines on a real-world dataset, and the results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed MMAE. Our ablation experiments also show that the incorporation of the CDC index helps accurately identify high-risk patients. Furthermore, the proposed MMAE model can provide clinical decision support for physicians in assisting them in making more effective comorbidity diagnoses. This study has significant implications for clinical decision support and improving patient prognostic outcomes.}

Plasma and tissue samples were analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC for B(a)P metabolites. In addition to these studies, DNA isolated from colon and liver tissues was analyzed for B(a)P-induced DNA adducts by the 32P-postlabeling method using a thin-layer chromatography system. Western diet consumption resulted in a marked increase in DME expression and B(a)P metabolite concentrations in rats that were administered 100 µg/kg B(a)P + WD (p < 0.05) compared to other treatment groups. Our findings demonstrate that WD accelerates the development of colon tumors induced by B(a)P through enhanced biotransformation, and the products of this process (metabolites) were found to bind with DNA and form B(a)P-DNA adducts, which may have given rise to colon polyps characterized by gain in tumor number, sizes, and dysplasia.}

This study explores students’ level of self-determination, learning engagement, and use of language technology toward English language learning with an analysis in different engineering disciplines and correlation between variables.

Results revealed that there is a positive relationship between self-determination and learning engagement, where students are determined and recognize the importance of English learning. Moreover, there is a significant relationship between learning engagement and language technology engagement, indicating that there is indeed a certain correlation between the degree of learning engagement and use of language technology in the learning process. However, there is no significant relationship between self-determination and language technology engagement, which suggests individuality and independence in language learning and indicates a need for additional support in technology integration.}

The method is applied to the Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, where we address three key questions: (1) What are the daily summer transpiration rates of Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and Creosote (Larrea tridentata) individuals, and how do these species contribute to footprint-scale evapotranspiration? (2) How can the plant-level measurements be integrated for terrain-wide transpiration estimates? (3) What is the contribution of transpiration to total evapotranspiration within the eddy covariance footprint? Data collected from June to October 2022, during the North American Monsoon season, include hourly evapotranspiration and precipitation rates from the Ameriflux eddy covariance system (US Jo-1 Bajada site) and sap flux rates from heat-balance sensors. We used plant biometric measurements and supervised classification of multispectral imagery to upscale from the patch to footprint-scale estimations. A proportional relationship between the plant’s horizontal projected area and the estimated number of water flow conduits was extended to the eddy covariance footprint via UAS data. Our results show that Mesquite’s average daily summer transpiration is 2.84 mm/d, while Creosote’s is 1.78 mm/d (a ratio of 1.6:1). The summer footprint integrated transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) was 0.50, decreasing to 0.44 during dry spells and increasing to 0.63 following significant precipitation. Further testing of this method is needed in different regions to validate its applicability. With appropriate adjustments, it could be relevant for other areas with similar ecological conditions.}

abstract = {Background
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to inventory all outcome measures that are affected by tapering in chronic noncancer pain and to investigate the effectiveness of tapering.
Methods
A literature search was conducted from inception to April 2024 in MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PsycINFO.
Results
The initial database search identified 3969 articles, which were screened by two independent reviewers. Studies evaluating pain medication tapering in adults with chronic noncancer pain were eligible for inclusion. In total, 57 and 34 articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Risk of bias assessment demonstrated poor, fair, and good quality in 30, 24, and three studies, respectively. Pain intensity was the most reported outcome measure, as reported in 28 studies. Furthermore, a random-effect three-level meta-analysis was performed. An overall effect size of 0.917 (95% confidence interval 0.61–1.22; P<0.001) was found, indicating a beneficial effect of tapering. In addition, a statistically significant improvement was demonstrated after tapering for pain intensity, headache disability, the number of headache days per month, anxiety, depression, the number of pills consumed per month, the number of days with medication intake per month, pain catastrophising, and pain interference. No statistically significant effect was observed for physical functioning, mental health-related quality of life, opioid use, pain self-efficacy, and physical health-related quality of life.
Conclusions
This systematic review revealed a broad range of outcome measures affected by tapering. Owing to the high risk of bias of the included articles, the results of this meta-analysis must be interpreted with caution.

Focusing specifically on L3 students, this study explored the associations between perseverance of effort (PE), subjective well-being (SWB), harmonious passion (HP), and creativity. Furthermore, the study investigated the possible mediating roles of SWB and HP in the relationship between PE and creativity. Participants were 430 Chinese college students who attended an obligatory L3 course. To analyze the data, the PROCESS macro for SPSS was used to perform a mediation analysis, and the results showed that (1) PE, SWB, and HP all positively related to creativity, (2) PE directly predicted creativity, (3) SWB and HP could serve as partial mediators in the relationship between PE and creativity, and (4) the direct impact of personal trait (i.e., PE) on creativity is smaller than the indirect impact of positive emotions (i.e., SWB and HP). These findings highlight the significance of PE, SWB, and HP in facilitating creativity among L3 students. Based on these findings, instructive suggestions for fostering creativity in L3 students are discussed.}

abstract = {In the context of an increasingly automated and personalized manufacturing mode, efficient assembly sequence planning (ASP) has emerged as a critical factor for enhancing production efficiency, ensuring product quality, and satisfying diverse market demands. To address this need, our study first transforms the assembly topology and process into a weighted precedence graph, wherein parts represent nodes, and the assembly interconnections between parts constitute weighted edges. Then, we formulate the quantitative models of semantic knowledge, encompassing three facets: assembly direction changes, assembly stability, and part assembly interference, and thus constructs a heuristic function. We propose a novel dynamic graph learning algorithm, i.e., assembly-oriented graph attention sequence (A-GASeq), utilizing the heuristic information as edge weights of the assembly graph structure to incrementally direct the search towards optimal sequences. The performance of A-GASeq is first evaluated utilizing three key metrics: area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUC), precision score, and time consumption. The results reveal the superiority of our model over competing state-of-the-art graph learning models using a real-world dataset. Concurrently, we apply the algorithm to actual industrial products of diverse complexity, thereby demonstrating its broad utility across different complex products and its potential for addressing complex assembly sequence planning problems in the field of smart manufacturing.}

abstract = {With the development of intelligent manufacturing, robots are being increasingly applied in manufacturing systems due to their high flexibility. To avoid production disruptions caused by robot failures, higher requirements are imposed on the resilience of systems, specifically in terms of resistance, response, and recovery capabilities. In response to this, this paper investigates the resilient scheduling framework for multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop, thereby endowing and enhancing the resilience of the system. Within the resilient scheduling framework, a proactive scheduling method maximizing resistance capability is firstly proposed based on an improved NSGA-III with variable neighborhood search. Secondly, to improve the response and recovery capabilities of the system, a recovery scheduling method is presented. Therein, an adaptive trigger policy based on deep reinforcement learning is introduced to enhance the rapid response capability for disturbances, while the recovery optimization grants the system the ability to recover its performance that has been degraded due to the impact of disturbances. Finally, through simulation experiments and case study, it is verified that the proposed algorithms and framework possess superior performance of multi-objective optimization, which can endow the multi-robot multi-station welding flow shop with resilience to against uncertain robot failures.}

Sentiment analysis and stance detection are interrelated problems of affective computing, and their outputs commonly complement each other. The focus of this article is to determine sentiments and stances of Twitter users about vaccination. A tweet dataset on COVID-19 vaccination is compiled and jointly annotated with sentiment and stance. This deep learning approach employs BERT, which is a model based on pre-trained transformers. The generative deep learning model, ChatGPT, is also used for stance and sentiment analysis on the dataset. ChatGPT achieves the best performance for stance detection, while BERT is the best performer for sentiment analysis. This study is the first one to observe stance and sentiment detection performance of ChatGPT on health-related tweets. This article also includes a full-fledged system proposal based on automatic sentiment and stance analysis. COVID-19 pandemic is an impactful global public health phenomenon, and hence, joint extraction of sentiments and stances from health-related tweets can profoundly contribute to health-related decision-making processes.}

abstract = {As advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned technologies continues to progress, the development of unmanned system of systems (USS) has reached unprecedented levels. While prior research has predominantly examined temporal variations in USS resilience, spatial changes remain underexplored. However, USS may involve kinetic engagements and frequent spatial changes during mission execution, affecting signal interference in data layer communications. Although time-dependent factors primarily govern mission effectiveness of the USS, spatial factors influence the transmission stability of the data layer. Consequently, assessing spatiotemporal variations in USS performance is critical. To address these challenges, this study introduces a spatiotemporal resilience assessment framework, which evaluates USS resilience across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we propose a spatiotemporal resilience optimization scheme that enhances system adaptability throughout the mission lifecycle, with a particular emphasis on prevention and recovery strategies. Finally, we validate the validity of the proposed concepts and methods with a case study featuring a regular hexagonal deployment of USS. The results show that the spatiotemporal resilience can better reflect the spatial change characteristics of USS, and the proposed optimization strategy improves the prevention spatiotemporal resilience, recovery spatiotemporal resilience and entire-process spatiotemporal resilience of USS by 0.22%, 7.8% and 11.3%, respectively.}
