abstract = {Purpose
To investigate the incidence, timing, dimensional features, and spatial characteristics of telangiectatic capillaries (TelCaps) in retinal vein occlusion (RVO) patients treated with anti-VEGF monotherapy.
Design
Prospective nonconcurrent cohort study.
Participants
One hundred thirty-eight eyes of 138 patients with treatment-naive RVO treated with anti-VEGF monotherapy for a minimum of 24 months.
Methods
Telangiectatic capillaries were identified using multimodal imaging, including indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), OCT, and color fundus photography. Recurrence of venous occlusive events was defined by new onset of retinal hemorrhages accompanied by worsening of macular edema. Cox regression modeling was used to assess risk factors for TelCap development.
Main Outcome Measures
Telangiectatic capillaries' incidence, dimensional features, spatial distribution, and association with RVO recurrence events.
Results
Over 4.4 ± 2.6 years of follow-up, TelCaps developed in 15/138 eyes (10.9%) after 26 ± 16 months. Telangiectatic capillaries in hemispheric and central RVO showed larger diameters compared with branch RVO (277 ± 44 μm vs. 196 ± 43 μm, P = 0.005) and preferential localization along the temporal horizontal raphe (y-axis coordinates: 0.4 ± 0.6 mm vs. 0.9 ± 0.7 mm, P = 0.017). The recurrence of RVO during follow-up was significantly associated with TelCap development (hazard ratio = 8.74, 95% confidence limit = 2.92–26.2, P < 0.001). At 5-year follow-up, the risk of developing TelCaps was ∼9% in patients without recurrence and ∼55% in those patients with recurrence.
Conclusions
Telangiectatic capillaries occur in approximately 10% of RVO cases undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF monotherapy, with distinct characteristics based on RVO subtype. The strong association with disease recurrence suggests episodes of increased venous obstruction contribute to TelCap formation. Extended follow-up and vigilant screening are recommended; when TelCaps are suspected, ICGA can confirm the diagnosis and guide adjunctive targeted treatment.

This study assessed municipal wastewater systems across all 645 municipalities in the state of São Paulo using the most up-to-date data available (from the Sewage Atlas, 2015–2016). Daily potential nutrient loads were estimated at 327.48 t (N) and 40.93 t (P). The 768 Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) mainly served small municipalities (≤50,000 inhabitants) in isolated, centralized systems. Stabilization ponds were common in municipalities with populations up to 100,000 inhabitants, while aerobic reactors and activated sludge systems dominated in larger municipalities. Most WWTPs operated below 80 % capacity utilization, with many medium/large plants below 70 %. Secondary treatment was most common, with average expected nutrient removal efficiencies of 56.5 % for N and 37.3 % for P. Due to low efficiencies and limited coverage (64.8 %), modest reductions in residual loads were observed (36.9 % for N and 25.2 % for P). Despite the statistically significant difference between potential and residual loads, substantial discharges into receiving water bodies (206.53 t N and 30.60 t P daily) persist, leading to frequent exceedances of regulatory standards. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive strategies to expand wastewater treatment coverage and efficiency, and mitigate pollution from untreated and non-point sources.}

Equally GenAI poses challenges, including risks such as plagiarism and superficial engagement with content. Science teacher education programs play a key role in the way these opportunities are realized and how challenges are dealt with through educating the future generation of science teachers. Science teacher educators face the challenge to remodel their teaching program to showcase how GenAI is used appropriately. Their student teachers face the challenge of working with GenAI in their own learning, but also in their classroom teaching where their students in secondary education might be using GenAI. This interview study explored how science teacher educators and student-science teachers in the teacher training programs of the four technical universities in The Netherlands envisage the potential impact of GenAI on university science teacher education. Few of the teacher educators had actually used GenAI, compared to the number of student teachers that had used GenAI. Potential uses for GenAI in science teacher education and for science teaching in general were identified, as well as desired new learning goals. A strong need for a policy on the use of GenAI was expressed, including a need for clear guidelines and rules. The conclusion presents possible design characteristics for science teacher education to benefit from the advent of GenAI and circumvent associated risks.}

abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) frequently coexist, worsening outcomes. Catheter ablation (CA) is an established therapy, but the optimal timing remains unclear.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of early vs delayed CA on clinical outcomes in patients with AF and HF.
Methods
This International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews–registered systematic review (CRD42025643686) adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Comparative studies enrolling adults with AF and HF were included. Early CA was defined as ablation performed within varying timeframes (often ≤12 months) after AF diagnosis or HF decompensation vs delayed CA beyond that period. Primary outcomes were AF recurrence, all-cause mortality, and HF hospitalizations. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed.
Results
Ten studies (n = 15,822) contributed to the meta-analyses. Early CA was associated with significantly reduced AF recurrence (k = 8, hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52–0.78, P < .0001) and HF hospitalization (k = 5, HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.77, P < .0001). A nonsignificant trend toward reduced all-cause mortality was observed (k = 4, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.41–1.24, P = .23). Statistical heterogeneity was absent for HF hospitalization (I2 = 0%), moderate for AF recurrence (I2 = 67.6%), and high for mortality (I2 = 75.3%). Narrative synthesis included 2 additional randomized controlled trials comparing treatment strategies.
Conclusion
Evidence from pooled observational studies suggests early CA is associated with reduced AF recurrence and HF hospitalization in patients with AF and HF; a mortality benefit was not statistically confirmed. Interpretation warrants caution owing to reliance on observational data and methodological heterogeneity across studies.}

abstract = {During the last decade, nanomaterials and supramolecular assemblies have received considerable attention in different fields of sensing applications. The interest of supramolecular assemblies arises from the exceptional performances of nanostructured films based on such assemblies, which are related to both their well-controlled structure and their large surface area. These characteristics increase the number of active sites and facilitate the charge transport pathways. In addition, supramolecular assemblies can be used to prepare multicomponent sensing layers formed by materials with complementary activity. Finally, supramolecular films are highly efficient platforms for enzyme immobilization leading to highly sensitive biosensing. This paper describes the main concepts and approaches related to the development of supramolecular sensing layers in electrochemical sensors and biosensors. Different techniques commonly employed to develop supramolecular sensing layers, such as Self-assembling, Layer-by-layer and Langmuir-Blodgett, are described and their role as electron mediators in biosensors is revised using milk as an example of the target analyte. Using this approach, enzymes are immobilized in a biomimetic environment, giving rise to efficient biosensors able to detect glucose, galactose or lactose in milk with high degree of selectivity and low limits of detection. We also include a brief discussion of the possibilities of the integration of supramolecular assemblies into sensor arrays as the core of electronic and bioelectronic tongues. The advantages of these systems are related to their fast responses and their capability to detect many components in a single measurement. The expected limitations mainly related to the fouling of the electrodes, are also discussed.}

keywords = {Radial head fractures, Radial neck fractures, Fractures classification, X-rays classification, CT scan classification, Treatment algorithm},
abstract = {Background
Owing to the great variety of fracture patterns and limitations of the standard radiographic investigation, all the already available classification systems for radial head and neck fractures (RHNFs) are limited by a poor-to-moderate degree of intraobserver and interobserver reliability. Although computed tomography (CT) is being increasingly used to better understand the fracture characteristics, a CT-based classification system of RHNFs is still lacking. Therefore, in this agreement study, we aimed to propose a classification system based on two-dimensional and three-dimensional (2D/3D) CT to test the hypothesis that this classification has good intraobserver and interobserver reliability. We have also provided a treatment algorithm.
Methods
Our proposed classification—Proximal and Articular Radial fractures Management (PARMa)—is based on 2D/3D CT imaging. It is divided into four types based on different fractures patterns. The 2D/3D scans of 90 RHNFs were evaluated in a blinded fashion by eight orthopedic and one radiology consultant, according to the proposed classification. The first phase of observation aimed to estimate the interobserver agreement. The second phase involved a new observation, 4 weeks after the first analysis, and estimated the intraobserver reliability. The standard radiographs of these 90 fractures were also evaluated by the same observers, with the same timing and methods, based on the same classification. Cohen's Kappa was applied for intraobserver agreement. Fleiss's Kappa was used both within and among the evaluators. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was employed to determine the strength of association among the appraisers’ rankings. Furthermore, Krippendorff's alpha was chosen as an adjunctive analysis to assess between evaluators’ agreement.
Results
For the intraobserver agreement, Fleiss’ Kappa statistics confirmed the consistency (overall kappa values: 0.70-0.82). Cohen’s Kappa statistics aligned with Fleiss’ Kappa, with similar kappa values and significant P values (P < .001). For interobserver agreement, Fleiss’ Kappa statistics for between appraisers showed moderate-to-substantial agreement, with kappa values ranging from 0.54 to 0.82 for different responses. The results relating to the appraisers' observation of standard radiographs showed that the overall Fleiss’ Kappa values for intraobserver agreement ranged from 0.34 to 0.82, whereas Fleiss’ Kappa statistics for interobserver agreement ranged from 0.40 to 0.69.
Conclusions
The proposed classification system is expected to be reliable, reproducible, and useful for preoperative planning and surgical management. Both 2D and 3D CT allow the identification of the magnitude and position of displacement and articular surface involvement.}

Effective regulation can mitigate some of these risks, promote fairness, establish standards, and advocate for more sustainable AI practices. Regulating AI tools not only ensures their safe and effective adoption but also fosters public trust. It is important that regulations remain flexible to accommodate rapid advances in this field to support innovation and also not to add additional burden to some of our preexisting and well-established frameworks.

abstract = {Background
Musculoskeletal pain is a prevalent concern among diverse populations, from the average individual to the elite athlete. Handheld percussive massage therapy devices like massage guns have gained much popularity in both medical and athletic settings. Its application has been prominently recognized in injury prevention and rehabilitation. The expansion of the market to provide handheld percussive therapy devices with varying features and price points has encouraged professional and novice use. While percussive therapy holds similarities to more studied therapeutic modalities, like vibration therapy and soft tissue mobilization, there is limited evidence-based information on the indications and contraindications.
Objective
This study aims to use a qualitative analysis of consumer perceptions to understand the perceived therapeutic potential of percussive massage therapy as a home-based intervention for musculoskeletal concerns of everyday users and elite athletes. Additionally, we aim to gain insight on valuable characteristics supporting its therapeutic potential as well as pertinent limitations.
Methods
The TOLOCO massage gun (TOLOCO) was identified as the best-selling percussive massage therapy device on Amazon. We performed an inductive thematic qualitative analysis on the top 100 positive comments and the top 100 critical comments of the device between June 2020 and April 2023 to determine 4 relevant themes.
Results
The 4 themes identified upon qualitative analysis were pain management, versatility, accessibility, and safety and user education. Consumer reviews indicated use for this percussive therapy device in adolescents, adults, and older people across a spectrum of activity levels. Consumers reported the therapeutic potential of percussive massage therapy in managing wide-ranging musculoskeletal concerns like acute pain, chronic pain, nonsurgical injury rehabilitation, postsurgical injury rehabilitation, and injury prevention. Consumers highlighted the versatility of the device to address person-specific needs as a key feature in supporting its perceived therapeutic benefits. Additionally, consumers frequently commented on the affordability and availability of this device to increase accessibility to home-based care. Some critical reviews emphasized a concern for the quality of the device itself. However, this concern did not translate to the overall modality of percussive massage therapy. Of note, despite strong approval for its therapeutic potential, consumer reviews lacked evidence-based insights on appropriate usage.
Conclusions
Home-based percussive massage therapy holds value with its perceived efficacy in pain management for acute and chronic conditions, as well as in injury prevention and rehabilitation. As a low-cost and readily available device for everyday users and high-performing athletes, percussive massage therapy works toward establishing increased health care accessibility and optimizing health care usage. This home-based intervention can serve to reduce the significant personal and economic burden of prevalent musculoskeletal concerns. However, the limited scientific research on percussive massage therapy raises concerns about the lack of evidence-based care and indicates the need for future studies.}

To investigate the relationship between short-term changes in quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMGS) after thymectomy and postoperative recurrence in myasthenia gravis (MG) patients without thymoma.
Methods
A retrospective observational cohort study. The QMGS of 44 patients with non-thymomatous MG were evaluated before and 1 month after thymectomy, and the frequency and time of postoperative recurrence were recorded. The reduction rate of QMGS (rr-QMGS) was defined as (QMGS one week before thymectomy − QMGS one month after thymectomy)/ QMGS one week before thymectomy × 100 %, as an indicator of short-term symptom change after thymectomy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to determine an appropriate cut-off value of rr-QMGS for distinguishing postoperative recurrence. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to predict postoperative recurrence.
Results
Postoperative recurrence occurred in 21 patients (30 times in total) during follow-up. The mean annual recurrence rate was 3.98 times/year preoperatively and 0.30 times/year postoperatively. ROC analysis determined the cut-off value of rr-QMGS was 36.7 % (sensitivity 90.5 %, specificity 52.2 %). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that rr-QMGS＜36.7 % (hazard rate[HR]6.251, P = 0.014) is positive predictor of postoperative recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that postoperative recurrence time was earlier in the low rr-QMGS group than in the high rr-QMGS group (12.62 vs. 36.60 months, p = 0.005).
Conclusions
Low rr-QMGS is associated with early postoperative recurrence. Rr-QMGS can be used to predict postoperative recurrence of non-thymomatous MG.}

abstract = {Background
Today, most smartphones provide a digital voice assistant (DVA) for their user, and it is estimated that about 91% of adults report owning and operating a smartphone. A DVA is an automated system preinstalled on technological devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets, and speakers, which serves to aid users in performing tasks like answering questions, managing smart devices at home, playing music, managing schedules, sending messages, and more. Research with DVA is emerging, and its applicability to health and health care needs to be elucidated.
Objective
The objective of this study was to describe the use of DVAs among primary care patients, as well as purposely sampled clinics including patients with visual and physical disabilities.
Methods
A convenience sample of adult participants was recruited to complete a needs assessment survey to ascertain the interest and possible utility of DVAs to promote and enhance health from among three populations at an academic medical center: (1) general primary care patients recruited from a primary care clinic, (2) patients with visual disabilities recruited from a low vision clinic, and (3) patients with physical disabilities recruited from a physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic. The survey used in this study was a 46-item investigator-developed instrument administered to participants assessing knowledge, use, and perceptions of DVAs, participant interest to participate in related future studies, and demographics.
Results
The results of the survey showed that the majority of participants have used a DVA before (69.7%, 152/218) and were or might be willing to use them in the future (84.0%, 178/212). Participants reported moderate to high concern about the privacy (47.8%, 97/203), security (54.5%, 110/202), and confidentiality (51.7%, 105/203) of DVAs. A greater proportion of those with visual disabilities reported having never used DVA than those without visual disabilities (39.0% vs 24.6%, P=.03). There was no significant difference in reliance on DVAs for participants with and those without physical disabilities (45.0% vs 34.9%, P=.31), indicating that they do not require it for everyday needs.
Conclusions
DVA use remains low among the surveyed participants with physical and visual disabilities. For those with visual disabilities, DVA use was seen to be advantageous in everyday life for tasks such as answering questions and seeking information, but not for those with physical disabilities. However, further research should be conducted that focuses on the use of DVAs by accessing data that represent an individual’s DVA use without being biased by knowledge of a research study. In addition, research is needed on DVA use that includes diverse samples of participants with physical and visual disabilities, which address the barriers to using DVAs for these adult populations.}

We developed a wholly online short course open to interdisciplinary professionals working in digital health in the health care sector. In a flipped classroom model, participants (n=400) undertook 2 hours of preclass learning online and then attended 2.5 hours of live synchronous learning in interactive weekly Zoom workshops for 13 weeks. Throughout the course, they collaborated in small, simulated learning communities (n=5 to 8), engaging in various activities and problem-solving exercises, contributing their unique perspectives and diverse expertise. The course covered a number of topics including background on LHS, establishing learning communities, the design thinking process, data preparation and machine learning analysis, process modeling, clinical decision support, remote patient monitoring, evaluation, implementation, and digital transformation. To evaluate the purpose of the program, we undertook a mixed methods evaluation consisting of pre- and postsurveys rating scales for usefulness, engagement, value, and applicability for various aspects of the course. Participants also completed identical measures of self-efficacy before and after (n=200), with scales mapped to specific skills and tasks that should have been achievable following each of the topics covered. Further, they undertook voluntary weekly surveys to provide feedback on which aspects to continue and recommendations for improvements, via free-text responses.
Results
From the evaluation, it was evident that participants found the teaching model engaging, useful, valuable, and applicable to their work. In the self-efficacy component, we observed a significant increase (P<.001) in perceived confidence for all topics, when comparing pre- and postcourse ratings. Overall, it was evident that the program gave participants a framework to organize their knowledge and a common understanding and shared language to converse with other disciplines, changed the way they perceived their role and the possibilities of data and technologies, and provided a toolkit through the LHS framework that they could apply in their workplaces.
Conclusions
We present a program to educate the health workforce on integrating the LHS model into standard practice. Interprofessional collaborative learning was a major component of the value of the program. This evaluation shed light on the multifaceted challenges and expectations of individuals embarking on a digital health program. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of the audience is crucial for creating an inclusive and supportive learning environment. Addressing these challenges will not only enhance participant engagement but also contribute to the overall success of the program and, by extension, the broader integration of digital health solutions into health care practice and, ultimately, patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Glioblastoma is one of the most common and aggressive primary brain tumours in adults. Though radiation therapy (RT) techniques have progressed significantly in recent decades, patient survival has seen little improvement. However, an area of promise is the use of fluorine-18-fluoroethyltyrosine positron-emission-tomography (18F-FET PET) imaging to assist in RT target delineation. This retrospective study aims to assess the impact of 18F-FET PET scan timing on the resultant RT target volumes and subsequent RT plans in post-operative glioblastoma patients.
Materials and Methods
The imaging and RT treatment data of eight patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and treated at a single institution were analysed. Before starting RT, each patient had two 18F-FET-PET scans acquired within seven days of each other. The information from these 18F-FET-PET scans aided in the creation of two novel target volume sets. The new volumes and plans were compared with each other and the originals.
Results
The median clinical target volume (CTV) 1 was statistically smaller than CTV 2. The median Dice score for the CTV1/CTV2 was 0.98 and, of the voxels that differ (median 6.5 cc), 99.7% were covered with a 5 mm expansion. Overall organs at risk (OAR) and target dosimetry were similar in the PTV1 and PTV2 plans.
Conclusion
Provided the 18F-FET PET scan is acquired within two weeks of the RT planning and a comprehensive approach is taken to CTV delineation, the timing of scan acquisition has minimal impact on the resulting RT plan.}

Attackers try to mislead their victims when assessing whether emails are dangerous to interact with, e.g., by using techniques based on dangerous links, dangerous attachments, or both. In this work, we present a systematic literature research of deception techniques discussed in the scientific literature of the last decade. We systematize the deception techniques, focusing on techniques that use misleading sender, link, and/or attachment information. We identify 23 deception techniques which we classify as either those that email clients should protect users against (13) and those that email clients cannot protect against and thus should be addressed in security awareness measures (10). We propose a security rating for the susceptibility of email clients to these 13 deception techniques and perform an empirical evaluation to analyze the susceptibility of seven representative email clients (web, mobile apps, desktop apps) to these deception techniques. The results of our evaluation indicate that most email clients are in need of improvement to defend against the deception techniques. Hardening email clients against these deception techniques is necessary to increase the resistance against them — without unnecessarily burdening users.}

abstract = {Background
Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and influence cancer development and progression. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered form of cell death, plays an important role in cancer. Nonetheless, additional research investigating the association between cuproptosis-related lncRNAs and prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis is required.
Methods
Sequencing data and copy number variant data were obtained from 492 patients with PCa from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program. Prognostic models of PCa based on cuproptosis-related lncRNAs were constructed using a multi-level attention graph neural network (MLA-GNN) deep learning algorithm. Immune escape scoring was performed using Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion. Cellular experiments were conducted to explore the correlation between key lncRNAs and cuproptosis.
Results
Data from 492 patients with PCa were randomized into two groups at a 1:1 ratio. Prognostic modeling was successfully established using MLA-GNN. Survival analysis suggested that patients could be divided into high- and low-risk groups according to model scores and that there was a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) (P < 0.01). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) indicated a strong predictive performance for the model, with AUCs of 0.913, 0.847, and 0.863 for the training group and 0.815, 0.907, and 0.866 for the test group at 12, 36, and 60 months, respectively. The immune escape score and immune microenvironment analysis suggested that the high-risk group corresponded to a stronger immune escape and a poorer immune microenvironment (P < 0.05). Cellular experiments revealed that the expression of all six key lncRNAs was upregulated in the presence of copper ion carriers (P < 0.05).
Conclusions
This study identified cuproptosis-related lncRNAs that were strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Key lncRNAs could affect copper metabolism and may serve as new therapeutic targets.}

abstract = {Purpose
Fibronectin adhesion assay progenitors (FAA-CPs) and migratory assay progenitors (MCPs), subsets of mesenchymal-like stromal cells (MSCs), exhibit superior in-vitro chondrogenic potential compared to bone marrow (BM)-MSCs and chondrocytes. To assess this potential, differentiation studies followed by confirmatory staining for collagen deposition are utilized. Polarized light microscopy (PLM), based on birefringence principles, is a valuable tool for visualizing organized collagen fibers. Its use as a predictive tool for assessing chondrogenesis and osteogenesis has not been reported.
Methods
This study involved FAA-CPs, MCPs, chondrocytes, and BM-MSCs derived from osteoarthritic knee joints (n = 3). After phenotypic characterization, the cells underwent chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation, followed by Picrosirius red staining and PLM analysis, including immunohistochemical analysis for collagen types I, II, and X.
Results
Birefringence assessment revealed greater collagen fibril alignment and significant remodeling in the BM-MSC group, which exhibited an arcade-like pattern. The MCP group displayed well-organized collagen fibrils in pericellular zones and as a peripheral band, while chondrocytes and FAA-CPs exhibited lower intensity birefringence, indicating random alignment. Areas with higher collagen type II deposition corresponded to reduced collagen type I and the absence of collagen type X, highlighting the unique fibrillar network seen with PLM was indicative of collagen type II.
Conclusion
While its application for osteogenesis was limited, probably due to the non-fibrillar nature of collagen type X, its value for chondrogenesis is notable. Although not directly reflecting chondrogenesis, PLM can serve as a valuable tool for gaining insights into collagen remodeling, particularly concerning collagen type II during chondrogenic differentiation.}

abstract = {Background and aim
Generative AI (GenAI) can transform nursing education and modernise content delivery. However, the rapid integration of these tools has raised concerns about academic integrity and teaching quality. Previous reviews have either looked broadly at artificial intelligence or focused narrowly on single tools like ChatGPT. This scoping review uses a structured framework to identify patterns, advances, gaps, evidence, and recommendations for implementing GenAI in nursing education.
Methods
This scoping review followed the JBI methodology and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ERIC, and grey literature (October to November 2024). Data synthesis utilised the PAGER framework as a mapping tool to organise and describe patterns, advances, gaps, evidence for practice, and recommendations.
Results
Analysis of 107 studies revealed GenAI implementation across four key domains: assessment and evaluation, clinical simulation, educational content development, and faculty/student support. Three distinct implementation patterns emerged: restrictive, integrative, and hybrid approaches, with hybrid models demonstrating superior adoption outcomes. Technical advances showed significant improvement from GPT-3.5 (75.3 % accuracy) to GPT-4 (88.67 % accuracy) in NCLEX-style assessments, with enhanced capabilities in multilingual assessment, clinical scenario generation, and adaptive content creation. Major gaps included limited methodological rigour (29.0 % of empirical studies), inconsistent quality control, verification challenges, equity concerns, and inadequate faculty training. Geographic distribution showed North American (42.1 %) and Asian (29.9 %) dominance, with ChatGPT representing 83.2 % of tool implementations. Key recommendations include developing institutional policies, establishing quality verification protocols, enhancing faculty training programs, and addressing digital equity concerns to optimise GenAI integration in nursing education.
Conclusions
GenAI has transformative potential in nursing education. To realise its full potential and ensure responsible use, research should focus on developing standardised governance frameworks, empirically validating outcomes, developing faculty in AI literacy, and improving technical infrastructure for low-income contexts. Such efforts should involve international collaboration, highlighting the importance of the audience's role in the global healthcare community.}

In this paper, we propose a new DPM-based generative medical image segmentation method, named EIDiffuSeg. Specifically, we first construct an explicit-implicit aggregation priori knowledge with directional supervision ability by mining the semantic distribution pattern in the frequency and spatial domains. Then, the explicit-implicit aggregation priori knowledge is integrated into the different encoding stages of the denoising backbone network using a novel unsupervised priori knowledge induction strategy, which can guide the model to generate a segmentation mask of the region of interest directionally from a random inference process. We evaluate our method on three medical image segmentation benchmark datasets with different modalities and achieve the best segmentation results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Especially, compared to several current diffusion-based image segmentation methods, we achieved a 9% Dice improvement in the polyp segmentation benchmark. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Notmezhan/EIDiffuSeg.}

A new generative art evaluation model based on this hybrid algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show that the improved whale algorithm outperforms comparative algorithms, reaching optimal values after 190 iterations in uni-modal and 210 iterations in multi-modal functions. The model also performs well in fitness tests and evaluates AI-generated Paper Cuttings with a mean square error of 0.0101 and a fitting coefficient of 0.987.

Differential privacy offers a practical, general, and quantifiable framework for worst-case privacy protection, which is critical when handling sensitive patient data. By utilizing differential privacy in federated learning workflows, strong privacy guarantees can be achieved with often minimal compromises in the utility of shared insights or model performance.

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) detection using deep learning techniques plays a crucial role in the pre-harvest estimation of yuzu (Citrus Junos) yield. However, the detection performance of deep learning models heavily depends on the quantity and quality of training data. One of the current challenges is that the work of labeling data is difficult and expensive, because of the high density of fruits, the similarity in color between fruits and leaves, and the varying lighting conditions in the captured images of fruit trees. To address these challenges, we propose to use generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data generation, and then utilize the generated data to improve the yuzu detection performance of YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 models. In this study, the experimental images were photographed using UAVs from two orchards of Kochi agricultural research center between 2020 and 2022. In our approach, we first trained a conditional GAN called Pix2Pix using pairs of images, where the training inputs are the images of fruit trees with all fruits removed, and the training targets are the original images. Subsequently, we created new regions of interest on the images of fruit trees and used the trained Pix2Pix network to generate yuzu fruits within these regions, thereby generating new labeled images. In the experiments, we merged real and generated images to train YOLO v8-series models and explored to reduce the dependency on real training images through the proposed data augmentation approach. The results showed that the combined training of these generated and real images can significantly improve the detection performance of YOLO v8-series models, with the maximum improvements of 5.4% in F1-scores, 5.6% in mAP50, and 7.1% in mAP50–90, respectively. Moreover, the proposed data augmentation approach allowed for up to a 50% reduction in the amount of real training images while still achieving improved detection results.}

Materials do not have a genome, yet for the past decade, and into the next decade, in the USA, there has been a presidential and inter-agency funding initiative called the “Materials Genome Initiative (MGI).” This initiative has nothing to do with real genomes, materials, or otherwise. However, in this paper, we, somewhat whimsically, explore some ideas about what a material’s gene could be and how it could be used to further our understanding of materials structure and properties. The result is a slightly non-conventional, less crystal-centric, view of materials structure that we believe can, will, and is resulting in novel materials insights.}

abstract = {Plant growth in space goes beyond nutrition, it enhances well-being by connecting humans to nature through biophilic design. Nutrient stress is a major constrain in Space. This study used barley as a model plant in non-circulating hydroponics with varying nitrogen levels to simulate space nutrient stress conditions and test nano-fertiliser technology. Nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots were applied in solution (hydroponics) and sprayed (aeroponics) to alleviate stress and keep the plant attractive under Space stress. The leaves' greenness was assessed using the soil plant analysis development (SPAD) during plant growth. The study found that plants grown under ‘high nitrogen’ (1 mM) conditions had higher SPAD and shoots-to-roots ratio (S/R) could reach as high as 31, and 3.2, respectively. In contrast, ‘low nitrogen’ grown plants were less green and bushy, wherein the SPAD and S/R were 11.2 and 1.03, respectively. The foliar fertilisation (FF) treatment turned out to be effective for the biophilic parameters, provided it started early, i.e. after one-week of plant growth. Applying an FF after two weeks was found to be less effective because the fresh S/R increased from 1.93 to 2.94. The FF treatment slightly increased the SPAD for the ‘low nitrogen’ sample by comparison to the control sample (no FF). Regardless of the treatment, the fresh shoot weight decreased under ‘low nitrogen’, except when being boosted by a high concentration (100 mg/l) of the nano-fertiliser quantum dots. Nonetheless, the fresh shoot weight of ‘low nitrogen’ growth was almost identical to ‘high nitrogen’ growth, which were 1.88 g and 2.20 g, respectively. These findings epitomise the potential of the nano fertiliser to reduce nitrogen use in plants. The results from the best experimental data gathered (greenness, shoots/roots, leaf number/shape) were implemented in a visualisation of an early-stage idea for the Spaceship interior using an artificial intelligence (AI) SDXL 1.0 model. Plant growth experiments in a home-built spacecraft replica confirmed that the use of LN (0.5 mM) conditions can be favourably used under ‘real-space conditions’ and that the nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dot nanofertiliser is effective for creating biophilic SPAD value.}

abstract = {Introduction
While there is no consensus on the best surgical procedure for post-burn axillary contractures, it is crucial to consider the elongation rate along the scar axis as a useful measurement index for determining the optimal surgical approach. The square flap and five flap z-plasty techniques are commonly employed scar lengthening procedures to address scar contractures in the axilla. These approaches successfully disrupt the linear scar, leading to significant elongation while reducing transverse tension. Our study aims to compare the increase in band length and functional results of these two approaches for treating post-burn contractures in the axilla.
Methods
A retrospective study was carried out utilizing data from 34 patients with mild-to-moderate band-like contractures located on the anterior or posterior axillary lines who underwent surgical correction through either the square flap method or five-flap z-plasty technique. The effectiveness of surgical methods was evaluated using two objective indices: improvement in contracture band length and improvement in abduction angle at the shoulder joint.
Results
All patients achieved complete contracture release. There is no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the improvement in the degree of abduction postoperatively. Although there was a significant increase in the length of the contracture band postoperatively in both groups, the average increase in length for cases treated with a square flap was significantly greater than those managed with a five-flap Z-plasty (87.7 ± 44.8 % vs. 38.80 ± 11.119 %,) respectively.
Conclusion
The square flap technique is considered a better alternative to the commonly used 5-flap Z-plasty method because it can achieve higher elongation in the contracture band, restore joint function, and create optimal shape when dealing with single linear band contractures over the axilla.}

We aimed to investigate the involvement of interhemispheric cortical dynamics as measured by combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) in recovery of upper limb (UL) motor functions in chronic stroke patients.
Methods
Ten patients with a history of single ischemic chronic stroke were enrolled (4F, 63.8 ± 9.9 years). Each patient underwent TMS-EEG recordings to evaluate interhemispheric cortical dynamics as well as a reaching task recorded with inertial measurement units, and a series of clinical assessments. TMS-EEG neurophysiological data were analysed considering spatiotemporal, power response, and interhemispheric balance (IHB) dynamics.
Results
We found that IHB index (IHBi) and low-frequency power (LFP) (4–13 Hz) in the affected hemisphere were associated with the degree of UL impairment.
Conclusion
Increased IHBi due to stroke is an unfavourable factor of UL’ functions. Similarly, LFP of both hemispheres is strongly correlated with clinical and kinematic outcomes.
Significance
TMS-EEG biomarkers of interhemispheric unbalance could be used to estimate functional recovery and drive tailored neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation approaches.}

abstract = {Objective
This ex vivo study investigated the effects of pre-treatment either with or without a deproteinization procedure using a sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution on percentage resin infiltration in natural non-cavitated proximal subsurface carious lesions of (pre)molars. Moreover, we studied whether a correlation exists between lesion size and infiltration area.
Methods
Extracted human premolars and permanent molars (n = 40 each) with macroscopically non-cavitated proximal subsurface carious lesions (ICDAS code 2/radiographic E2 and D1 lesions) were randomly divided into two groups. In Group 1 (control), the carious lesions underwent a standard resin infiltration protocol (deploying 15 % hydrochloric acid, 99 % ethanol, and Icon Caries Infiltrant). With the specimens of Group 2, a deproteinization step using 1 % NaOCl was applied prior to the standard infiltration procedure. Teeth were sectioned mesio-distally (perpendicular to their occlusal tooth surface and through the proximal lesion) and polished to the deepest lesion extension (as defined by DIAGNOdent). Total lesion sizes and infiltration areas were analyzed via confocal laser scanning micrographs. Paired data were submitted to linear regression analysis employing SPSS (v29.0).
Results
With the deproteinized specimens (Group 2), a significantly higher percentage of resin infiltration (p = .003) was observed, along with a strong positive correlation between lesion size and infiltrated area (r = .97; p < .001), if compared to Group 1 (r = .89; p < .001).
Conclusions
Deproteinization with NaOCl prior to resin infiltration significantly enhances the infiltrant’s penetration ability into non-cavitated carious lesions, resulting in a strong relationship between lesion size and infiltrated area.
Clinical significance
Deproteinization by means of NaOCl solution should be implemented as an integral step and key component to the standard infiltration protocol to significantly improve the resin infiltrant’s penetration ability into initial subsurface lesions.}

Such a framing orients us to doings, to practices, to enactments, and consequential outcomes. These considerations of AI-in-the-making are inspired by agential realism, a theory that calls attention to performativity and accountability. Based on these ideas, we propose a sociomaterial genealogical approach that we suggest is well-suited for the study of AI-in-the-making. In so doing, we provide qualitative scholars with a way of orienting their inquiries toward the performativity of ongoing AI reconfigurations and sociomaterial accountabilities.}

Although it is known, that silver interacts and binds on complex organic substances like proteins, many experiments on the sterilisation efficiency and inhibiting properties are still carried out in complex culture media. Given, that silver is often applied in environments with no or few organic substrates, like cooling circuits or in the treatment of tap and process water, further insight on the minimum inhibition concentration and lethal concentration at those conditions is of interest. We have developed a defined medium for the standard bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that is free of complex organic carbon with equal cultivation properties like commonly used nutrient solutions. With this medium we could narrow the range of the MIC between 2.5 μg to 10 μg∙L−1, which very much overlaps with the bactericidic concentration depending on the initial concentration of bacteria cells. These results might help to optimise the technical application of silver. We further observed a delayed growth of bacterial cultures of up to three days compared to silver free controls, which is caused either by a partial sterilisation down to theoretical one surviving cell or by a prolonged lag phase. Based on these observations we recommend a prolonged incubation for experiments on sterilisation with silver and the use of defined media, which do not interact with the disinfecting agent.}

Professional training methods are available but are often prohibitively expensive, limiting opportunities primarily to privileged individuals. To bridge this accessibility gap and democratize access to job opportunities, there is a need to develop automated interview simulation platforms. The advent of Generative AI (GenAI) technology, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), makes this is viable proposition but progress is hindered by the absence of open-source implementations for reproducibility and comparison, as well as the lack of suitable evaluation benchmarks and experimental setups. In particular, we do not yet know how robust such systems are and if they will be bias-free, factors that will contribute to their acceptability and use. To this end, we propose Interview Training and Education Module (ITEM), a job interview training module that combines Virtual Reality-based metaverse technology with LLM-based GenAI models. Our module creates realistic interview experiences for skill enhancement, complete with personalized feedback and improvement guidelines based on user responses. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of the module to ascertain its robustness, including a bias analysis. Firstly, we establish an experimental setup to gauge platform robustness by examining question similarity across varied prompts using Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and topic modeling. Subsequently, we explore biases in three categories—country of origin, religion, and gender—by analyzing ITEM's evaluation scores while manipulating candidate backgrounds, all while keeping their responses unchanged. Our findings indicate potential biases replicated by ITEM, highlighting the need for caution in its application for personal development and training. This pioneering initiative introduces the first open-source module for job interview training within a virtual metaverse, leveraging LLM-based Generative AI, designed for extension and testing by the scientific community, thereby enhancing insights into the limitations and ethical considerations of AI-driven interview simulation platforms.}

A GF formulation composed of maize starch and six structurally different non-gluten proteins was tested. Rheological and pasting properties, bread volume and starch digestibility were evaluated to study the significance of these interactions. Batter analyses indicated that protein functionality, particularly free sulfhydryl groups and surface hydrophobicity, strongly influenced pasting. Critical strain (0.09–0.14%) and flow transition points (1.01–3.69%) varied with protein type, showing distinct microstructural variations within the batter. Non-covalent interactions, especially hydrophobic and electrostatic forces, played a major role in stabilizing the OH bread, while conventional baking probably relied more on covalent interactions. Hydrogen bonding between polymers contributed to an increase in resistant starch (RS). This study revealed that specific non-covalent interactions played a crucial role in the structural and nutritional properties of GF bread, particularly when applying OH.}

The long-term effectiveness of vortioxetine for facilitating progress toward personal recovery goals and improving productivity at work was assessed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods
Single-arm, prospective, 24-week cohort study in employed patients with MDD initiating treatment with vortioxetine (n = 121) in outpatient settings in Japan. The Goal Attainment Scale for Depression (GAS-D) was used to evaluate progress toward personal recovery goals. At baseline, a combination of patient-defined and pre-specified goals was established collaboratively with the treating psychiatrist, followed by longitudinal assessments at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24. Work-related productivity was assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. Co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients achieving their pre-specified personal recovery goals at week 12 and the change in work productivity from baseline.
Results
In all, 45/107 patients (42.1%) had achieved their personal recovery goals at week 12, increasing to 62/100 (62.0%) at week 24. Significant improvement was observed across all WPAI domains (i.e., absenteeism, presenteeism, productivity loss, and activity impairment) at week 24. Depressive symptoms, global patient functioning, emotional and cognitive symptoms, cognitive performance, and quality of life also significantly improved over the 24 weeks of follow-up. At week 24, 80/102 patients (78.4%) remained on vortioxetine; 49 of these patients (61.3%) were receiving vortioxetine 20 mg/day.
Limitations
Open-label study.
Conclusions
Vortioxetine was found to be effective in helping to achieve personal recovery goals and in enhancing workplace productivity over the 6-month study period in patients with MDD.

abstract = {Background
Symptom-checkers have become important tools for self-triage, assisting patients to determine the urgency of medical care. To be safe and effective, these tools must be validated, particularly to avoid potentially hazardous undertriage without leading to inefficient overtriage. Only limited safety data from studies including small sample sizes have been available so far.
Objective
The objective of our study was to prospectively investigate the safety of patients’ self-triage in a large patient sample. We used SMASS (Swiss Medical Assessment System; in4medicine, Inc) pathfinder, a symptom-checker based on a computerized transparent neural network.
Methods
We recruited 2543 patients into this single-center, prospective clinical trial conducted at the cantonal hospital of Baden, Switzerland. Patients with an Emergency Severity Index of 1-2 were treated by the team of the emergency department, while those with an index of 3-5 were seen at the walk-in clinic by general physicians. We compared the triage recommendation obtained by the patients’ self-triage with the assessment of clinical urgency made by 3 successive interdisciplinary panels of physicians (panels A, B, and C). Using the Clopper-Pearson CI, we assumed that to confirm the symptom-checkers’ safety, the upper confidence bound for the probability of a potentially hazardous undertriage should lie below 1%. A potentially hazardous undertriage was defined as a triage in which either all (consensus criterion) or the majority (majority criterion) of the experts of the last panel (panel C) rated the triage of the symptom-checker to be “rather likely” or “likely” life-threatening or harmful.
Results
Of the 2543 patients, 1227 (48.25%) were female and 1316 (51.75%) male. None of the patients reached the prespecified consensus criterion for a potentially hazardous undertriage. This resulted in an upper 95% confidence bound of 0.1184%. Further, 4 cases met the majority criterion. This resulted in an upper 95% confidence bound for the probability of a potentially hazardous undertriage of 0.3616%. The 2-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson CI for the probability of overtriage (n=450 cases,17.69%) was 16.23% to 19.24%, which is considerably lower than the figures reported in the literature.
Conclusions
The symptom-checker proved to be a safe triage tool, avoiding potentially hazardous undertriage in a real-life clinical setting of emergency consultations at a walk-in clinic or emergency department without causing undesirable overtriage. Our data suggest the symptom-checker may be safely used in clinical routine.

abstract = {Numerous age-related degenerative diseases have been linked to diminished intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH), a vital antioxidant in the human body. Unfortunately, exogenous GSH encounters various barriers that prevent its entry into most human cells. γ-Glutamylcysteine (γ-EC), an immediate precursor of GSH, is a potential therapeutic agent that restores cellular GSH levels. Additionally, both compounds can serve as kokumi taste substances and enhance basic taste sensations. Considering the growing interest among health-conscious consumers toward naturally derived diets, the incorporation of fresh fruits and vegetables abundant in GSH and γ-EC presents a promising alternative for supplementation. Screening of various plant samples, including fruits, vegetables, and mushrooms, revealed that ripe durian pulp exhibited the highest levels of GSH (∼2.6) and γ-EC (∼14) per milligram per gram of dry weight. Owing to the popularity of durian-related products, we extended our investigation to analyze GSH and γ-EC contents in processed products. Notably, durian chips and pastes displayed a significant decrease in GSH and γ-EC levels, suggesting their sensitivity to heat. This observation was further validated by the observed instability of GSH and γ-EC standards during heat treatment. Our findings underscore the potential of durian fruit as a rich dietary source of GSH and γ-EC.}

Adopting a cross-national perspective, this study examines how disease-related factors—namely, disease threat and stigma—influence both individuals' intentions to seek health information via generative AI and their preferences for AI compared to traditional interpersonal sources like doctors and peers. In a preregistered 2x2 online experiment, participants from Austria, Denmark, France, and Serbia (Ntotal = 1951) encountered written scenarios about their health that manipulated disease threat (low vs. high) and stigma (low vs. high). The sample was stratified to ensure representativeness for age, gender, and educational level across the countries studied. Results showed no main effect of disease threat on AI information-seeking intentions, but stigma significantly influenced preferences, particularly in mild health conditions. Participants were more likely to consult AI over peers for stigmatized conditions, highlighting the role of AI's anonymous interface in reducing social judgment. Country differences further revealed that national contexts also shape AI adoption: while participants in Denmark and France showed a stronger preference for AI over peers, those in Serbia and Austria preferred peers over AI. Additionally, AI trust and literacy emerged as the strongest predictors of both AI usage intentions and preferences. These findings indicate that gen AI tools can play a complementary role in the health information ecosystem, particularly for stigmatized conditions and in contexts where traditional sources are perceived as less accessible or judgment-free.}

abstract = {Background
The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the etiology of autism and its sex-biased prevalence remain largely elusive. We have previously shown that children with non-syndromic low-functioning idiopathic autism exhibit a sexually dimorphic pattern of relative telomere length (RTL), with autistic male children having significantly shorter RTL than autistic female children, healthy controls, and paired siblings. By contrast, a number of autistic girls had longer RTLs than healthy controls. Here, we investigated levels of telomeric oxidized base (TelOB) lesions among the same study subjects and groups.
Methods
Employing a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based method, which combines DNA digestion targeting oxidized bases and telomere measurement, TelOB lesions were measured using genomic DNA extracted from saliva samples collected from 24 children (14 male and 10 female) with autism, 10 paired siblings, and 24 sex, age, and location-matched typically-developing controls.
Results
Our findings show that both male and female autistic children exhibit substantially higher TelOB lesions at their telomeres than healthy controls and paired siblings. Interestingly, these elevated levels of TelOBs show a direct correlation with RTL values in autistic children but not in healthy controls. However, TelOB levels do not show any association with age either in the autistic children or the healthy control group.
Conclusions
Our findings open a fresh angle into autism spectrum disorders (ASD), raise new questions, and lay the foundation for further research into telomere biology and underlying molecular mechanisms involved in ASD. TelOB levels are likely set during early development and may serve as biomarkers for childhood autism.}

abstract = {Background
The use of mobile technologies to deliver behavioral health interventions, including smoking cessation support, has grown. Users’ perceptions are important determinants of the adoption and use of new technologies. However, little is known about users’ perceptions of mobile technologies as smoking cessation aids, particularly among disadvantaged individuals who smoke.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the acceptance of mobile technologies for smoking cessation among young adults with low socioeconomic status who smoke.
Methods
In total, 38 current cigarette smokers, 18 to 29 years old, who wanted to quit and did not have a 4-year college degree nor were enrolled in a 4-year college, participated in 12 semistructured digital focus groups. The moderation guide was guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology constructs (ie, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy, and social influence), sentiment (ie, negative, neutral, and positive), and purpose of using mobile technologies (ie, lifestyle and health management and smoking cessation) following a deductive thematic analysis approach.
Results
Participants had positive experiences using mobile technologies for lifestyle and health management, primarily for fitness and dietary purposes. Salient themes were facilitating conditions of use (44/80, 55%), with prior experiences and costs subthemes, followed by perceived usefulness of mobile technologies in helping users attain health goals (22/80, 27.50%), which were generally positive. Ease of use (11/80, 13.75%) and social influences (3/80, 3.75%) were minimally discussed. Conversely, participants had limited awareness of smoking cessation uses of mobile technologies, which was the primary barrier under facilitating conditions discussed (33/51, 64.70%). Participants expressed skepticism about the usefulness of mobile technologies in helping them quit smoking (14/51, 27.45%). Effort expectancy was not discussed, given participants’ limited prior use. Social influences on mobile technology use for smoking cessation were minimally discussed (4/51, 7.84%).
Conclusions
The use of mobile technologies for smoking cessation was unknown to young adults with low socioeconomic status who smoke. To reduce cigarette smoking and associated health disparities, increasing awareness and use of evidence-based mobile-based smoking cessation interventions are needed. Smoking cessation interventions should incorporate features perceived as useful and easy to use to capitalize on positive user experiences and the acceptability of mobile technologies for lifestyle and health management.}

abstract = {This paper presents a groundbreaking and comprehensive study on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a self-driving car utilizing deep reinforcement learning, showcasing significant advancements in autonomous vehicle technology. Our robust framework integrates three innovative AI models for essential functionalities: road detection, traffic sign recognition, and obstacle avoidance. The system architecture, structured around a three layers “DDD” (Data, Detection, Decision) approach, involves meticulous data preprocessing for traffic signs and road data, followed by specialized Deep Learning models for each detection task, including a CNN for traffic signs, a CNN for road detection, and the pre-trained MobileNet-SSD for obstacle detection. A reinforcement learning agent in the Decision Layer processes these outputs for real-time control (steering, acceleration, braking) through a continuous learning process with environmental feedback. The research encompasses both extensive simulation in Unity, leveraging the ML-Agents toolkit for agent training across diverse environments, and crucial real-world deployment. Our reward/punishment system in the simulation environment, based on collisions with road markers and obstacles, refined the agent’s decision-making. The trained AI models were successfully exported and deployed onto a physical prototype, controlled by a Raspberry Pi and equipped with a camera and ultrasonic sensors. Real-world testing affirmed the robust performance of the physical model in detecting roads, recognizing traffic signs, and effectively avoiding obstacles. Quantitative results demonstrate compelling performance, including over 90% accuracy in obstacle detection and a 15% improvement in navigation efficiency compared to traditional algorithms under controlled simulation conditions. Model evaluation metrics show a 98% accuracy, 12% loss, and a prediction rate exceeding 77%. This study not only contributes a comprehensive framework for autonomous vehicle development but also highlights the transformative potential of deep reinforcement learning for creating intelligent and adaptable autonomous systems in both virtual and real-world scenarios, paving the way for safer and more efficient transportation technologies.}

The report issued by the UN in 2022 highlighted that the global education crisis for vulnerable groups has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, war, lack of infrastructure, and little or no psychosocial support. The prevalence of English as the medium of instruction in higher education, is a challenge for students who speak English as a second language. In South Africa, and Africa as a whole, the majority of the population speak in their mother tongue as a first language, which is problematic for students enrolled at English medium universities. This study focuses on accounting education from a South African perspective. Earlier research found that the number of African chartered accountants in South Africa are inadequately represented and cited one of the reasons as being a language barrier. We propose that the translation of accounting concepts into indigenous African languages can improve the understanding of accounting principles which will allow for inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all. In doing so, we develop a prototype application, which encompasses augmented reality and artificial intelligence-generated language translation functionalities to teach accounting principles in an indigenous African language, namely, IsiZulu. The application, named Zulu Augmented Reality Translation (ZART), aids the learning process of accounting principles, by providing an engaging and interactive learning experience in IsiZulu. The paper commences with a literature review on the teaching pedagogy and challenges in accounting education. Thereafter, the design science research applied in the development of ZART is discussed. Using questionnaires, an experiment is conducted to evaluate the usability of ZART, students’ perceptions and pedagogical experiences of using ZART. The results of the evaluation show that ZART was easy to install and use; students were captivated with the avatars in ZART; and the language translation functionality was useful for learning the basics of accounting. ZART is of importance to policy makers and standard setters in the accounting profession, accounting academics, and accounting students. This study provides a platform for the translation of the accounting curriculum into numerous indigenous African languages.}

While fillet color scoring traditionally relies on subjective visual inspection using color reference cards or labor-intensive color measurement using a colorimeter, this study aims to develop a smart handheld device (FilletCam AI, hereafter referred to as ‘FilletCam’) for precise and rapid profiling of fish fillet color. FilletCam comprises an imaging sensor integrated with an embedded computing unit for image acquisition. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to streamline data collection, analysis, visualization, compilation, and data sharing with authorized users. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) model was developed and deployed on the edge for region-of-interest (ROI) detection. A single-stage YOLOv8 model was trained on a custom image dataset comprised of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fillet images to detect the fillet and color palette with their respective SalmonFan™ (SF) score on the reference card. Delta E metric was adopted to compare the color of the fillet and reference color shades on the SF card. The SF score corresponding to the lowest Delta E value was assigned to the fillet. The object detection model performed well and achieved a mean average precision (mAP0.5) of 99.5 % and an F1 score of 0.99. The FilletCam-predicted fillet color scores were compared with the expert ratings and colorimeter scores to evaluate the performance of the developed tool. The minimum Delta E values for FilletCam were consistently lower than those for the colorimeter, indicating FilletCam's ability to detect minor color differences accurately. FilletCam exactly predicted the color scores at 73 % of instances compared to 30 % of instances for the colorimeter. Additionally, for only 3 % of instances, the predicted SF score deviated by more than two points. Overall, the developed research prototype shows promise as a valuable digital tool for the fish processing and retail industries.}

abstract = {Background
Medication review and reconciliation is essential for optimizing drug therapy and minimizing medication errors. Large language models (LLMs) have been recently shown to possess a lot of potential applications in healthcare field due to their abilities of deductive, abductive, and logical reasoning. The present study assessed the abilities of LLMs in medication review and medication reconciliation processes.
Methods
Four LLMs were prompted with appropriate queries related to dosing regimen errors, drug-drug interactions, therapeutic drug monitoring, and genomics-based decision-making process. The veracity of the LLM outputs were verified from validated sources using pre-validated criteria (accuracy, relevancy, risk management, hallucination mitigation, and citations and guidelines). The impacts of the erroneous responses on the patients' safety were categorized either as major or minor.
Results
In the assessment of four LLMs regarding dosing regimen errors, drug-drug interactions, and suggestions for dosing regimen adjustments based on therapeutic drug monitoring and genomics-based individualization of drug therapy, responses were generally consistent across prompts with no clear pattern in response quality among the LLMs. For identification of dosage regimen errors, ChatGPT performed well overall, except for the query related to simvastatin. In terms of potential drug-drug interactions, all LLMs recognized interactions with warfarin but missed the interaction between metoprolol and verapamil. Regarding dosage modifications based on therapeutic drug monitoring, Claude-Instant provided appropriate suggestions for two scenarios and nearly appropriate suggestions for the other two. Similarly, for genomics-based decision-making, Claude-Instant offered satisfactory responses for four scenarios, followed by Gemini for three. Notably, Gemini stood out by providing references to guidelines or citations even without prompting, demonstrating a commitment to accuracy and reliability in its responses. Minor impacts were noted in identifying appropriate dosing regimens and therapeutic drug monitoring, while major impacts were found in identifying drug interactions and making pharmacogenomic-based therapeutic decisions.
Conclusion
Advanced LLMs hold significant promise in revolutionizing the medication review and reconciliation process in healthcare. Diverse impacts on patient safety were observed. Integrating and validating LLMs within electronic health records and prescription systems is essential to harness their full potential and enhance patient safety and care quality.}

abstract = {Background
In oncohematology, both the development of the disease and the side effects of antineoplastic treatment often take a toll on patients’ physical and nutritional well-being. In this era of digital transformation, we launched a pioneering project for oncohematologic patients to promote adherence to a healthy lifestyle and improve their physical and nutritional well-being. We aim to achieve this goal by involving doctors and nutritionists through the Nootric app.
Objective
This study aims to assess the impact of the use of eHealth tools to facilitate nutrition and well-being in oncohematologic patients. We also aim to determine the usefulness of physical-nutritional management in improving tolerance to chemotherapy treatments within routine clinical practice.
Methods
We designed a descriptive, observational, longitudinal, prospective cohort pilot study that included a total of 22 patients from March to May 2022 in the Vinalopó University Hospital. The inclusion criteria were adults over 18 years of age diagnosed with oncohematological pathology in active chemotherapy treatment. An action plan was created to generate alerts between the doctor and the nutritionist. In the beginning, the patients were trained to use the app and received education highlighting the importance of nutrition and physical exercise. Sociodemographic, clinical-biological-analytical (eg, malnutrition index), health care impact, usability, and patient adherence data were collected. Tolerance to chemotherapy treatment and its health care impact were evaluated.
Results
We included 22 patients, 11 (50%) female and 11 (50%) male, ranging between 42 and 84 years of age. Among them, 13 (59%) were adherents to the program. The most frequent diseases were lymphoproliferative syndromes (13/22, 59%) and multiple myeloma (4/22, 18%). Moreover, 15 (68%) out of 22 patients received immunochemotherapy, while 7 (32%) out of 22 patients received biological treatment. No worsening of clinical-biological parameters was observed. Excluding dropouts and abandonments (n=9/22, 41%), the adherence rate was 81%, established by calculating the arithmetic mean of the adherence rates of 13 patients. No admission was observed due to gastrointestinal toxicity or discontinuation of treatment related to alterations in physical and nutritional well-being. In addition, only 5.5% of unscheduled consultations were increased due to incidents in well-being, mostly telematic (n=6/103 consultation are unscheduled). Additionally, 92% of patients reported an improvement in their nutritional habits (n=12/13), and up to 45% required adjustment of medical supportive treatment (n=5/11). There were no cases of grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal toxicity. All of this reflects improved tolerance to treatments. Patients reported a satisfaction score of 4.3 out of 5, while professionals rated their satisfaction at 4.8 out of 5.
Conclusions
We demonstrated the usefulness of integrating new technologies through a multidisciplinary approach. The Nootric app facilitated collaboration among the medical team, nutritionists, and patients. It enabled us to detect health issues related to physical-nutritional well-being, anticipate major complications, and mitigate potentially avoidable risks. Consequently, there was a decrease in unscheduled visits and admissions related to this condition.}

abstract = {Mental health in childhood and adolescence is a complex and evolving concept that goes far beyond the absence of mental illness. It involves achieving critical developmental and emotional milestones, building strong social skills that foster positive relationships, and cultivating resilience through effective coping strategies for life’s challenges. Recognizing mental health as a dynamic process, this view underscores its continuous evolution as young people grow and interact with their surroundings. This commentary is prepared by the coordinators of the meeting on the importance of promoting child mental health, held on 9 November 2024 in Piazzola sul Brenta, Padua, Italy. The event was promoted and supported by the GE Ghirardi Foundation in collaboration with the Union of National European Pediatric Societies and Associations (EPA-UNEPSA), as part of the global initiatives marking World Mental Health Day 2024. The initiative seeks to raise awareness—among healthcare professionals, educators, policymakers, and the wider public—about the essential role of mental health in the overall development of children and adolescents. The commentary provides a concise overview of the key determinants that support a healthy transition to adulthood and highlights the pressing need to protect and nurture the mental well-being of young people during this critical stage of life.}

abstract = {Background
Prevention of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) has been the focus of many system-wide clinical decision support (CDS) tools, which can be directly embedded within the framework of the electronic health record system and triggered to alert in high-risk patients when a known QT-prolonging medication is ordered. Justification for these CDS systems typically lies in the ability to accurately predict which patients are at high risk; however, it is not always evident that identification of risk alone is sufficient for appropriate CDS implementation.
Objective
In this investigation, we examined the impact of a system-wide, alert-based, inpatient CDS tool designed to prevent diLQTS across 10 known QT-prolonging medications.
Methods
We compared the risk of diLQTS, duration of hospitalization, and in- and out-of-hospital mortality before and after implementation of the CDS system in 178,097 hospitalizations among 102,847 patients. We also compared outcomes between those in whom an alert fired and those in whom it did not, and within the various responses to the alert by providers. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, inpatient location, electrolyte values, and comorbidities, with the latter processed using an unsupervised clustering analysis applied to the top 500 most common medications and diagnosis codes, respectively.
Results
We found that the simple, rule-based logic of the CDS (any prior electrocardiograph with heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc)≥500 ms) successfully identified patients at high risk of diLQTS with an odds ratio of 2.28 (95% CI 2.10-2.47, P<.001) among those in whom it fired. However, we did not identify any impact on the risk of diLQTS based on provider responses or on the risk of inpatient, 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year mortality. When compared with rates prior to implementation, the risk of diLQTS was not significantly different after the CDS tools were deployed across the system, although mortality was significantly higher after the tools were implemented.
Conclusions
We found that despite successful identification of high-risk patients for diLQTS, deployment of an alert-based CDS did not impact the risk of diLQTS. These findings suggest that quantification of high risk may be insufficient rationale for implementation of a CDS system and that hospital systems should consider evaluation of the system in its entirety prior to adoption to improve clinical outcomes.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
The association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia remains debated, and data from Mediterranean populations are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between AF and dementia in a large Catalan cohort, with a particular focus on identifying subgroups with the strongest associations.
Methods
We conducted a population-based observational study including individuals aged ≥45 years without prior diagnosis of dementia. Data were obtained from the System for the Development of Research in Primary Care, which covers more than 80% of the Catalan population. Dementia was identified using ICD-10-CM codes and prescription records. Early-onset dementia (EOD) was defined as diagnosis before age 65 years. Participants were followed up from 2009 to 2021. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of incident dementia.
Results
A total of 2 520 839 individuals were included (mean follow-up: 13 years), of whom 79820 (3.25%) had AF at baseline. On univariate analysis, AF was a strong predictor of dementia (HR, 3.39; P<.001). However, after multivariable adjustment, the association was modest (HR, 1.04; P<.001). AF was a stronger independent predictor in individuals aged <70 years (HR, 1.21; P<.001), whereas the association was not significant in those aged ≥70. The strongest association was observed for EOD (HR, 1.36; P<.001). All associations remained consistent in analyses restricted to individuals without prior stroke.
Conclusions
In a large Mediterranean cohort, AF was independently associated with a modest increase in dementia risk, regardless of stroke. This association was stronger in younger individuals and in EOD. These findings highlight the need for studies assessing the impact of early identification and management of AF on dementia incidence in younger populations.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
La relación entre fibrilación auricular (FA) y demencia es controvertida y hay datos limitados en la población mediterránea. Se evaluó la asociación entre FA y demencia en Cataluña, intentando identificar subgrupos de mayor riesgo.
Métodos
Estudio observacional poblacional que incluyó a individuos ≥45 años sin demencia. Los datos se obtuvieron del Sistema de Información para el Desarrollo de la Investigación en Atención Primaria, que cubre más del 80% de la población catalana. La demencia se identificó mediante códigos CIE-10-MC y datos de prescripción farmacológica. Se definió como demencia de inicio temprano (DIT) aquella diagnosticada antes de los 65 años. El seguimiento fue desde 2009 hasta 2021. Los predictores de demencia se evaluaron mediante modelos de regresión de Cox.
Resultados
Se incluyó a 2.520.839 participantes (seguimiento medio de 13 años); 79.820 (3,25%) tenían FA basalmente. La FA fue predictor univariante de demencia (HR=3,39; p<0,001), pero el análisis multivariante reveló una asociación modesta (HR=1,04; p<0,001). La FA fue un predictor independiente más potente en <70 años (HR=1,21; p<0,001) y la asociación fue máxima en DIT (HR=1,36; p<0,001). En cambio, la asociación FA-demencia perdió significación en ≥70 años. Los resultados fueron similares censurando por ictus.
Conclusiones
En una gran cohorte mediterránea, la FA se asoció de forma independiente con un aumento moderado del riesgo de demencia, independientemente del ictus. Esta asociación fue más fuerte en individuos más jóvenes y en DIT. Estos hallazgos subrayan la necesidad de realizar estudios que evalúen el impacto de la identificación y el tratamiento precoz de la FA en la incidencia de la demencia en pacientes jóvenes.}

abstract = {Background
Advance care planning (ACP) is potentially helpful for older adults, however, the rate of uptake in community aged care settings is low. Previous pilot studies suggest that holistic, person-centered ACP approaches may be effective for older adults who experience functional impairment but do not necessarily have life-limiting conditions with clear prognoses. This paper describes the protocol of a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of combined life story work and facilitated ACP in promoting ACP engagement among older adults receiving community aged care services.
Methods
The Enhanced Advance care planning and life Review Longitudinal Intervention (EARLI) trial is an open-label, cross-over, cluster randomized controlled trial with 12 participating aged care organizations in New South Wales and Western Australia. Participants are aged 65 years or older, receiving home care services and capable of providing informed consent at initial recruitment. Recruitment occurs across a two-year period, with study sites randomized to receive the four-session intervention in the first or second year (or a single session ‘active control’ condition). Primary outcomes are participant-reported ACP engagement and ACP documentation in the aged care client record 12 weeks post-recruitment. Secondary outcomes include measures of decisional conflict, anxiety and depression, meaning-based coping and relationship quality. Analysis will take an intention-to-treat approach.
Conclusion
This trial tests a novel method of reaching older adults using a holistic, person-centered approach to promoting ACP engagement. Enhancing ACP engagement may reduce decisional conflict, minimize hospital admissions and improve outcomes for people and their families. ANZCTR Trial Registration ID: ACTRN12622001399785.}

abstract = {Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. The disease manifests as a large spectrum of phenotypes from infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) to late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), depending on the age of symptoms onset. Quantifying GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle provides important information about the disease severity. However, the distribution of GAA and glycogen levels in skeletal muscles from healthy individuals and those impacted by Pompe disease remains poorly understood, and there is currently no universally accepted standard assay for GAA activity measurement. This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the available information on GAA activity and glycogen content levels in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with Pompe disease. A structured review of PubMed and Google Scholar literature (with the latter used to check that no additional publications were identified) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications on glycogen storage disease type II [MeSH term] + GAA, protein human (supplementary concept), Pompe, muscle; and muscle, acid alpha-glucosidase. A limit of English language was applied. Results were grouped by methodologies used to quantify GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle. The search and selection strategy were devised and carried out in line with Preferred Reporting of Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and documented using a flowchart. Bibliographies of papers included in the analysis were reviewed and applicable publications not already identified in the search were included. Of the 158 articles retrieved, 24 (comprising >100 muscle biopsies from >100 patients) were included in the analysis, with four different assays. Analysis revealed that patients with IOPD exhibited markedly lower GAA activity in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD, regardless of the measurement method employed. Additionally, patients with IOPD had notably higher glycogen content levels in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD. In general, however, it was difficult to fully characterize GAA activity because of the different methods used. The findings underscore the challenges in the interpretation and comparison of the results across studies because of the substantial methodological variations. There is a need to establish standardized reference ranges of GAA activity and glycogen content in healthy individuals and in Pompe disease patients based on globally standardized methods to improve comparability and reliability in assessing this rare disease.}

abstract = {Background
The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of independent diagnosis offers a promising solution for optimizing medical resource allocation, especially as their diagnostic accuracy can exceed that of some primary medical staff. However, despite these advancements, many patients exhibit hesitancy toward accepting AI technology, particularly for autonomous diagnostic roles. The mechanisms through which the information quality presented by AI doctors influences patients’ intention to adopt them for independent diagnosis remain unclear.
Objective
This study aimed to examine how the information quality of AI doctors influences patients’ intentions to adopt them for independent diagnosis. Specifically, drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, this study seeks to understand how diagnostic transparency (DT) and diagnostic argument quality (DAQ; as aspects of AI-delivered information) affect patients’ intention to adopt artificial intelligence doctors for independent diagnosis (IAID), with these effects being mediated by perceived expertise (PE) and cognitive trust (CT).
Methods
A scenario-based experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of information quality on patients’ adoption intentions. To test the hypotheses, a 2 (DT: low or high)×2 (DAQ: low or high) between-groups experimental design was used. Each experimental group consisted of 60 valid participants, yielding a total of 240 valid responses. Data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA and partial least squares.
Results
Both DT (β=.157; P=.008) and DAQ (β=.444; P<.001) significantly positively affected patients’ PE. As the central route, the influence of the experimental manipulation of DAQ (mean1 4.55, SD 1.40; mean2 5.68, SD 0.81; F1,236=59.701; P<.001; ηp2=0.202) on PE is more significant than that of DT (mean1 4.92, SD 1.24; mean2 5.31, SD 1.28; F1,236=7.303; P=.007; ηp2=0.030). At the same time, PE has a positive impact on CT (β=.845; P<.001), and CT also positively affected patients’ IAID (β=.679; P<.001). The serial mediation pathway via PE and CT fully mediated the effects of both DT (β=.090; 95% CI 0.017‐0.166) and DAQ (β=.254; 95% CI 0.193‐0.316) on patients’ IAID.
Conclusions
DAQ (central cue) and DT (peripheral cue) influenced patients’ IAID. These effects were fully mediated through a sequential pathway: both cues enhanced PE—with DAQ exerting a significantly stronger effect than DT—which in turn fostered CT, subsequently shaping IAID. Practically, these results highlight that to foster patient adoption, efforts should prioritize enhancing the quality and clarity of AI’s diagnostic arguments, as this pathway more strongly builds PE and, subsequently, CT. This insight is crucial for designing AI doctors that patients will find acceptable and trustworthy for various diagnostic responsibilities.}

abstract = {Background
Virtual reality simulation (VRS) teaching offers nursing students a safe, immersive learning environment with immediate feedback, enhancing learning outcomes. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, nursing students had limited training and opportunities to care for patients in isolation units with infectious diseases. However, the pandemic highlighted the ongoing global priority of providing care for patients with infectious diseases.
Objective
This study aims to (1) examine the effectiveness of VRS in preparing nursing students to care for patients with infectious diseases by assessing its impact on their theoretical knowledge, learning motivation, and attitudes; and (2) evaluate their experiences with VRS.
Methods
This 2-phased mixed methods study recruited third-year undergraduate nursing students enrolled in the Integrated Emergency and Critical Care course at a university in Taiwan. Phase 1 used a quasi-experimental design to address objective 1 by comparing the learning outcomes of students in the VRS teaching program (experimental group) with those in the traditional teaching program (control group). Tools included an infection control written test, the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey, and a learning attitude questionnaire. The experimental group participated in a VRS lesson titled “Caring for a Patient with COVID-19 in the Negative Pressure Unit” as part of the infection control unit. In phase 2, semistructured interviews were conducted to address objective 2, exploring students’ learning experiences.
Results
A total of 107 students participated in phase 1, and 18 students participated in phase 2. Both the VRS and control groups showed significant improvements in theoretical knowledge scores (for the VRS group t46=–7.47; P<.001, for the control group t59=–4.04; P<.001). However, compared with the control group, the VRS group achieved significantly higher theoretical knowledge scores (t98.13=2.70; P=.008) and greater learning attention (t105=2.30; P=.02) at T1. Additionally, the VRS group demonstrated a statistically significant higher regression coefficient for learning confidence compared with the control group (β=.29; P=.03). The students’ learning experiences in the VRS group were categorized into 4 themes: Applying Professional Knowledge to Patient Care, Enhancing Infection Control Skills, Demonstrating Patient Care Confidence, and Engaging in Real Clinical Cases. The core theme identified was Strengthening Clinical Patient Care Competencies.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that VRS teaching significantly enhanced undergraduate nursing students’ infection control knowledge, learning attention, and confidence. Qualitative insights reinforced the quantitative results, highlighting the holistic benefits of VRS teaching in nursing education, including improved learning outcomes. The positive impact on student motivation and attitudes indicates a potentially transformative approach to nursing education, particularly in the post–COVID-19 era, where digital and remote learning tools play an increasingly vital role.}

Industrial computed laminography (ICL) can non-destructively reconstruct the internal morphology of cermet turbine discs. However, the system hardware limitation and the turbine disc structure lead to low quality and resolution of laminographic images. Therefore, ICL system devices were developed, and a super-resolution reconstruction SR-iResASPP network was proposed to reconstruct high-quality super-resolution laminographic images of the turbine disc. First, a high-strength low-absorption loading device and a multi-degree-of-freedom turntable were developed to perform high-quality imaging from the hardware level. On this basis, an SR-iResASPP network was proposed to perform super-resolution reconstruction of turbine disc laminographic images. The proposed network was studied at different magnifications and compared with other super-resolution reconstruction networks. Quantitative analyses show the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 2x super-resolution reconstruction is 31.4212 dB, the information-weighted structural similarity (IW-SSIM) is 0.9544, and the normalized mean absolute distance (NMAD) is 0.1275, which are better than other comparison methods. With the increase of magnification, the PSNR and IW-SSIM decrease, and the NMAD increases to an extent, but image details remain. The improved ICL system and SR-iResASPP network support the high-quality super-resolution morphological reconstruction of new-generation aero-engine core components.}

Providing ongoing support to the increasing number of caregivers as their needs change in the long-term course of dementia is a severe challenge to any health care system. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) operating 24/7 may help to tackle this problem.
Objective
This study describes the development of a generative AI chatbot—the PDC30 Chatbot—and evaluates its acceptability in a mixed methods study.
Methods
The PDC30 Chatbot was developed using the GPT-4o large language model, with a personality agent to constrain its behavior to provide advice on dementia caregiving based on the Positive Dementia Caregiving in 30 Days Guidebook—a laypeople’s resource based on a validated training manual for dementia caregivers. The PDC30 Chatbot’s responses to 21 common questions were compared with those of ChatGPT and another chatbot (called Chatbot-B) as standards of reference. Chatbot-B was constructed using PDC30 Chatbot’s architecture but replaced the latter’s knowledge base with a collection of authoritative sources, including the World Health Organization’s iSupport, By Us For Us Guides, and 185 web pages or manuals by Alzheimer’s Association, National Institute on Aging, and UK Alzheimer’s Society. In the next phase, to assess the acceptability of the PDC30 Chatbot, 21 family caregivers used the PDC30 Chatbot for two weeks and provided ratings and comments on its acceptability.
Results
Among the three chatbots, ChatGPT’s responses tended to be repetitive and not specific enough. PDC30 Chatbot and Chatbot-B, by virtue of their design, produced highly context-sensitive advice, with the former performing slightly better when the questions conveyed significant psychological distress on the part of the caregiver. In the acceptability study, caregivers found the PDC30 Chatbot highly user-friendly, and its responses quite helpful and easy to understand. They were rather satisfied with it and would strongly recommend it to other caregivers. During the 2-week trial period, the majority used the chatbot more than once per day. Thematic analysis of their written feedback revealed three major themes: helpfulness, accessibility, and improved attitude toward AI.
Conclusions
The PDC30 Chatbot provides quality responses to caregiver questions, which are well-received by caregivers. Conversational AI is a viable approach to improve the support of caregivers.}

In recent years, the large amount of available financial data and the heterogeneous contextual information led researchers to investigate data-driven models using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches for forecasting stock prices. Recent methodologies focus mainly on analyzing participants from Reddit without considering other social media and how their combination affects the stock market, which remains an open challenge. In this paper, we combine financial data and textual user-generated information, which are provided as input to various deep learning models, to develop a stock forecasting system. The main novelties of the proposal concern the design of a multi-modal approach combining historical stock prices and sentiment scores extracted by different Online Social Networks (OSNs), also unveiling possible correlations about heterogeneous information evaluated during the GameStop squeeze. In particular, we have examined several AI-based models and investigated the impact of textual data inferred from well-known Online Social Networks (i.e., Reddit and Twitter) on stock market behavior by conducting a case study on GameStop. Although users’ dynamic opinions on social networks may have a detrimental impact on the stock prediction task, our investigation has demonstrated the usefulness of assessing user-generated content inferred from various OSNs on the market forecasting problem.}

abstract = {Background
The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, heavily impacted Taiwan’s health care system, triggering clinical crises and lasting effects among affected individuals and families. The first case in Taiwan was identified on February 25, 2003, and the final case was reported on June 15, 2003. During the epidemic, 346 people were diagnosed with SARS, leading to 37 deaths. Outbreaks also occurred in China, Singapore, and Toronto (Canada), showing the vulnerability of global health systems to new zoonotic diseases. Clinically, SARS causes high fever and severe lung inflammation. Survivors often had long-term lung problems, including fibrosis, and bone issues like osteonecrosis, mostly due to high-dose steroid treatment. Although studies have looked at long-term outcomes—especially lung and bone issues—none followed patients beyond 7 years. The COVID-19 pandemic further revealed gaps in understanding how serious viral infections affect wider health areas, including unintentional and intentional injuries. Data on related hospitalizations also remain limited.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the long-term risk of both unintentional and intentional injuries among survivors of SARS and their relatives, using a nationwide population-based cohort.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, focused on 285 individuals diagnosed with SARS in 2003 and 699 of their relatives, matched in a 1:10 ratio with controls. Injury risks were assessed using Fine and Gray’s competing risk models, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, over a follow-up period of up to 15 years.
Results
Survivors of SARS exhibited a significant increase in the risk of accidental injuries, with an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 1.631 (95% CI 1.184-2.011; P<.001), indicating persistent physiological vulnerabilities postinfection. Family members of survivors of SARS also had elevated injury risk (AHR 1.572, 95% CI 1.148-1.927; P<.001), possibly due to stress and caregiving burdens. Subgroup analysis showed increased risks for poisoning (AHR 2.701, 95% CI 1.956-4.084; P<.001) and falls (AHR 1.524, 95% CI 1.102-1.878; P=.003) among survivors. Relatives faced higher risks for traffic incidents (AHR 2.003, 95% CI 1.462-2.459), poisoning (AHR 1.531, 95% CI 1.120-1.886), medical incidents, falls (AHR 1.802, 95% CI 1.324-2.214), and crushing injuries (AHR 2.469, 95% CI 1.803-3.026; all P<.001). These findings highlight the need for targeted preventive measures to address long-term health risks in both survivors of SARS and their families.
Conclusions
Survivors of SARS and their relatives face increased injury risks, highlighting long-term physical and psychosocial vulnerabilities after severe infectious outbreaks. These findings suggest that health care systems should provide preventive and supportive measures to mitigate long-term impacts for those affected by pandemics.}

abstract = {Background
Depression affects 32% of older adults. Loneliness and social isolation are common risk factors for depression in older adults. Mobile apps can connect users and are also effective in depression management in the general population. However, older adults have specific needs in terms of the content of depression self-care interventions and their accessibility. It remains unknown whether existing apps for depression self-care are applicable to older adults.
Objective
The initial aim of this assessment was to systematically identify interactive depression self-care apps specifically designed for older adults. As we did not find any, we assessed the applicability of existing depression self-care apps to the needs of older adult users.
Methods
Using an established app assessment methodology, we searched for Android and iOS interactive mental health apps providing self-care for depression in English and Chinese in the 42Matters database, Chinese Android app stores, and the first 10 pages of Google and Baidu. We developed an assessment rubric based on extensive revision of the literature. The rubric consisted of the following sections: general characteristics of the apps (eg, developer, platform, and category), app content (eg, epidemiology and risk factors of depression in older adults, techniques to improve mood and well-being), and technical aspects (eg, accessibility, privacy and confidentiality, and engagement).
Results
We identified 23 apps (n=19, 82.6%, English and n=4, 17.4%, Chinese apps), with 5 (21.7%) iOS-only apps, 3 (13%) Android-only apps, and 15 (65.2%) apps on both platforms. None specifically targeted older adults with depression. All apps were designed by commercial companies and were free to download. Most of the apps incorporated cognitive behavior therapy, mood monitoring, or journaling. All but 3 (13%) apps had a privacy and confidentiality policy. In addition, 14 (60.9%) apps covered depression risk factors in older adults, and 3 (13%) apps delivered information about depression epidemiology in older adults via a chatbot. Furthermore, 17 (73.9%) apps mentioned other topics relevant to older adults, such as pain management, grief, loneliness, and social isolation. Around 30% (n=7) of the apps were supported by an online forum. Common accessibility issues included a lack of adaptations for users with visual or hearing impairments and incompatibility with larger font sizes in the phone settings.
Conclusions
There are no depression apps developed specifically for older adults. Available mobile apps have limited applicability to older adults in terms of their clinical and technical features. Depression self-care apps should aim to incorporate content relevant to older adults, such as grief and loss; include online communities; and improve accessibility to adapt to potential health impairments in older adults.}

This work aims to investigate kinetics behaviors from the perspective of enzymatic reaction mechanism. The influences of the CA concentration, type of tertiary amines, pH, and temperature on the reaction rate between CO2 and tertiary amine (ν) and catalytic activity of CA (φ) were first investigated in a stopped-flow device. Adding 50 g∙m⁻³ CA enhanced ν in tertiary amine solutions by a factor ranging from 22 to 42 at 298 K and pH=9.5, demonstrating its excellent catalytic performance. The ν increased with increasing CA concentration, pH, temperature, and tertiary amine's pKa. φ increased with the increase of CA concentration, as well as the decrease of temperature, pH, and tertiary amine's pKa. Proteomics analysis further revealed that conformational changes of the CA's secondary structure induced by high pH and temperature altered the expressions of the local active-site region and deactivated CA, ultimately leading to a decrease in φ. Additionally, the CA-catalysis kinetics equation accorded with the Michaelis-Menten model, with catalytic second-order rate constants on the magnitude of 107. Overall, this work provides a guideline for its industrial application in the CO2 capture process.}

abstract = {Background
The reliability of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art expansive language model specializing in clinical reasoning and medical knowledge, remains largely unverified across non-English languages.
Objective
This study aims to compare fundamental clinical competencies between Japanese residents and GPT-4 by using the General Medicine In-Training Examination (GM-ITE).
Methods
We used the GPT-4 model provided by OpenAI and the GM-ITE examination questions for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 to conduct a comparative analysis. This analysis focused on evaluating the performance of individuals who were concluding their second year of residency in comparison to that of GPT-4. Given the current abilities of GPT-4, our study included only single-choice exam questions, excluding those involving audio, video, or image data. The assessment included 4 categories: general theory (professionalism and medical interviewing), symptomatology and clinical reasoning, physical examinations and clinical procedures, and specific diseases. Additionally, we categorized the questions into 7 specialty fields and 3 levels of difficulty, which were determined based on residents’ correct response rates.
Results
Upon examination of 137 GM-ITE questions in Japanese, GPT-4 scores were significantly higher than the mean scores of residents (residents: 55.8%, GPT-4: 70.1%; P<.001). In terms of specific disciplines, GPT-4 scored 23.5 points higher in the “specific diseases,” 30.9 points higher in “obstetrics and gynecology,” and 26.1 points higher in “internal medicine.” In contrast, GPT-4 scores in “medical interviewing and professionalism,” “general practice,” and “psychiatry” were lower than those of the residents, although this discrepancy was not statistically significant. Upon analyzing scores based on question difficulty, GPT-4 scores were 17.2 points lower for easy problems (P=.007) but were 25.4 and 24.4 points higher for normal and difficult problems, respectively (P<.001). In year-on-year comparisons, GPT-4 scores were 21.7 and 21.5 points higher in the 2020 (P=.01) and 2022 (P=.003) examinations, respectively, but only 3.5 points higher in the 2021 examinations (no significant difference).
Conclusions
In the Japanese language, GPT-4 also outperformed the average medical residents in the GM-ITE test, originally designed for them. Specifically, GPT-4 demonstrated a tendency to score higher on difficult questions with low resident correct response rates and those demanding a more comprehensive understanding of diseases. However, GPT-4 scored comparatively lower on questions that residents could readily answer, such as those testing attitudes toward patients and professionalism, as well as those necessitating an understanding of context and communication. These findings highlight the strengths and limitations of artificial intelligence applications in medical education and practice.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical reasoning (CR) is an essential skill; yet, physicians often receive limited feedback. Artificial intelligence holds promise to fill this gap.
Objective
We report the development of named entity recognition (NER), logic-based and large language model (LLM)–based assessments of CR documentation in the electronic health record across 2 institutions (New York University Grossman School of Medicine [NYU] and University of Cincinnati College of Medicine [UC]).
Methods
The note corpus consisted of internal medicine resident admission notes (retrospective set: July 2020-December 2021, n=700 NYU and 450 UC notes and prospective validation set: July 2023-December 2023, n=155 NYU and 92 UC notes). Clinicians rated CR documentation quality in each note using a previously validated tool (Revised-IDEA), on 3-point scales across 2 domains: differential diagnosis (D0, D1, and D2) and explanation of reasoning, (EA0, EA1, and EA2). At NYU, the retrospective set was annotated for NER for 5 entities (diagnosis, diagnostic category, prioritization of diagnosis language, data, and linkage terms). Models were developed using different artificial intelligence approaches, including NER, logic-based model: a large word vector model (scispaCy en_core_sci_lg) with model weights adjusted with backpropagation from annotations, developed at NYU with external validation at UC, NYUTron LLM: an NYU internal 110 million parameter LLM pretrained on 7.25 million clinical notes, only validated at NYU, and GatorTron LLM: an open source 345 million parameter LLM pretrained on 82 billion words of clinical text, fined tuned on NYU retrospective sets, then externally validated and further fine-tuned at UC. Model performance was assessed in the prospective sets with F1-scores for the NER, logic-based model and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for the LLMs.
Results
At NYU, the NYUTron LLM performed best: the D0 and D2 models had AUROC/AUPRC 0.87/0.79 and 0.89/0.86, respectively. The D1, EA0, and EA1 models had insufficient performance for implementation (AUROC range 0.57-0.80, AUPRC range 0.33-0.63). For the D1 classification, the approach pivoted to a stepwise approach taking advantage of the more performant D0 and D2 models. For the EA model, the approach pivoted to a binary EA2 model (ie, EA2 vs not EA2) with excellent performance, AUROC/AUPRC 0.85/ 0.80. At UC, the NER, D-logic–based model was the best performing D model (F1-scores 0.80, 0.74, and 0.80 for D0, D1, D2, respectively. The GatorTron LLM performed best for EA2 scores AUROC/AUPRC 0.75/ 0.69.
Conclusions
This is the first multi-institutional study to apply LLMs for assessing CR documentation in the electronic health record. Such tools can enhance feedback on CR. Lessons learned by implementing these models at distinct institutions support the generalizability of this approach.}

Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown benefits in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the extrapolability of clinical trial results to general populations remains limited. This study evaluated the impact of early in-hospital SGLT2i prescription on ADHF outcomes in a real-world setting.
Methods
Prospective cohort study. Adults with ADHF from a third-level cardiovascular center were included. The primary analysis compared early SGLT2i (prescribed within 48hours of admission) versus late SGLT2i (prescribed after 48hours). A secondary analysis included patients not receiving in-hospital SGLT2i. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, 30-day improvement in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score, 30-day rehospitalization due to heart failure, and 30-day all-cause mortality.
Results
Of 2016 patients, early SGLT2i (≤ 48h) was initiated in 1275 (63.2%) patients, late SGLT2i in 346 (17.2%), and 395 (19.6%) did not receive in-hospital SGLT2i. After multivariate adjustment, early versus late SGLT2i use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.17-0.77) and reduced hospital stay (mean difference −5.70 days; 95%CI, −7.05 to −4.34). Similarly, early versus late or no in-hospital SGLT2i use was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (RR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.14-0.44), reduced hospital stay (mean difference −2.99 days; 95%CI, −4.05 to −1.92), and lower 30-day combined mortality/heart failure rehospitalization (RR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.53-0.98).
Conclusions
Early in-hospital SGLT2i prescription was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes in ADHF in a real-world setting.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Aunque los inhibidores del cotransportador de sodio-glucosa tipo 2 (iSGLT2) han mostrado beneficios en la insuficiencia cardiaca aguda descompensada (ICAD), la extrapolabilidad de los beneficios observados en los ensayos clínicos a la población general sigue siendo limitada. Este estudio evaluó el impacto de la prescripción temprana de iSGLT2 durante la estancia hospitalaria sobre los desenlaces de la ICAD en un contexto del mundo real.
Métodos
Estudio de cohorte prospectiva. Se incluyeron adultos con ICAD de un centro cardiovascular de tercer nivel. El análisis primario comparó iSGLT2 temprano (prescrito en las 48 horas siguientes al ingreso) frente a iSGLT2 tardío (prescrito después de 48 horas). Un análisis secundario incluyó a los pacientes que no recibieron iSGLT2 durante su estancia. El desenlace primario fue la mortalidad intrahospitalaria. Los desenlaces secundarios incluyeron la duración de la estancia hospitalaria, la mejoría a los 30 días en la puntuación del Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, la rehospitalización a los 30 días por IC y la mortalidad por todas las causas a los 30 días.
Resultados
De 2.016 pacientes, se inició iSGLT2 temprano (≤ 48h) en 1.275 (63,2%) pacientes, iSGLT2 tardío en 346 (17,2%), y 395 (19,6%) no recibieron iSGLT2 intrahospitalario. Tras el ajuste multivariante, el uso temprano frente al tardío de iSGLT2 se asoció con una disminución de la mortalidad intrahospitalaria (RR=0,37; IC95%, 0,17-0,77) y una reducción de la estancia hospitalaria (diferencia media −5,70 días; IC95%, −7,05 a −4,34). Del mismo modo, el uso temprano de iSGLT2 en comparación con el uso tardío o la ausencia de uso se asoció con una disminución de la mortalidad hospitalaria (RR=0,25; IC95%, 0,14-0,44), una reducción de la estancia hospitalaria (diferencia media −2,99 días; IC95%, −4,05 a −1,92) y una reducción de la combinación de mortalidad y rehospitalización por IC a los 30 días (RR=0,72; IC95%, 0,53-0,98).
Conclusiones
La prescripción temprana intrahospitalaria de iSGLT2 se asoció con mejores desenlaces cardiovasculares en la ICAD en un contexto del mundo real.}

abstract = {Background
The development of surgical skills is a key component of the medical education curriculum. While simulation-based medical education approaches are increasingly adopted to facilitate skills development in a safe, standardized and realistic manner, mental imagery (MI) has been considered as an emerging approach for surgical skills development. MI is defined as the mental rehearsal of tasks without motor performance and has demonstrated effective skills development in industries such as elite sport and aviation. However, its benefit has yet to be explored and utilized in the medical school curriculum. This scoping review seeks to evaluate the current literature to characterize efficacy of MI interventions for the surgical skills development of medical students.
Methods
A scoping review was performed following a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Emcare databases. Articles evaluating the outcomes related to the impact of MI interventions on the development of technical and nontechnical surgical skills among medical students were included.
Results
MI-based programs among medical students improve certain areas of technical and nontechnical surgical skills performance such as in laparoscopic performance, fluidity and with co-benefits of improved stress management and low cost. However, inconsistencies were observed in findings across studies, with mixed results across the technical and nontechnical surgical skills assessed. This was largely attributed to significant study heterogeneity of the underlying evidence.
Conclusions
Despite the emerging evidence suggesting MI-based programs as an effective adjunct to the current surgical skills development, there are important limitations to the quality of the evidence. Our scoping review highlights the need for prospective research with standardized MI programs assessing surgical skills at the expected scope of competency for medical students to further characterize the utility of MI-based programs in the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) surgical skills curriculum, particularly in areas of medical knowledge, professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills.}

Optimized disease detection methods enhance efficiency, sustainability and economic viability, making non-destructive health assessment vital for modern agricultural practices. This study aims to differentiate grapevine varieties based on their spectral characteristics using multispectral imaging. Focusing on grapevine canopies within a vineyard in the Attica region of Greece, this research proposes a methodology for aerial multispectral images exploitation captured over two consecutive years, namely 2022 and 2023. Unlike typical vineyards with limited grape varieties, the study area included over 70 varieties, each with relatively small sample sizes. Classification algorithms were employed to separate vines from soil and shadows, with the Maximum Likelihood algorithm achieving 98.79% and 90.53% accuracy for the 2022 and 2023 images, respectively. Vegetation indices were applied to assess vine health, chlorophyll content and canopy density. Among seven indices, the Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (CVI) and Vegetation Ratio Index (RVI) were selected due to their low correlation. Six clustering algorithms were tested, with the Bisecting K-means algorithm proving the most effective, achieving a silhouette value of 0.41. Comparative analysis between the 2022 and 2023 clusters revealed that 34 vine varieties maintained stable health, 24 improved and 15 worsened. This study underscores the potential of multispectral imaging and clustering algorithms in vineyard management, offering insights to optimize cultivation practices based on spectral data.}

abstract = {Background
The built environment is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in promoting physical fitness (PF). However, there is a lack of research examining the relationship between the built environment and PF, and this study aims to address this gap.
Methods
The study utilizes data from the Children's Growth Environment, Lifestyle, Physical, and Mental Health Development Project (COHERENCE) in Guangzhou, China. This project collects annual data on PF and demographic information of primary and high school students from 2016/17 to 2019/20 academic year. The built environment data around participants' residential neighborhoods is obtained based on the 5Ds framework.
Results
Among the 96,402 participants, aged 8.66 (1.88) years old, 51,363 (53.3%) were boys. The fitted restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve revealed a reverse N-shaped relationship between population density and PF. Threshold analysis discovered that when the distance from the residential address to the nearest public transport station was not more than 470 m, a longer distance was associated with better PF [β (Unstandardized coefficient) = 0.764, 95%CI (Confidence Interval) = 0.297, 1.230].
Conclusions
This large population-based study suggests that there is an urgent need for community-scale policies related to built environment in order to enhance the PF of Chinese children and adolescents.}

Over the past decades, significant technological advancements, such as the normalization of computers and the popularization of mobile devices, have transformed and revolutionized our learning paradigms. Education has transitioned from the bricks-and-mortar, teacher fronted, and textbook-based teaching to out-of-class, student-centered, and inquiry-based learning. Since 2020, emerging technologies such as the Metaverse and artificial intelligence have shown great potential in expanding learning opportunities, ranging from the location of learning and teaching, the student-teacher machine interactions, to different modes of instruction and learning. In particular, the Metaverse has the power to transform the way peer feedback is provided, which is an essential aspect of effective education. This position paper aims to shed some light on the intersection of peer feedback and the Metaverse. It starts with a review of the classic sociocultural learning theory and the historical use of technology to support peer feedback, followed by an introduction to the definition and features of the Metaverse technology. Then, the paper proposes a tentative model about how the Metaverse can be utilized to facilitate peer feedback. It ends with important questions for educators and learners to contemplate in order to make the most of this new technology in improving the provision and uptake of peer feedback.}

abstract = {Background
Understanding the factors contributing to mental well-being in youth is a public health priority. Self-reported enthusiasm for the future may be a useful indicator of well-being and has been shown to forecast social and educational success. Typically, cross-domain measures of ecological and health-related factors with relevance to public policy and programming are analyzed either in isolation or in targeted models assessing bivariate interactions. Here, we capitalize on a large provincial data set and machine learning to identify the sociodemographic, experiential, behavioral, and other health-related factors most strongly associated with levels of subjective enthusiasm for the future in a large sample of elementary and secondary school students.
Objective
The aim of this study was to identify the sociodemographic, experiential, behavioral, and other health-related factors associated with enthusiasm for the future in elementary and secondary school students using machine learning.
Methods
We analyzed data from 13,661 participants in the 2019 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS) (grades 7-12) with complete data for our primary outcome: self-reported levels of enthusiasm for the future. We used 50 variables as model predictors, including demographics, perception of school experience (i.e., school connectedness and academic performance), physical activity and quantity of sleep, substance use, and physical and mental health indicators. Models were built using a nonlinear decision tree–based machine learning algorithm called extreme gradient boosting to classify students as indicating either high or low levels of enthusiasm. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were used to interpret the generated models, providing a ranking of feature importance and revealing any nonlinear or interactive effects of the input variables.
Results
The top 3 contributors to higher self-rated enthusiasm for the future were higher self-rated physical health (SHAP value=0.62), feeling that one is able to discuss problems or feelings with their parents (SHAP value=0.49), and school belonging (SHAP value=0.32). Additionally, subjective social status at school was a top feature and showed nonlinear effects, with benefits to predicted enthusiasm present in the mid-to-high range of values.
Conclusions
Using machine learning, we identified key factors related to self-reported enthusiasm for the future in a large sample of young students: perceived physical health, subjective school social status and connectedness, and quality of relationship with parents. A focus on perceptions of physical health and school connectedness should be considered central to improving the well-being of youth at the population level.}

abstract = {GenAI harnesses vast amounts of personal data, specifically facial images, to achieve remarkable generative capabilities. As it continues to evolve and integrate into various applications, this practice has raised significant privacy concerns. Current state-of-the-art facial privacy-preserving methods predominantly utilize a generative paradigm, where sensitive facial features, such as identity information or specific attributes, are extracted and subsequently sanitized. The fusion of these sanitized feature with other non- or soft-biometric attributes is executed to generate privacy-ensured synthetic faces. However, these methods always generate faces of insufficient security and low realism. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuShield, a novel facial privacy-preserving method that integrates identity and attribute hiding based on diffusion model. DiffuShield enables configurable, confidential, and practical facial privacy preservation by allowing selective preservation of identities and sensitive attributes. It adopts the diffusion model as the backbone generative network and introduces identity and attribute encoders as conditional inputs. These two encoders can efficiently decompose facial representations while incorporating differential privacy mechanisms by introducing Laplacian noise, thereby achieving flexible facial privacy preservation. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffuShield not only excels in preserving privacy but also maintains image quality and compatibility with various computer vision tasks. This balance of privacy and performance positions DiffuShield as a robust solution for real-world applications requiring both privacy preservation and functionality.}

Mangrove wetlands derived fungus, Aspergillus aculeatus, emerged as a promising candidate, capable of removing approximately 40% of chloride ions in environments with concentration of 15% (w/v), representative of industrial wastewater conditions. Transcriptomics and biochemical assays conducted under increasing salt conditions revealed that elevated chloride concentrations induce the expression and activity of S-adenosyl methionine-dependent methyltransferase, which facilitates the conversion of chloride into chloromethane. This is the first report characterizing the biological mechanism behind high salt tolerance and chloride removal capacity of Aspergillus aculeatus. This salt remediation mechanism may work as a starter for developing future bioremediation strategies to treat high-chloride wastewater using fungi, offering an eco-friendly alternative to traditional physical or chemical methods.}

abstract = {Background
Synchronous oligometastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SOESCC), characterized by a limited number of metastases at diagnosis, represents a significant subset of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, the optimal treatment modality for the condition has not been determined. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of local consolidative radiotherapy (cRT) for the primary tumor combined with first-line chemoimmunotherapy (CIT).
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included 102 patients with SOESCC who underwent first-line CIT, either alone or in combination with cRT, between 2018 and 2022. We analyzed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the two groups using propensity score matching (PSM). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors. Failure patterns were compared between groups.
Results
Patients who received the additional cRT had longer PFS (median PFS, 11.5 vs. 8.3 months, P = 0.009) than did those who received CIT only; however, no significant difference was noted in OS (median OS, 20.0 vs. 17.0 months, P = 0.410) between the two groups. These results remained consistent after PSM and multivariate Cox regression analyses (PFS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.539, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.312–0.932, P = 0.027; OS: HR 0.580, 95% CI 0.307–1.095, P = 0.093). Notably, the pattern of failure in the CIT group was primarily characterized by locoregional failure, in contrast to the distant failure observed in the CIT + cRT group. Locoregional failure-free survival in the CIT + cRT group was significantly lower than that in the CIT group (P < 0.001). Moreover, no statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events between the two groups.
Conclusions
In patients with SOESCC, the combination of local cRT and first-line CIT prolonged PFS without increasing treatment-related toxicity. In addition, cRT for primary tumor significantly reduced the incidence of locoregional failure. This synergistic approach appears to be a viable and potentially superior treatment strategy for the treatment of SOESCC.}

abstract = {Background
Preeclampsia is prevalent in women with diabetes, but the mechanism is unclear. We previously found that oxidized, glycated lipoproteins robustly upregulated soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1), a key mediator of preeclampsia. Here, we determined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) and its subtypes in sFlt1 regulation in placental trophoblasts, and whether this mechanism might mediate the effect of modified lipoproteins.
Methods
Cultured human HTR8/SVneo and BeWo trophoblasts were treated with the PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) for 24h, ± PKC inhibitors GF109203X (general), Ro31-8220 (PKCα-selective), LY333531 (PKCβ-selective) and rottlerin (PKCδ-selective). The effect of ‘heavily oxidized, glycated’ low-density lipoproteins (HOG-LDL) vs. native LDL (N-LDL), ± high glucose (30 mM), was evaluated in HTR8/SVneo cells. sFlt1 secretion (ELISA), mRNA expression (RT-qPCR), and cellular PKC activity were measured.
Results
PMA stimulated robust sFlt1 release and mRNA expression in both cell lines; these effects were inhibited by GF109203X, Ro31-8220 and LY333531 in a concentration-dependent manner. Rottlerin inhibited sFlt1 in BeWo, but modestly enhanced it in HTR8/SVneo cells. HOG-LDL enhanced PKC activity vs. N-LDL in HTR8/SVneo cells. Also, HOG-LDL, but not high glucose, significantly increased sFlt1 secretion and mRNA expression; this response was inhibited by GF109203X, Ro31-8220 and LY333531 at concentrations comparable to those that blocked PMA induction of sFlt1.
Conclusion
Modified lipoproteins upregulate sFlt1 in trophoblasts via a PKC-mediated mechanism, involving at least α and β isoforms. The data suggest potential therapeutic targets to reduce the risk of preeclampsia in women with diabetes.}

SIBP04 is a biosimilar of bevacizumab (Avastin®, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). This study evaluated the equivalence of SIBP04 to Avastin® as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (nsqNSCLC).
Methods
In this randomized, double-blind, multi-center, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsqNSCLC from 58 hospitals at China. Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive SIBP04 or Avastin® (15 mg/kg) combined with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin (area under curve [AUC] = 5.0, no more than 800 mg) (PC) regimens intravenously (3-week cycles, up to six cycles) followed by SIBP04 maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), defined as the best overall response from the first dose to the 18th week, assessed by the independent review committee (IRC) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Clinical equivalence of the primary endpoint was done by comparing the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ORR ratio (SIBP04 plus PC vs. Avastin® plus PC) in the per-protocol set (PPS) populaiton with the prespecified equivalence margin of 0.75–1.33. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, disease control rate, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacological bioequivalence of steady-state trough concentrations.
Results
From April 17, 2020, to April 20, 2021, 517 patients were randomly assigned to receive SIBP04 plus PC (n = 259) or Avastin® plus PC (n = 258). The ORR of the SIBP04 plus PC group was 55.6% (95% CI, 49.3–61.8) and that of the Avastin® plus PC group was 59.3% (95% CI, 53.0–65.4) in the full analysis set (FAS) population (P = 0. 3944). The ORR of the SIBP04 plus PC group was 62.6% (95% CI, 55.8–69.0) and that of the Avastin® plus PC group was 64.7% (95% CI, 58.0–71.0) in the PPS population (P = 0.6448). The ORR ratio (SIBP04 plus PC vs. Avastin® plus PC) was 0.94 (90% CI, 0.8270–1.0621) in the FAS population and 0.97 (90% CI, 0.8578–1.0900) in the PPS population, respectively, both within the prespecified equivalence margin of 0.75–1.33. Other efficacy endpoints, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics were all comparable across the groups.
Conclusions
SIBP04 showed equivalent efficacy and safety profile to Avastin® in patients with locally advanced or metastatic nsqNSCLC. SIBP04 plus PC regimen will offer an alternative first-line treatment option for this patient population.

abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and is related to other diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Fucoidan has been shown to exert potential anti-obesity effects. Hence, the present study systematically reviewed recent articles on the anti-obesity effects of fucoidan intake in obese animal models. The PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for relevant articles. Sixty-nine articles were identified from the initial literature search. Among them, 17 articles were selected for data extraction. The methodological quality was evaluated using the SYRCLE RoB tool, and the R software was used to perform a meta-analysis. The outcomes of the meta-analysis were alterations in body weight, blood lipid profiles (triglycerides [TG], total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]), obesity-related hormones (adiponectin, leptin), and inflammation markers (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF- α]). The meta-analysis indicated that fucoidan intake significantly reduced body weight (standardized mean difference [95% confidence interval]: −2.44 [−3.17, −1.72]), TG (−2.83 [−3.49, −2.17]), TC (−4.39 [−5.83, −2.96]), LDL-C (−2.91 [−3.97, −1.84]), and leptin (−5.71 [−8.01, −3.40]) compared with the control. Moreover, fucoidan intake was associated with significant improvement in adiponectin (5.09 [3.23, 6.96]), leptin (−5.71 [−8.01, −3.40]), and TNF-α levels (−2.97 [−4.07, −1.87]). Subgroup analyses of the outcomes, including sources, intervention type, duration, molecular size, and dose, were performed. Fucoidan supplementation was sufficiently effective in preventing obesity at concentrations above 50 mg/kg, intervention duration of <12 weeks, and low-molecular size (<10 kDa). Therefore, fucoidan supplementation has the potential to prevent obesity.}

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a multifunctional polysaccharide which has been extensively used in the food and biomedical industry. However, how HA is degraded and fermented by Bacteroides spp. has not been fully characterized. Here, we comprehensively investigated the detailed degradation profiles and fermentation characteristics of four different HAs with discrete molecular weight (Mw) by fourteen distinctive Bacteroides spp. from the human gut microbiota. Our results indicated that high-Mw HAs were more degradable and fermentable than low-Mw HAs. Interestingly, B. salyersiae showed the best degrading capability for both high-Mw and low-Mw HAs, making it a keystone species for HA degradation among Bacteroides spp.. Specifically, HA degradation by B. salyersiae produced significant amounts of unsaturated tetrasaccharide (udp4). Co-culture experiments indicated that the produced udp4 could be further fermented and utilized by non-proficient HA-degraders, suggesting a possible cross-feeding interaction in the utilization of HA within the Bacteroides spp.. Altogether, our study provides novel insights into the metabolism of HA by the human gut microbiota, which has considerable implications for the development of new HA-based nutraceuticals and medicines.}

abstract = {Background
National and international guidelines advocate for a multimodal approach to treating adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), combining pharmacotherapy with psychological interventions. While recent reviews support cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a viable treatment for ADHD in adults, evidence remains limited. Another challenge is the availability of psychological interventions, with stimulants remaining the primary treatment choice for adults with ADHD. One promising approach to increasing access to psychological interventions is the dissemination of internet-delivered CBT.
Objective
This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a guided web-based stress management program specifically designed for working adults with ADHD. The intervention aimed to enhance quality of life by addressing stress, exhaustion, anxiety, and depression, commonly experienced by this population.
Methods
Thirty-six participants took part in a single-arm open trial, with assessments before, during, and after the intervention. The intervention consisted of 12 modules based on CBT principles, focusing on executive functioning, stress management, and emotion regulation, with clinician support on demand. Primary and secondary outcomes included quality of life (Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale [AAQoL]), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS-10]), exhaustion (Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale [KEDS]), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale [GAD-7]), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]), and ADHD symptoms (the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale [ASRS]).
Results
Results indicated a statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality of life (Cohen d=0.84), and a reduction in ADHD symptoms (d=0.98), as well as statistically significant reductions in perceived stress (d=0.83), exhaustion (d=1.12), anxiety (d=1.70), and depression (d=1.25). Improvements were sustained at a 12-week follow-up. A clinically significant improvement in quality of life was observed in 36% (13/36) of participants. Participants reported high satisfaction with the program and the guidance. Adherence was high, with an overall assessment response rate of 84%, a mean of 78% of modules opened, and no explicit dropouts. Twelve of the 36 participants reported negative effects. Qualitative content analysis of participants’ written feedback revealed positive experiences and suggestions for improvement.
Conclusions
This study suggests promise for web-delivered interventions tailored to the needs of adults with ADHD, pending further research and development in controlled studies.

abstract = {Geospatial modeling aims to integrate multiple geospatial data sources and geoprocessing functions based on user application demands to address complex geospatial challenges. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in semantic understanding and task planning, their limited geospatial domain knowledge still hinders their efficiency in geospatial modeling. Therefore, there is an urgent need to integrate geospatial knowledge with the inherent semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs, enabling their effective application in specialized geospatial domains. In this study, we introduce GeoGraphRAG, a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach tailored for geospatial modeling. Specifically, GeoGraphRAG utilizes LLMs as intelligent agents to identify user demands, retrieve relevant subgraphs from external graph knowledge base, and injects both structural and semantic information into the LLM. Through the graph-driven solution planning phase, GeoGraphRAG automatically generates modeling solutions and geospatial code in response to specific user demands. The proposed method is evaluated against different baseline approaches across various LLMs based on the benchmark dataset designed for geospatial modeling, and a representative application scenario is presented to illustrate its practical effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the injection of graph-structured knowledge improves both the efficiency and interpretability of LLM-based geospatial modeling, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach. GeoGraphRAG represents the first attempt to introduce graph-based RAG into geospatial modeling and provides novel insights for future research and practical applications in this field.}

abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are carbon-based chemicals characterized by high vapor pressure and low boiling points under standard temperature and pressure conditions. VOCs are categorized as exogenous or endogenous, depending on their source. Endogenous VOCs are metabolic byproducts eliminated via respiration. These compounds serve as indicators of human metabolic activity, reflecting differences in tumors compared to normal cell metabolism and the body's response to tumors. Examination of exhaled breath provides a noninvasive approach for assessing metabolic status by comparing VOC levels. Consequently, VOCs are increasingly studied as novel biomarkers for cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment efficacy prediction. This review outlines VOC production mechanisms, their presence in tumor types, detection methodologies, and their implications for tumor screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. Nonetheless, challenges remain in the utilization of VOCs for cancer diagnosis and predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, this review discusses unresolved issues requiring attention to improve malignant tumor assessment, providing insights into their diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.}

Results show a 1 % increase in new industrial robot installations per 10,000 workers reduces the unemployment rate by 0.037 %-0.039 %. The impact is more pronounced for male workers (0.045 %) than female workers (0.033 %), and youth unemployment is more significantly affected. Lastly, automation is found to reduce the unemployment rate by 0.052 % for people with intermediate education, yet with little effect on those with basic or advanced educational attainment.}

abstract = {Background
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic, progressive condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. In addition to the daily challenges that HF poses, acute exacerbations can lead to costly hospitalizations and increased mortality. High health care costs and the burden of HF have led to the emerging application of new technologies to support people living with HF to stay well while living in the community. However, many digital solutions have not involved consumers and health care professionals in their design, leading to poor adoption. The SmartHeart project aimed to codevelop a smart health ecosystem to support the early detection of HF deterioration and encourage self-care, potentially preventing hospitalizations.
Objective
This study aims to provide an overview of the SmartHeart project by describing our approach to designing the SmartHeart system, outlining its features, and describing the planned pilot study to determine the feasibility of the system.
Methods
We used the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework to guide the development of the SmartHeart system, involving users (people with HF and their caregivers) and stakeholders (health care providers involved in the management of HF) in its design. SmartHeart is a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system. It includes 2 user interfaces for patients: an Amazon Alexa conversational agent and a smartphone app. The system collects physiological, symptom, and behavioral data through wireless sensors and self-reports from users. These data are processed and analyzed to provide personalized health insights, self-care support, and alerts in case of health deterioration. The system also includes a web-based user interface for health care professionals, allowing them to access data, send messages to users, and receive notifications about potential health deterioration. A single-arm, multicenter pilot trial (N=20) is planned to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SmartHeart before evaluation through a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome will be a description of the study's feasibility (recruitment, attrition, engagement, and changes in self-care).
Results
The SmartHeart study started in January 2021 on procurement of funding. Recruitment for the pilot trial started in August 2024 and will be completed by March 2025. We have currently enrolled 12 participants. Follow-up of all participants will be completed by the end of May 2025.
Conclusions
We have co-designed and developed a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system for the early detection of HF deterioration and prevention of HF-related hospitalizations. The next step is a pilot study, which will provide valuable information on feasibility and preliminary effects to inform a larger evaluation trial. SmartHeart has the potential to augment existing health services and help people with HF stay well while living in the community.

abstract = {Authors have described selected problems related to valuation and value creation of Internet related companies. In case of intangible assets related to the new economy and Internet companies, valuation is usually much more complicated due to rapid volatility, limited historical information and constantly emerging new technologies that change the image of the market. The same situation is in case of young companies, which current, tangible assets are of little value, while the value of the company is concentrated in intangible assets and development options The paper presents general valuation indicators for Internet companies, which are a root point for a client division allowing a further model improvement. Based on the Internet companies evaluation indicators review, authors decided that for this proposal, the division between one-time (non-loyal) and repetitive (loyal) customers is of the greatest use. Following, the method of valuing companies based on valuation of Customer Lifetime Value was described. Considering different kinds of the Internet clients, a valuation model for one time and continuous relation was proposed. Authors suggest modifying traditional model by dividing the customers into two segments. The consumer's loyalty measured by behavioral outcome - the frequency of purchase is the criteria of segmentation. Such segmentation allows better extrapolation of company's value.}

abstract = {A rapid increase in plastic pollution is a major threat to the environment. One intriguing group of enzymes that can act as biocatalysts for the breakdown of polymers is lipase. This study reports the production of lipase from Aspergillus niger MG654699.1 utilizing agro-industrial residue (wheat bran) through solid-state fermentation. The produced lipase showed 176.55 U/mL of activity, 7.18 mg/mL of protein content, and 24.60 U/mg of specific activity under the optimal conditions of 37°C and pH 7.0. The biocatalytic activity of 30 KDa lipase resulted in 3.8%, 3.6%, and 5% weight loss of PE (polyethylene), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), and PS (polystyrene), respectively. Application of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the lipase-mediated deterioration of treated polymer samples. The alterations in functional groups and surface structures of the samples showed the chemical and physical impact of the applied enzyme. The findings of this study showed that lipase can be employed as an eco-friendly and green biocatalyst for effective depolymerization and deterioration of environmental plastic waste.}
