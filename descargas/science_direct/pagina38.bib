abstract = {As technology becomes increasingly embedded in English as a foreign language (EFL) education, understanding the pedagogical potential of tools like ChatGPT is essential. This phenomenological study investigates how ChatGPT facilitates L2 development from the perspectives of senior EFL students. A purposive sample of 21 students (9 males, 12 females) engaged with ChatGPT over a 12-month period. Data were gathered through participant diaries and semi-structured interviews, analyzed via phenomenological methods to capture the essence of their experiences. The analysis uncovered four key categories: (e.g., expanded vocabulary, promoted grammar accuracy, and improved pronunciation), interactive language practice (e.g., real-time conversations and instant feedback), personalized learning experience (e.g., adaptive learning path, targeted skill improvement, and self-paced learning), and enriched learning environments (e.g., conversational AI companionship, gamification element, and continuous learning support). These findings evidence that ChatGPT can be considered as a valuable resource in EFL instruction because its personalized, interactive features can significantly support language acquisition and learner engagement.}

We addressed this gap by conducting a text-mining analysis of 12,467 user comments on social media related to AI influencers. In addition, we surveyed 978 followers of AI influencers, employing structural equation modeling (SEM) to delineate the affordances of AI influencers. The thematic analysis extracted four key AI affordances, namely modality, autonomy, guidance, and interactivity, that positively shape AI influencers’ perceived humanness and trust, which in-turn drives purchase intention and active engagement. These findings offer multi-method evidence on how the strategic use of AI affordances shapes consumer perceptions and behaviors in human-AI interactions.}

abstract = {L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the treatment of choice for Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor symptoms, but its chronic use is hindered by complications such as dyskinesia. Pre-clinical studies discovered that activation of metabotropic glutamate type 2 and 3 (mGlu2/3) receptors alleviates L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. To gain mechanistic insight into the anti-dyskinetic activity of mGlu2/3 activation, we performed autoradiographic binding with [3H]-LY-341,495 in brain sections from L-DOPA-treated 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats that developed mild or severe dyskinesia, as well as L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned and sham-lesioned animals. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, mildly dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats showed a decrease in [3H]-LY-341,495 binding in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, 30 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05), globus pallidus (GP, 28 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05; 23 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.001), and primary motor cortex (49 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05; 45 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.001). Severely dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited an increase in binding in the primary motor cortex (43 % vs mildly dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.05). In the contralateral hemisphere, mildly dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats harboured a decrease in binding in the EPN (30 % vs sham-lesioned rats; 24 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, both P<0.05), GP (34 % vs sham-lesioned rats, P<0.05; 23 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, P<0.001), and primary motor cortex (50 % vs sham-lesioned rats; 44 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, both P<0.05). Severely dyskinetic 6-OHDA-lesioned rats presented a decrease in binding in the GP (30 % vs sham-lesioned rats; 19 % vs L-DOPA-untreated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, both P<0.05). Abnormal involuntary movements scores of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals were positively correlated with [3H]-LY-341,495 binding in the ipsilateral striatum, ipsilateral EPN, ipsilateral primary motor cortex and contralateral primary motor cortex (all P<0.05). These results suggest that alterations in mGlu2/3 receptor levels may be part of an endogenous compensatory mechanism to alleviate dyskinesia.}

abstract = {Large-scale bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) could be realized without escalating biomass use - under the right conditions. We apply robust decision-making theory to frame carbon capture as a decision problem. We then search for conditions of low costs and energy penalties by modelling the capture decision across a million scenarios of already-existing plants in Sweden. Mining the scenario data reveals that annual plant utilization, heat recovery via heat pumps and electricity prices constitute key conditions for combined heat and power plants. For pulp mills, key conditions are site-specific, but the availability of low-pressure steam and electricity prices are generally important. A sensitivity analysis supports these findings, but also identifies capture rates as key. About 19 MtCO2 could be captured annually from the 113 plants studied while combusting zero additional biomass. Under the identified conditions, this would entail reduced power and district heating generation of 5.1-7.9 TWh per year – a modest penalty relative to the 220 TWh generated annually in Sweden.}

abstract = {Digital technologies are becoming a key force in reshaping the contemporary energy system and energy structure, however, the uncertainty of climate policies caused by climate change brings new challenges and opportunities for enterprises to transform digitally and enhance energy efficiency. Drawing on data from Chinese listed companies spanning 2010 to 2022, empirical findings demonstrate that enterprise digital technology (DT) effectively reduces energy consumption intensity (ECI). Moreover, climate policy uncertainty (CPU) acts as a catalyst, amplifying the energy-saving impact of DT while further advancing its application within enterprises. Mechanism analysis reveals that DT contributes to energy conservation by improving total factor productivity and innovation efficiency, expanding enterprise scale, promoting digital transformation, and reducing costs. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the energy-saving effect of DT is particularly pronounced in areas characterized by high levels of energy uncertainty, manufacturing sectors, and big data experimentation domains. This paper provides novel micro-level evidence for comprehensively understanding the interplay among CPU, adoption of DT, and ECI.}

The aim of the research was to explore the role of reference management software within scholarly workflows, alongside other ways of managing information including both digital and non-digital practices. An online survey consisting of both closed and open questions was completed by 263 respondents, comprising undergraduate students, taught postgraduates, postgraduate researchers, and academic staff at the university. Quantitative data was used to generate a descriptive overview of the research sample and to contextualise the interpretation of qualitative data. Qualitative data from the open questions was analysed using reflexive thematic analysis to generate the themes presented in this paper. Quantitative data revealed a wide range of both digital and non-digital methods for reference management. While most respondents had tried using at least one type of reference management software, use of software was higher among postgraduate researchers and academic staff than undergraduates and taught postgraduates. Three themes were generated from the qualitative data: practices are unique and contextual; practices develop over time; and reference management software forms part of wider practice. Exploration of these themes led to recommendations for librarians to incorporate this understanding of reference management practices into information literacy teaching.}

Further, we explore the spatial spillover effect and its moderating mechanism. Our results confirm a significant positive correlation between digital finance and energy transition efficiency. Moreover, digital finance is found to engender positive spatial spillover effects on energy transition in neighbouring cities. Finally, the analysis of the moderating effect reveals that digital economy policies can amplify the positive correlation between digital finance and energy transition.

Teaching was conducted primarily using a lecture-based format. The Therapeutic Revolution of the 1930s heralded an explosion in the number and types of therapies available. As therapy has evolved so has teaching. Didactic teaching has, in many cases, been replaced by active learning and the health professions curriculum has shifted from an instructor-centered and discipline-based to a learner-centered, competence-based model. Pharmacology as a stand-alone discipline has largely been integrated into systems based or other modes of teaching. Assessments have also evolved from traditional examination formats that emphasized rote knowledge memorization to other assessment formats such as objective structured clinical examinations that emphasize evaluation of skills and attitudes. It has been challenging to define the best modalities given the wide variances in health professions education and the structure of health care systems internationally. Nonetheless, International collaboration efforts have been crucial to define core competencies which can then be used to guide curricular development. Challenges facing educators also include teaching ethical conduct of prescribing and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used in both teaching and evaluation, suggesting the need for on-going dialogue, continuing professional development and research in these important areas.}

We contribute to extant understanding of digital content marketing research in a B2B context by demonstrating that there are no universally correct sequences for presenting content to customers at different stages of the customer journey in order to systematically increase engagement. Instead, the findings suggest that the types of content customers prefer to see in different journey stages varies between individuals.

This study introduces a flexible simulation model combining discrete event and agent-based elements to estimate the long-term demand and supply of reconditioned electric vehicle batteries up to 2050. The model considers economic and regulatory factors, integrating the interests of key stakeholders, including original equipment manufacturers, recyclers, reconditioners, and consumers. A German case study demonstrates the viability of reconditioning, highlighting its niche role compared to recycling and repurposing. Key findings reveal that original equipment manufacturer decisions, particularly the use of reconditioned batteries in warranty cases, significantly influence market dynamics. Consumers' demand for reconditioned batteries depends on their quality, price, and greenhouse gas savings compared to new batteries. The study also examines the impacts of the EU Battery Regulation's recycled content mandates. The results underline the importance of aligning stakeholder strategies and regulatory frameworks to optimize end-of-life battery management. Promoting reconditioning can enhance circular economy practices while reducing environmental impacts, though challenges remain in aligning supply with demand and ensuring economic feasibility.}

In light of the significance of integrating social and emotional learning into school instruction, this study utilized a service-learning approach to facilitate this integration. The objective was to estimate the impact of a service-learning program based on social and emotional learning on the levels of social and emotional competencies and the prevention of internet gaming disorder among Spanish adolescents. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design, with the sample divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 54) and the control group (n = 54). The intervention group implemented a service-learning program on prevention measures against internet gaming addiction at their high school, receiving training in social and emotional competencies at the same time. The results indicate that the intervention group obtained a statistically significant improvement in social and emotional competencies and symptoms related to internet gaming disorder in comparison to the control group following the completion of the program. The obtained effect size indicates a large impact of the program. The present study proposes an innovative intervention that integrates service-learning and social and emotional learning to prevent video game addiction problems in high school students.
Resumen
El aumento sustancial en la prevalencia del trastorno por juego en internet en adolescentes ha generado un incremento en las investigaciones que se han desarrollado para determinar sus factores protectores, entre los que destacan las competencias sociales y emocionales. Sin embargo, la investigación sobre la efectividad del aprendizaje social y emocional para prevenir el trastorno por juego en internet es limitada. Dada la importancia de integrar el aprendizaje social y emocional en la instrucción escolar, este estudio ha utilizado el aprendizaje-servicio para facilitar esta integración. El objetivo ha sido determinar el impacto de un programa de aprendizaje-servicio basado en el aprendizaje social y emocional sobre las competencias sociales y emocionales y la prevención del trastorno por juego en internet en adolescentes españoles. El estudio ha adoptado un diseño cuasiexperimental, con la muestra dividida en dos: el grupo de intervención (n = 54) y el grupo de control (n = 54). El grupo de intervención ha implementado un programa de aprendizaje-servicio sobre medidas de prevención de la adicción a los videojuegos en su centro educativo, recibiendo simultáneamente entrenamiento en competencias sociales y emocionales. Los resultados indican que el grupo de intervención ha mejorado sus competencias sociales y emocionales y síntomas relacionados con el trastorno por videojuegos en comparación con el grupo de control. El tamaño del efecto obtenido indica un gran impacto del programa. Este estudio propone una intervención innovadora que integra el aprendizaje-servicio y el aprendizaje social y emocional para prevenir los problemas de adicción a los videojuegos en adolescentes.}

Recently, using image data and deep learning to investigate the interactions between humans and urban infrastructure has been a popular approach since the fast development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the convergence of data fusion, deep learning, and human-urban infrastructure interaction studies remains underexplored. Here we systematically analyze 3,552 papers from 2013 to 2023 that use image data to investigate the intersection area of data fusion, deep learning, and human and urban infrastructure interactions, aiming to elucidate the relationships among these three key elements. We found that the cross-applications of deep learning in the papers reviewed are not standardized. Given the trend of diversified data fusion, data fusion about real-world dynamic interactions is scarce. Lastly, four potential future research directions are identified: (1) understanding the dynamic and complex interaction processes; (2) exploring the potential and standards for the application of deep learning; (3) focusing more on research concerning cities in the Global South; (4) establishing suitable training datasets for the interaction between urban infrastructures and humans, which may provide valuable insights for applying foundation models in future urban studies.}

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are vital therapeutic tools to counteract both pandemic and seasonal influenza threats. Traditional strategies for optimizing nAbs generally rely on labor-intensive, high-throughput mutagenesis screens. Here, we present an innovative structure-based design framework for the optimization of nAbs, which integrates epitope-paratope analysis, computational modeling, and rational design approaches, complemented by comprehensive experimental assessment. This approach was applied to optimize MEDI8852, a nAb targeting the stalk region of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA). The resulting variant, M18.1.2.2, shows a marked enhancement in both affinity and neutralizing efficacy, as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Computational modeling reveals that this improvement can be attributed to the fine-tuning of interactions between the antibody’s side-chains and the epitope residues that are highly conserved across the influenza A virus HA stalk. Our dry-wet iterative protocol for nAb optimization presented here yielded a promising candidate for influenza intervention.}

This can easily lead to poor decision-making, resulting in the designs that do not meet the user’s preferences. Therefore, this paper proposed an expert decision support system for product bionic design that integrates emotional preferences and image generation to support designers in the Biologically Inspired Design (BID) process. This paper took the electric kettle as a case study. First, the biological features are matched with the product semantics to propose the bionic conversion factor. Users’ emotional preferences are analyzed to build a correlation model with the bionic conversion factors, thereby calculating product preference data. Second, the raw biometric data is calculated based on the bionic conversion factors. An intuitive fuzzy number emotional scale is used to measure users’ preferences for these bionic features. A linear function model is constructed between user preferences and the bionic conversion factors to calculate biological preference data. By fitting the product preference data, bionic creatures that align with user preferences are selected. Finally, eye-tracking experiments are conducted to identify the critical biological features. StyleGAN is then applied to integrate these features with product images, resulting in a conceptual solution that serves as a reference for designers. Based on the analysis of users concerned emotional needs, the designer optimizes the details of the concept design to create the final product scheme. User evaluation of the design outputs shows that the electric kettle designed by the proposed system has the highest score and meets the user’s expectations, which verifies the effectiveness and scientificity.}

abstract = {Model-based virtual sensing offers a viable approach for monitoring fatigue loads on operational offshore wind turbines. These methods combine response measurements with first-principle, or data-informed models, to estimate load time series at hard-to-access locations. However, their accuracy depends on the fidelity of the underlying model, which is largely influenced by uncertainties in the soil–structure interaction (SSI) models. This study evaluates the impact of different SSI modelling approaches in terms of a virtual sensing validation study targeting strain estimation above and below the mudline of a bottom-founded offshore wind turbine. To this end, different numerical models derived from, and validated against, design documentation serve as input to a dual-band modal decomposition and expansion (MDE) method. The considered SSI models range from an API/DNV-based foundation model to a PISA-based model including scour protection. Virtual sensing results are generated for two-year equivalent datasets, obtained for three operational offshore wind turbines, each equipped with extensive load monitoring systems. One turbine is used to assess the effect of the model updates, while two additional turbines are used to assess the across-site consistency. The estimated strains are directly compared against available strain validation data, in terms of damage-equivalent stress, and are accumulated to give a single comparative metric representative for the two-year periods. Results show that PISA-based soil reaction curves significantly improve agreement with measured strains while adding a scour protection model has a relatively smaller impact. These findings highlight the importance of accurate foundation modelling in virtual sensing and demonstrate the feasibility of fatigue monitoring at hard-to-access locations.}

Asarum heterotropoides F. Schmidt (ARR) has a well-documented history of traditional use in East Asia for musculoskeletal pain disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA), attributed to its significant anti-inflammatory properties. While preliminary studies suggest potential anti-inflammatory effects, conclusive evidence regarding the ability of ARRs to modulate the multiple inflammatory pathologies involved in OA pathogenesis is currently lacking.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to experimentally evaluate the effects of ARR extract on pain, cartilage integrity, and inflammatory responses using in vitro and in vivo models relevant to OA, guided by initial computational predictions.
Materials and methods
Active ingredients of ARRs were retrieved from four databases and screened using SwissADME for ADME predictions. Disease targets were combined with OA-related genes from GEO microarray database. The intersecting genes underwent protein-protein interaction construction, GO, and KEGG enrichment analysis. A compound-target-pathway network was constructed using Cytoscape and was validated via molecular docking. Pain-relieving, functional, and chondroprotective effects were assessed in vivo using acetic acid-induced peripheral pain mice and monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis rat models. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory properties were explored by evaluating serum cartilage tissue and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.
Results
Network pharmacology analysis elucidated five principal active constituents of ARR (cryptopine, 5-[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-2,3-dimethoxy-phenol, 5-[2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-2-methoxybenzene-1,3-diol, naringenin, resorstatin) alongside 22 putative herbal targets. Molecular docking analyses revealed strong binding affinities (−8 to −9.4 kcal/mol) of these constituents towards principal target proteins. Functional GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that ARR exerts its effects potentially involving pathways associated with cancer, fluid shear stress, and atherosclerosis. In vivo assessments demonstrated significant mitigation of pain, functional deficits, and cartilage degradation by ARR within an MIA-induced osteoarthritis model. Molecular dynamics simulations validated stable interactions between the primary compounds and their designated target proteins. The therapeutic efficacy of ARR was characterized by dose-dependent suppression of diverse inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -3, -8, -13), and signaling pathways including CCND1, CDK2, IKBKB, HIF1A, BDKRB1, SIRT1, MAPK8, and NLRP3 within both RAW264.7 cells and articular cartilage tissue.
Conclusions
This investigation demonstrates that ARR exerts pain alleviation, functional enhancement, and chondroprotective effects in osteoarthritis via multi-target anti-inflammatory actions. Integrating network pharmacology, molecular docking, animal models, and cellular experiments, this study comprehensively elucidated the multifaceted anti-inflammatory mechanisms attributed to ARR. These findings collectively provide a crucial foundation for understanding the potential therapeutic efficacy and operative mechanisms of ARR for osteoarthritis management.}

However, as generative AI tools based on large language models, such as ChatGPT, become increasingly sophisticated, it may be possible to replace or augment tedious, manual work with semi-automated approaches.

This study introduces an experimental framework to simulate partial dam-break waves triggered by partial gate openings. We conducted numerous experiments to explore how different factors, including water-level differences (hi), reservoir widths (L), dam-break openings (e), and submerged depths (hw) influence the characteristic heights of the main-wave peak (h1c), subwave peak (h2c), and main-wave trough (h1t). Our analysis led to the development of an equation for predicting h1c. Furthermore, we compared the partial dam-break wave profile with the theoretical profile of a solitary wave, identifying optimal conditions for solitary wave generation and examining the velocity characteristics of partial dam-break waves. The results reveal that: (1) h1c, h2c, and h1t have positive correlations with hi and L, but negative correlations with e and hw; (2) notably, the main-wave pre-peak profile aligns more closely with the solitary wave theory; and (3) the solitary wave theory accurately predicts the main-wave peak velocity. This study enhances our understanding of wave characteristic evolution during partial dam-breaks and can be used for validation in numerical simulations.}

DDS was developed to enable targeted and controlled delivery of methotrexate to cancer cells. The DDS pores were utilized for loading methotrexate through multilayer physical adsorption, which occurred spontaneously and exothermically. The methotrexate adsorption capacity of the DDS was 673.001 ± 4.518 mg/g. The copolymer acted as a gatekeeper, regulating the entry and exit of methotrexate from the pores. The DDS exhibited minimal methotrexate leakage at high pH levels but showed a significantly increased release at lower pH levels, demonstrating a pH-controlled drug release pattern. Mathematical modeling indicated that diffusion played a major role in drug release, and the DDS functioned as a reservoir system with a declining release rate over time. Importantly, the DDS displayed significant cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by MTT assays. Furthermore, the methotrexate-loaded DDS showed remarkable efficacy in killing MCF-7 cells, suggesting that folic acid facilitates DDS-specific targeting of MCF-7 cells via folic acid receptors.}

This review aims to provide an overview of novel diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals tested recently or used currently in genitourinary cancers within prospective phase 1–2 clinical trials, summarizing progresses and future directions.
Methods
A systematic search was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for original prospective research studies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines.
Key findings and limitations
Forty-six papers were systematically reviewed; 74 ongoing clinical trials were identified. The results of 27 novel radiopharmaceuticals (ie, not approved by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency and not listed in the Pharmacopeia) prospectively investigated in genitourinary cancers, mostly prostate, for diagnostic, theranostic, or therapeutic purposes (21, one, and five of the 27 radiopharmaceuticals, respectively) over the past 5 yr were presented. Most were prostate-specific membrane antigen–targeting agents (17/27); other targets included gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, carbonic anhydrase IX, Cu, six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1, tumor-associated glycoprotein 42, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Ongoing research confirms the same trend. Fibroblast activation protein inhibitor, PD-L1, CD8, nectin-4, and HER2 are other targets under investigation. Among the 22 ongoing therapeutic trials (out of the 74 ongoing clinical trials), targeted alpha therapy is being explored in 12, and five are evaluating combinations of radioligand therapy with other treatments. We confirmed the safety of radiopharmaceuticals (regardless of the diagnostic/therapeutic purpose) and showed promising results in terms of diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy in genitourinary cancers.
Conclusions and clinical implications
There continues to be expansion in radiopharmaceutical approaches to genitourinary cancers, reflecting a strong emphasis on improving tumor detection and treatment, which will likely impact future management across the disease spectrum, with the potential for improved patient care and outcomes.}

Our proposal categorises the algorithms based on their role in the game environment, which can either be game control or user assessment. Game control algorithms adapt the game environment and difficulty, while user assessment algorithms gather information about the player's state, such as performance, mood, or physiological data, to evaluate the treatment progress. The review also examines the growing trend of using multimodal data as input for machine learning models. Results show that a few well-known algorithms, such as Decision Trees (DT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are frequently used. However, there is a clear distinction in their purposes: while FL is typically applied to game control tasks, SVMs are mainly used for user assessment. This review offers valuable insights for researchers in the field, providing a comprehensive overview of the suitability of different AI algorithms for various tasks in SGs, with a particular focus on personalisation and motivation.}

We analysed screen recordings of evolving revision behaviours, changes in text quality as well as joint discussions among pairs. Complementing Strobl, Menke-Bazhutkina, Abel, and Michel (2024), the current paper (i) relates writers’ revision behaviour to text quality evaluated for functional adequacy (Kuiken & Vedder, 2017); and (ii) presents a fine-grained review of dialogues to identify patterns of CW revisions in interaction with GenAI models. Findings shed new light on CW models (Storch, 2009) in the digital era where GenAI is implemented in L2 writing and revision instruction.}

The phenotypic information comprised 5529 records from 1703 naturally infected animals. After genomic data quality control, 37,511 SNPs from 589 animals were available. The weighted single-step approach for genome-wide association study was performed to estimate the SNP effects and variances accounted by 10–SNP sliding windows. Confirming the polygenic nature of the studied traits, 20, 22, 21, and 19 genomic windows that explained more than 0.5% of the additive genetic variance were identified for fecal egg counts (FEC), Famacha© (FAM), packed cell volume (PCV), and total plasma protein (TPP), respectively. A total of 81, 122, 106, and 101 protein-coding genes were found in windows associated with FEC, FAM, PCV, and TPP, respectively. Several protein‐coding genes related to the immune system and inflammatory response functions were identified within those genomic regions, such as ADCY9, ADRB2, BRAF, CADM1, CCL20, CD70, CREBBP, FNBP1, HTR4, IL16, IL22, IL26, MAPK8, NDFIP1, NLRC3, PAK5, PLCB1, PLCB4, ROCK1, TEK, TNFRSF12A, and VAV1. Functional enrichment analysis by DAVID tool also revealed many significant (P < 0.05) pathways and Gene Ontology terms that could be related to resistance to gastrointestinal nematode in Santa Ines sheep, such as chemokine signaling pathway (oas04062), cAMP signaling pathway (oas04024), cGMP-PKG signaling pathway (Oas04022), platelet activation (Oas04611), Rap1 signaling pathway (oas04015), and oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen (GO:0016705).

abstract = {Childhood exposure to social adversity – including experiences such as poverty, discrimination, violence, family separation, household dysfunction, and maltreatment – is associated with cardiometabolic health problems across the life course. A key question in the field is whether the timing of social adversity matters. To better understand the developmental origins of cardiometabolic disease and the emergence of health disparities, we conducted a systematic review of human observational studies to synthesize the evidence for sensitive periods to social adversity in immune and metabolic development. To be included in the study, some form of social adversity had to be independently reported at two or more non-overlapping time points during the prenatal period or childhood (<21 years old) and studies were required to include an outcome relevant to immune and/or metabolic biomarkers measured at some time after the social adversity exposure. Of the 2440 unique records screened, 25 met criteria for inclusion. Twenty studies investigated sensitive periods in immune development and six in metabolic development. For immune development, studies identified sensitive periods to social adversity inconsistently from the prenatal period through age 18. However, the proportion of studies confirming sensitive periods was highest at the youngest stages of development and gradually decreased across the life course. 50 % of studies found significant sensitive period effects in the prenatal period, while only 20 % found significant effects in late adolescence. For metabolic development, studies identified sensitive periods more consistently from birth through age 12. The proportion of studies reporting sensitive periods peaked at 50 % in infancy and decreased to zero after preadolescence. Overall, we found insufficient evidence to identify precise periods during which specific social adversity exposures have been consistently associated with altered immune and metabolic development. More birth cohorts with repeated measures of both social exposures and immune and metabolic biomarkers are needed, as are studies leveraging causal inference methods to more robustly account for time-varying confounding. However, these limitations notwithstanding, our review finds evidence that early experiences matter for immune and metabolic functioning. Improving the social and economic circumstances of young children may benefit lifelong cardiometabolic health.}

Thus, two biostimulants, soil bioremediation nutrients (SBNs) and nutrient solution (NS), were tested to assess their effects on the degradation of PHCs and changes in bacterial community compositions, functions and functional genes using third generation sequencing, Tax4Fun2 and qPCR at the field scale. The addition of SBNs or NS significantly increased and accelerated the degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The highest TPH degradation rate (96%) and k (0.134/day) were shown for biopiles with SBNs addition (particularly for 0.5% SBNs), indicating that SBNs were a good biostimulant for bioremediation of PHC-contaminated soil in the field. After different operations, rapid reconstruction of bacterial communities and functions for 5 biopiles was found with relatively high metabolic function and a change in dominant PHC degraders from Rugosibacter aromaticivorans and Novosphingobium aromaticivorans to Immundisolibacter cernigliae and Dyella ginsengisoli. The results of Tax4Fun2 prediction revealed that the addition of SBNs and water with soil turning enhanced and accelerated bacterial metabolic functions and related functional genes for degrading aromatic compounds. The qPCR results indicated that most samples contained a relatively high abundance of alkB, alkB1, XylE and PHE, and high expression of XylE and PHE, while the addition of SBNs and NS enhanced the expression of XylE and PHE for degrading catechol and phenol. Concentrations of TPH and nutrients were major environmental factors influencing the degradation of TPH, alkane and aromatic compounds and changes in bacterial communities, functions and functional genes (e.g., alkB, alkB1, XylE, NAH, PHE and BPH4). Biostimulation by the addition of SBNs proved an effective strategy for increasing the degradation of PHCs and facilitating the growth and metabolic activity of PHC degraders.}

This study proposes a novel method to evaluate the demand flexibility of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings based on real-world data. To reflect the thermal dynamic response of HVAC systems, a data-driven model utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN) with online learning is developed, enhancing modeling accuracy using historical operation data. Considering the replicated ANN model, the optimal Demand Response (DR) schedules in response to Time-Of-Use (TOU) prices from the grid operator are determined to minimize building electricity costs. Consequently, the flexibility quantification of HVAC systems is evaluated by comparing the derived optimal DR schedules with baseline consumption. Case studies simulated using real-world data from South Korea demonstrate that the demand flexibility of HVAC systems can effectively provide overall grid flexibility, even when solely responding to commonly used TOU prices. The proposed flexibility evaluation method is valuable for grid operators in managing grid problems that arise from the increasing integration of RESs and rising electricity demand, from a stable network operation perspective.}

Many studies use concept maps, a visualized tool, to aid in this process. It is crucial to look into the ways that groups of three or more people construct knowledge and to combine implicit physiological data with explicit data. In this study, we combined content analysis, ordered network analysis (ONA), and hyperscanning technology based on electroencephalograms (EEG) to analyze the data of 28 triads of high- and low-achievement groups that participated in collaborative concept mapping tasks. The frequency statistics showed that the low-achievement groups have significantly higher monitoring and adapting behavior frequencies at the individual level in the regulation dimension than the high-achievement groups. The ONA results further illustrated the sequence of knowledge transfer based on the frequency analysis. The cognitive patterns of high-achievement groups showed a cycle that began at the group level of cognition, moved to the peer level of cognition, then to the group level of regulation, and ultimately returned to the group level of cognition. The low-achievement groups' cognitive patterns also exhibited directionality, moving from the group level of regulation to the individual level of cognition and to the group level of cognition. From the implicit perspective, the theta band and temporal-parietal regions showed greater inter-brain synchrony in the high-achievement groups. Low-achievement groups, on the other hand, had comparatively lower synchrony. Their consensus was only superficial and concentrated on ensuring that everyone participated through regulation and thought integration to finish the task. Our study's findings can help teachers and instructional designers develop tailored interventions based on differences in learners' cognitive patterns during collaborative concept mapping tasks.}

A crucial step in this process is mapping data elements to ontological concepts, which typically involves substantial manual effort. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in automating complex language-related tasks and may offer a solution to streamline biological data annotation. This study investigates the utility of LLMs—specifically various base and fine-tuned GPT models—for the automatic assignment of ontological identifiers to biological sample labels. We evaluated model performance in annotating labels to four widely used ontologies: the Cell Line Ontology (CLO), Cell Ontology (CL), Uber-anatomy Ontology (UBERON), and BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO). Our dataset was compiled from publicly available, high-quality databases containing biologically relevant sequence information, which suffers from inconsistent annotation practices, complicating integrative analyses. Model outputs were compared against annotations generated by text2term, a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The fine-tuned GPT model outperformed both the base models and text2term in annotating cell lines and cell types, particularly for the CL and UBERON ontologies, achieving a precision of 47–64% and a recall of 88–97%. In contrast, base models exhibited significantly lower performance. These results suggest that fine-tuned LLMs can accelerate and improve the accuracy of biological data annotation. Nonetheless, our evaluation highlights persistent challenges, including variable precision across ontology categories and the continued need for expert curation to ensure annotation validity.}

The digital transformation of health care has introduced both opportunities and challenges, particularly in managing and analyzing the vast amounts of unstructured medical data generated daily. There is a need to explore the feasibility of generative solutions in extracting data from medical reports, categorized by specific criteria.
Objective
This study aimed to investigate the application of large language models (LLMs) for the automated extraction of structured information from unstructured medical reports, using the LangChain framework in Python.
Methods
Through a systematic evaluation of leading LLMs—GPT-4o, Llama 3, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Qwen 2, and Qwen 2.5—using zero-shot prompting techniques and embedding results into a vector database, this study assessed the performance of LLMs in extracting patient demographics, diagnostic details, and pharmacological data.
Results
Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, revealed high efficacy across most categories, with GPT-4o achieving the highest overall performance (91.4% accuracy).
Conclusions
The findings highlight notable differences in precision and recall between models, particularly in extracting names and age-related information. There were challenges in processing unstructured medical text, including variability in model performance across data types. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating LLMs into health care workflows; LLMs offer substantial improvements in data accessibility and support clinical decision-making processes. In addition, the paper describes the role of retrieval-augmented generation techniques in enhancing information retrieval accuracy, addressing issues such as hallucinations and outdated data in LLM outputs. Future work should explore the need for optimization through larger and more diverse training datasets, advanced prompting strategies, and the integration of domain-specific knowledge to improve model generalizability and precision.}

The growing clinical success of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) has led to rapid interest in leveraging dual targeting in order to generate novel modes of therapeutic action beyond mono-targeting approaches. While bsAbs that bind targets on two different cells (trans-targeting) are showing promise in the clinic, the co-targeting of two proteins on the same cell surface through cis-targeting bsAbs (cis-bsAbs) is an emerging strategy to elicit new functionalities. This includes the ability to induce proximity, enhance binding to a target, increase target/cell selectivity, and/or co-modulate function on the cell surface with the goal of altering, reversing, or eradicating abnormal cellular activity that contributes to disease. In this review, we focus on the impact of cis-bsAbs in the clinic, their emerging applications, and untangle the intricacies of improving bsAb discovery and development.}

abstract = {During the world’s first nuclear explosion, in 1945, glassy melts called “trinitites”, mostly derived from the sands at the surface of the test site, formed and were deposited at or near the hypocenter. The processes of formation of this fallout remain unclear. Here, we show how the oxygen and silicon isotopic compositions of three trinitites allow to refine their formation scenario. The three samples are typical of trinitites, being composed of various crystalline phases and of glassy phases divided into three chemical groups (CaMgFe, alkali, silica) that are mixed in various proportions in the three samples. The three samples show a large range of oxygen and silicon isotopic variations (−10.9 ± 0.6 < δ30Si < 4.2 ± 0.6 ‰, and 2.3 ± 0.4 < δ18O < 24.2 ± 0.5 ‰). At variance with the Hiroshima fallout deposits, no oxygen mass-independent isotopic fractionation was found in the three trinitites. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the chemical groups reveal that they result from different processes: the silica phases are molten fragments of the site material, while the CaMgFe and alkali phases are produced by the mixing of condensates and molten site material. Models show that the observed silicon isotopic variations resulted from Rayleigh distillation during condensation of the gaseous species injected into the cloud, while the variability in composition of the site materials also played an important role for controlling the oxygen isotopic compositions. From these observations, a general scenario, beginning with the vaporization of the site surface, producing a depression, is proposed. The vaporized material condensed and grew by agglomeration with other condensates and liquid materials. These agglomerates rained on the surface and quenched, forming the trinitites. This scenario is different from the formation of the Hiroshima glasses but shows some similarities to tektite formation.}

Many models of fish growth assume that the fish population in a habitat is homogenous, meaning that there is no physiological spectrum and, therefore, no size spectrum. Moreover, models that account for the size spectrum are not always analytically tractable. We present novel mathematical models of fish growth in which the body weight of each fish is assumed to follow a von Bertalanffy-type model whose proportionality coefficient, representing the maximum body weight, may differ among individual fish. This probabilistic description introduces the size spectrum into the model, owing to which the time-dependent probability density of this model is obtained explicitly. We also consider a misspecified version and a stochastic version of the model as advanced cases. We apply the first model to the real growth data of Plecoglossus altivelis as a keystone fish species in Japan. The model successfully reproduces the skewed size spectrum of this fish species over multiple years. We further use the stochastic model to investigate how fish growth dynamics are affected by environmental fluctuations.}

This demonstrates how regional settings and national policies have a significant impact on MIL research, as do differences in terminology usage and conceptual understanding. However, aspects of PTs’ MIL that support teaching practices remain underexplored in the existing literature, indicating a critical gap in preparing PTs for their roles as educators. Concerns regarding the credibility of results are further raised by the extensive use of self-reported assessments. Furthermore, because they have a big impact on PTs' MIL abilities, demographic factors including gender and regional discrepancies need constant monitoring. The findings highlight the need to integrate MIL into teacher education to enhance teaching competencies and address regional and demographic disparities, ensuring preservice teachers are equipped for modern educational demands.}

abstract = {By combining the capabilities of Moonshot and DeepSeek-R1, which respectively evaluate risk scores based on MD&A text information and financial data, we exploit the complementary strengths of long-context and reasoning large language models (LLMs) to help evaluate material misstatement risks in audit opinions. Our results suggest that both MD&A-based and financial-based risk evaluations effectively distinguish qualified and unqualified audit opinions, but combining them yields the best performance. In addition to the interpretative analysis text output, the combined LLM evaluation consistently outperforms logistic regression prediction that incorporates all indicators, and it achieves comparable performance compared to the sophisticated machine learning methods like gradient boosting regression and random forests. Further analysis reveals that LLMs excel in high-risk scenarios: in firms with 1) high financial constraints, 2) low internal controls, 3) low audit quality, 4) low readability, or 5) negative tone of MD&A texts. A topic model analysis has shown clear difference in the MD&A emphasis for firms the qualified and unqualified opinions given by our framework. These findings shed light on the potential role of the collaborative LLM agent framework as a tool to help auditors and investors detect financial fraud.}

However, limitations associated with comprehensively constructing and expressing highly complex venom and venom-like molecule libraries have precluded their therapeutic evaluation via high-throughput screening. Here, we developed an innovative computational approach to design a highly diverse library of animal venoms and “metavenoms”. We used programmable M13 hyperphage display to preserve critical disulfide-bonded structures for highly parallelized single-round biopanning with quantitation via high-throughput DNA sequencing. Our approach led to the discovery of Kunitz-type domain containing proteins that target the human itch receptor Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X4, which plays a crucial role in itch perception. Deep learning-based structural homology mining identified two endogenous human homologs, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and serine peptidase inhibitor, Kunitz type 2 (SPINT2), which exhibit agonist-dependent potentiation of Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X4. Highly multiplexed screening of animal venoms and metavenoms is therefore a promising approach to uncover new drug candidates.}

abstract = {Background
Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignancy characterized by the absence of reliable prognostic indicators and effective therapeutic targets. Claudin-9 (CLDN9) has been demonstrated to be upregulated in various cancers. However, its prognostic value, biological function, and regulatory mechanisms in GC remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the role of CLDN9 in GC progression and its underlying mechanisms.
Methods
We utilized consensus cluster, random survival forest, and multivariate Cox regression analyses to identify CLDN9 in GC. Subsequently, we evaluated the mRNA and protein levels of CLDN9 in GC using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR), Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, the role of CLDN9 in GC progression was investigated using a series of functional in vivo and in vitro experiments. Finally, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of CLDN9 using bioinformatics, molecular biology, animal models, and patient tissue specimens.
Results
Two GC subtypes with survival and functional differences were identified based on glycolytic metabolic genes in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)- Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) dataset. A prognostic risk score was calculated using seven genes to assess the overall survival (OS) in GC. Using random survival forest and multivariate Cox analyses, we identified CLDN9 as the key gene linked to the glycolytic subtype and prognosis of GC. CLDN9 expression was significantly upregulated in patients with GC as well as in GC cells. CLDN9 knockdown inhibited tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CLDN9 was found to regulate lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression and promote glycolytic metabolism by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) signaling pathway. Additionally, lactate, a glycolytic metabolite, enhanced programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) lactylation and stability, which suppressed anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells, thereby contributing to GC progression.
Conclusions
CLDN9 expression is associated with GC development and progression. Mechanistically, CLDN9 enhances the glycolysis pathway and facilitates PD-L1 lactylation through the PI3K/AKT/HIF1α signaling pathway, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity in CD8+ T cells. CLDN9 has the potential to serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.}

Termed as the nuclear paradox, this dual framing of nuclear energy often oscillates between promise and peril depending on which aspect of its duality appears more immediate, leaving society to navigate the difficult trade-offs. This study re-examines the structural shortcomings of the first nuclear era and outlines the conditions necessary for a more resilient second phase of nuclear development in the context of today's evolving energy market. It argues that the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR), through its distinctive reactor design and fuel cycle, offers a comprehensive response to long-standing concerns about safety, economic viability, proliferation, and waste permanence—exemplified by the ill-fated concept of the Atomic Priesthood. The analysis concludes with concrete policy recommendations to accelerate LFTR research and implementation, contributing to the realization of a more secure and sustainable nuclear energy future.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel Deep Learning (DL) framework for cotton plant disease prediction based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Copula entropy based-Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. The suggested framework uses a cotton plant image as input and pre-processes it to produce an image with enhanced contrast. Features are extracted from the leaf images with the ResNet50 CNN model. A crucial pre-processing model known as feature selection helps to improve the effectiveness of image classification by deleting extraneous or irrelevant features. Therefore, the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm which is a global search method with potential use in feature selection is employed in this paper. The proposed framework introduces Copula entropy (CE) as an indicator of association to create the GWO’s initial population and enhance the GWO feature engineering process. For the GWO initialization procedure, CE has been used to choose the most significant features which substantially improved the quality of the GWO starting population and as a result improved the performance of the proposed CE-based GWO algorithm by 78.57 % faster than the traditional GWO as stated by the time complexity analysis. In addition, Feature importance explanation is determined using XAI layer. The final classification is achieved using Random Forests (RF) classifier which is an ensemble learning approach. According to the experimental results, the suggested model has a classification accuracy of 99 % and a mean squared error of 0.0383. Furthermore, the proposed model has been compared to state-of-the-art algorithms and the results showed that the proposed model has the superiority performance. The proposed model can therefore be used to track a variety of cotton areas to enable faster analysis and response, resulting in higher productivity.}

Conversely, pure machine learning (ML) models offer both computational efficiency and accuracy but often lack interpretability. To address this gap, we propose SGUnet, a physics-informed ML model and a hybrid theory-guided data science approach, for rapid, high-resolution flood mapping. It utilizes a neural network with U-Net architecture and integrates subgrid-based coarse-grid hydrodynamic model predictions as initial estimates, upskilling them to achieve fine-grid model accuracy. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic models, the subgrid method embeds fine-scale topographic details within coarse-grid cells, enhancing both computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. SGUnet processes flood depth raster patches (512 × 512 pixels) and corresponding digital elevation models as inputs. It functions as a deep learning-based corrector, refining flood predictions from numerical simulators. Trained through supervised learning, SGUnet learns to correct deviations in coarse-grid predictions using fine-grid model outputs as target values. The model is evaluated across three large Australian watersheds—Wollombi, Chowilla, and Burnett River—using HEC-RAS flood simulations with subgrid formulation. SGUnet reduces root mean squared error by a factor of 4.5–5.3 compared to coarse-grid models, achieves a critical success index exceeding 0.9 for flood extent mapping, and delivers a 50x speed-up over fine-grid hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, SGUnet outperforms a state-of-the-art ML-based upskilling model in depth and extent predictions. By effectively correcting flood artifacts from coarse-grid models, SGUnet achieves near fine-grid accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, demonstrating its potential for real-time flood risk assessment.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) models struggle to reach performance levels due to the complex nature of Arabic grammar and diverse regional dialects. This study investigated how generative AI (GenAI) functions as a teaching assistant in Arabic language classrooms. Using qualitative methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 instructors; the data was then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results revealed that instructors used GenAI to create material, assess students’ work, and create personalized learning plans. Instructors struggled, however, with AI accuracy in dialect processing, cultural authenticity, and ensuring accurate assessment methods. The analysis raised significant gaps in teacher training, assessment strategies, and institutional guidelines. Instructors found it challenging to evaluate AI-generated Arabic content across different dialects and maintain academic integrity in student assignments. This study recommends developing instructor training, specifically on using GenAI tools for Arabic dialect variations and creating culturally appropriate Arabic language learning materials.}

These perturbations can significantly degrade model performance and introduce multifaceted societal risks. To verify the safe robustness of VLMs and further inspire the design of defensive AI frameworks, we propose Virtual Scenario Hypnosis (VSH), a multimodal prompt injection jailbreak method that embeds malicious queries into prompts through a deceptive narrative framework. This approach strategically distracts the model while compromising its resistance to jailbreak attempts. Our methodology features two key innovations: 1) Targeted adversarial image prompts that transform textual content into visual layouts through optimized typographic designs, circumventing safety alignment mechanisms to elicit harmful responses; and 2) An information veil encrypted In-Context Learning (ICL) method for text prompts that systematically evades safety detection protocols. To streamline evaluation, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate an efficient assessment of jailbreak success rates, supported by a meticulously designed prompt template incorporating multi-dimensional scoring rules and evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of VSH, achieving an overall success rate exceeding 82% on 500 harmful queries spanning multiple domains when tested against LLaVA-v1.5-13B and GPT-4o mini.}

The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students’ intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages.

The isolated EJ-ELNs demonstrated excellent colloidal stability, maintaining structural integrity under simulated gastrointestinal fluid, enzymatic degradation (DNase, RNase, Proteinase K) and acidic conditions (pH 2), and diverse storage conditions (25 °C, 4 °C, −80 °C, and lyophilization). In vitro, EJ-ELNs promoted dendritic cell (DC) maturation by upregulating surface molecules and enhancing the secretion of Th1-polarizing cytokine, while suppressing antigen uptake via MAPK and NF-κB pathways. These activated DCs facilitated the differentiation of naïve T cells into IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells and promoted the activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. In vivo, oral administration of EJ-ELNs restored DC function and expanded polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells co-expressing CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, ultimately leading to significant tumor suppression. Lipidomic and metabolomic profiling identified ceramide, Hex1Cer, naringenin, and genistein as key immunostimulatory constituents.

abstract = {Background
Many Korean American older adults have limited English proficiency, have low socioeconomic status, and are immigrants. The availability and accessibility of linguistic and culturally appropriate dementia-related health care and caregiving resources for this population are limited. This is concerning given that Korean American older adults are a rapidly growing population, and Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a significant public health issue.
Objective
We aimed to assess changes in pre- and posttest knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding ADRD prevention and caregiving among participants in the Koreans Invested in Making Caregivers’ Health Important (KIMCHI) before and after their participation in KIMCHI workshop presentations.
Methods
A community engagement dissemination project, KIMCHI, was developed by academic and community partners to culturally and linguistically tailor selected evidence-based research from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute for Korean American older adults, caregivers, and other stakeholders. Dissemination activities were conducted in-person (as workshops) and on digital platforms. Through partnerships with 1 academic institution and 2 community organizations that serve Korean Americans, 211 participants participated in the KIMCHI in-person workshop presentations, and 134 participants participated asynchronously online (via fact sheets on the project website, YouTube videos, and other social media, such as Facebook and X [formerly known as Twitter]). Pre- and postparticipation tests on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors for ADRD and caregiving were conducted with workshop participants. We administered satisfaction surveys to all participants (workshop and online) and conducted two-tailed paired-sample 2-tailed t tests to assess mean changes in the pre- and postparticipation tests.
Results
Among the workshop participants (N=211), most (114/204, 55.9%) were older adults (mean age 69, SD 12.1 y; range 24-90 y), female (n=148, 70.1%), and foreign-born (n=203, 96.2%). Many reported having limited English proficiency (167/211, 79.1%). Significant changes were observed in posttest ADRD knowledge (mean 11.51, SD 2.64), attitudes (mean 7.13, SD 2.83), and behaviors (mean 8.88, SD 2.72) compared to pretest scores (knowledge: mean 10.34, SD 2.67; t210=1.17; P<.001; attitudes: mean 6.33, SD 2.44; t210=0.8; P<.001; and behaviors: mean 8.11, SD 2.68; t210=0.76; P<.001). Workshop participants reported high satisfaction (196/209, 93.8%) with KIMCHI, with the workshop presentations being perceived as culturally relevant and applicable (196/209, 93.8%). Most workshop participants expressed interest in learning more about ADRD-related health topics (186/209, 89%). Similarly, the online participants (N=134) expressed high satisfaction (115/134, 85.8%) and agreed that the topics and content were culturally relevant and applicable (116/133, 87.2%) and learned new information (110/134, 82.1%).
Conclusions
The findings indicate that KIMCHI may have a positive impact on improving ADRD knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among Korean Americans. Academic-community collaborations should continue to culturally tailor the programs and studies to help ensure greater representation of Korean Americans in research and community engagement projects.}

A central challenge lies in elucidating the multiscale mass transport mechanisms of multicomponent fluids within nanopores. However, traditional micro-nano scale models fail to describe the nonlinear features inherent in non-equilibrium transport processes accurately. By integrating multi-physical feature datasets such as pore size distribution, surface potential, and salt concentration, machine learning (ML) can capture nonlinear correlations between membrane structural parameters and mass transfer kinetics, thereby enhancing the spatiotemporal resolution and computational efficiency of fluid transport process simulations. Meanwhile, this data-driven modeling framework that integrates underlying physical fields allows for optimizing polymer molecular structures based on target properties, thus revolutionizing the design process of membrane materials. Therefore, this review focuses on the construction of ML-accelerated multiscale models for mass transfer based on nanofiltration membranes in the desalination process, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and coarse-grained simulations (GCMD and DPD). It also summarizes the “closed-loop” inverse design framework for desalination membrane materials derived from the powerful data-driven capabilities of ML, and analyzes how to inverse derive and optimize the structural parameters and preparation conditions of membrane materials based on target desalination performance requirements. Finally, we discuss the future research directions for ML-assisted NF membrane mass transfer modeling and inverse design, guiding the development of next-generation high-performance intelligent seawater desalination NF membranes.}

abstract = {This study examined the influence of the different heat treatments on the surface and bulk properties and its comparison with the as-printed Ti-6Al-4V counterpart, fabricated through the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique for biomedical applications. Different heat treatment cycles as a post-processing step were incorporated at 670°C and 950°C to optimize phase stability, relieve residual stresses, and enhance material properties. The surface roughness analyses revealed substantial improvement in the surface properties, such as topography, undulation, and minimal pores, with the 950°C heat treatment cycle. The microstructural characterization demonstrated a transformation from α’ martensite to a lamellar α + β phase, reducing dislocation density and improving mechanical integrity, significantly affecting the microhardness and tensile strength with improved biological compatibility. The HT950 samples exhibited a 15% increase in hardness, while HT670 samples showed a 10% decrease compared to untreated samples. Wettability analysis revealed that HT950 samples achieved the highest SFE of 64.8 mN/m with a contact angle of 31.3°, demonstrating superior hydrophilicity along the build direction. Further, bio-tribological assessments highlighted superior wear resistance and reduced friction coefficients in heat-treated samples, particularly under the 950°C condition, attributed to a direct correlation with hardness and refined phase distribution. Biological evaluations using cell culture assays confirmed improved cell viability and adhesion in heat-treated specimens, exhibiting optimal biocompatibility for the 950°C treated sample. The findings underscore the critical role of heat treatment in tailoring the microstructural, mechanical, bio-tribological, and biological attributes of LPBF-produced Ti-6Al-4V for orthopedic implants. This research advances the understanding of post-processing strategies for enhanced durability and biocompatibility in biomedical implants.}

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots such as ChatGPT, renowned for its advanced language generation capabilities and interactive conversational interface, presents a promising opportunity to support teachers in their creativity pursuits. While interest in ChatGPT for educational applications is rising, there is a lack of empirical research exploring its effectiveness in fostering teacher creativity. Therefore, this timely study aims to fill this gap by investigating the efficacy of ChatGPT in facilitating creativity, particularly among English as a foreign (EFL) teachers. A total of twenty-nine teachers enrolled in a post-graduate program participated in the study. Conducting an inductive content analysis, teachers’ ChatGPT inquiry threads, lesson plans, written reflections, and responses to an open-ended survey were analysed. The analysis revealed that ChatGPT enabled teachers to (a) seek for novel perspectives, (b) explore multiple ideas, (c) expand on ideas, (d) change perspectives, (e) refer for information, (f) inquire about teaching tools, and (g) ask for information. Two challenges were also identified: (a) the need for precise input and (b) repetitive content. Building on these findings, a conceptual model is proposed that frames ChatGPT as a tool for creative ideation and a knowledge resource, facilitating EFL teachers' progression towards their Zone of Proximal Creativity, with its effectiveness contingent on the teacher's existing expertise.}

This study investigated the composition of forest understory vegetation in terms of number of species, abundance, and height and their response to livestock grazing intensities in a grazed Village Land Forest Reserve in Tanzania. A 12-month grazing experiment with five grazing cycles was conducted within four blocks of 4 ha each, with 0, 8, 12, and 18 adult cows/ha for control, low, moderate, and high grazing intensities, respectively. A total of 178 plant species belonging to 146 genera and 43 families were recorded. These were classified into nine growth forms; annual climber, annual forb, annual grass, perennial climber, perennial forb, perennial grass, sedge, shrub, and tree seedling, with dominant and co-dominant species found among the annual forbs and tree seedlings, respectively. Low and moderate intensity treatments showed no significant reduction in the number, abundance, and stem height of plant species, while the high intensity treatment showed a significant reduction in abundance and stem height, but not in number of species relative to the control. We conclude that, within the duration of the study, the grazing intensities applied did not affect the number of plant species, whereas both abundance and height were affected significantly. The study indicates that reducing grazing to low or moderate intensities with resting periods can enable the community to benefit from forage production without affecting the vegetation composition of the study forest.}

Our calculations reveal that these substitutions preferentially occupy surface sites on Fe2O3[001], rather than the bulk. Compared to alkaline earth metals, the surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evac), a measure of reducibility, is substantially lower near alkali substitutions, indicating more oxygen release. Additionally, we investigated H2 oxidation and adsorption on pure and Na-substituted Fe2O3[001] surfaces that have an oxygen vacancy. Adsorption energies demonstrate that H2 preferentially dissociates on O top and hollow sites rather than on Fe-related sites. The oxidation of H2 is both thermodynamically and kinetically more advantageous on O sites, resulting in the production of H2O via either direct adsorption or H atom migration pathways. Conversely, Fe sites demonstrate elevated steric hindrances and reduced reactivity. Finally, oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface was identified as a mechanism driven by high temperatures, which may influence oxygen availability during cycling. These findings offer essential understanding of the impact of substitutions on the redox behavior of Fe2O3 OCs, relevant to applications in chemical looping and sustainable hydrogen consumption.}

abstract = {Background
The digitalization of health care organizations is an integral part of a clinician’s daily life, making it vital for health care professionals (HCPs) to understand and effectively use digital tools in hospital settings. However, clinicians often express a lack of preparedness for their digital work environments. Particularly, new clinical end users, encompassing medical and nursing students, seasoned professionals transitioning to new health care environments, and experienced practitioners encountering new health care technologies, face critically intense learning periods, often with a lack of adequate time for learning digital tools, resulting in difficulties in integrating and adopting these digital tools into clinical practice.
Objective
This study aims to comprehensively collect advice from experienced HCPs in Switzerland to guide new clinical end users on how to initiate their engagement with health ITs within hospital settings.
Methods
We conducted qualitative interviews with 52 HCPs across Switzerland, representing 24 medical specialties from 14 hospitals. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Codes were developed iteratively, and themes and aggregated dimensions were refined through collaborative discussions.
Results
Ten themes emerged from the interview data, namely (1) digital tool understanding, (2) peer-based learning strategies, (3) experimental learning approaches, (4) knowledge exchange and support, (5) training approaches, (6) proactive innovation, (7) an adaptive technology mindset, (8) critical thinking approaches, (9) dealing with emotions, and (10) empathy and human factors. Consequently, we devised 10 recommendations with specific advice to new clinical end users on how to approach new health care technologies, encompassing the following: take time to get to know and understand the tools you are working with; proactively ask experienced colleagues; simply try it out and practice; know where to get help and information; take sufficient training; embrace curiosity and pursue innovation; maintain an open and adaptable mindset; keep thinking critically and use your knowledge base; overcome your fears, and never lose the human and patient focus.
Conclusions
Our study emphasized the importance of comprehensive training and learning approaches for health care technologies based on the advice and recommendations of experienced HCPs based in Swiss hospitals. Moreover, these recommendations have implications for medical educators and clinical instructors, providing advice on effective methods to instruct and support new end users, enabling them to use novel technologies proficiently. Therefore, we advocate for new clinical end users, health care institutions and clinical instructors, academic institutions and medical educators, and regulatory bodies to prioritize effective training and cultivating technological readiness to optimize IT use in health care.}

To this end, this study comprehensively reviewed 129 previous studies integrating blockchain into VPPs to propose ways to enhance the performance of VPPs through blockchain. Based on the quantitative analysis of research trends and interests, it was found that while research trends were on the rise, they were still in the early stages, and research interests were somewhat concentrated on energy trading via smart contracts. In other words, the need to propose comprehensive future roadmaps to revitalize early-stage research in a limited field. Based on the qualitative analysis of research status by VPP components, research limitations that provide direction for future roadmaps were identified. As a result, two-level future roadmaps were proposed, consisting of function-level and integration-level roadmaps. Implementing blockchain in VPPs according to the proposed future roadmaps is expected to result in innovative performance enhancement for VPPs and significantly advance the goal of achieving zero carbon.}

This is especially evident the manufacturing sector, where innovation and competitive dynamics intersect with economic and social forces. The current academic discourse predominantly focuses on the qualitative identification and analysis of coopetition attributes, leaving a significant gap for large-scale quantitative studies to enable empirical assessment. This study aims to examine the significance of three groups of coopetition attributes for coopetition performance classified into two strategic (dynamics, paradoxicality), six relational (asymmetry, complexity, coopetition intensity, mutual dependence, strength, tensions), and five behavioral attributes (competition intensity, conflict, formality, investments, trust). Using data from 1216 manufacturing firms in Poland and employing a generalized Covariance based Structural Equation Model (CB-SEM), this study offers nuanced insights to the global discourse at the intersection of technological change and social dynamics. The results indicate that the strategic attribute paradoxicality, the relational attribute strength, and most of the behavioral attributes (trust, competition intensity, investments, formality) positively impact coopetition performance. Additionally, a significant negative impact of the strategic attribute dynamics was demonstrated, while no significant influence was identified for the remaining relational attributes (asymmetry, tensions) as well as the behavioral attribute conflict. Diverging from prior qualitative approaches, this study offers data-driven insights for decision-makers navigating societal and technological change, highlighting which attributes should be stimulated to enhance coopetition performance while minimizing the level of dynamics within coopetition strategies.}

Using a full sample of 1373 U.S. firm-year observations for which the client’s predecessor auditor reports an adverse SOX Section 404 internal control opinion, we find that in the following year a successor auditor who lowballs audit fees is more likely to issue a clean internal control opinion. The results hold when the predecessor auditors are dismissed, but not when the predecessors resign. We also find that firms are no more likely to succeed in opinion shopping when the proportion of audit committee financial experts is high. In addition, we find internal control opinion shopping occurs with initial fee discounting only in competitive audit markets and the period of a few years following the adoption of SOX (since 2007).}

Detecting and labeling online illicit drug trafficking activities have become an important measure to combat online drug trafficking. Recently, machine learning has been applied to drug trafficking detection. However, the effectiveness of conventional supervised learning methods in detecting drug trafficking heavily relies on access to substantial amounts of labeled data, while data annotation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in accurately identifying trafficking activities when drug dealers use deceptive language and euphemisms to avoid detection. To overcome this limitation, we conduct the first systematic study on leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to detect illicit drug trafficking activities on social media. We propose an analytical framework to compose knowledge-informed prompts, which serve as the interface that humans can interact with and use LLMs to perform the detection task. Additionally, we designed a Monte Carlo dropout-based prompt optimization method to further improve performance and interpretability. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline language models in terms of drug trafficking detection accuracy, showing a remarkable improvement of nearly 12%. By integrating prior knowledge and the proposed prompts, ChatGPT can effectively identify and label drug trafficking activities on social networks, even in the presence of deceptive language and euphemisms used by drug dealers to evade detection. The implications of our research extend to social networks, emphasizing the importance of incorporating prior knowledge and scenario-based prompts into analytical tools to improve online security and public safety.}

abstract = {The aim of this research was to propose a new correlation for the onset of significant void (OSV) using a verified database encompassing a broad spectrum of experimental conditions. These conditions included variables such as pressure, inlet subcooling, diameter, length, flow channel, heat flux, and mass flux. The database also accounted for the use of six different coolants (R-113, R-114, R-12, R-22, water, and heavy water) and flow in five distinct heated flow channels (round tube, two types of annular tubes, and two types of rectangular channels). The applicable range of the database is as follows: hydraulic diameter (0.00240–0.0240 m), pressure (1.00–158.00 bar), mass flux (27.50–7500.00 kg/m2s), and heat flux (0.006–8.520 MW/m2). Previous studies have largely focused on acquiring the void fraction distribution, with limited attention given to OSV calculations. To address this gap, we established a database that integrated 206 OSV data points calculated using graphical methods from 402 previously published void fraction distribution datasets. This was further supplemented with 246 verified OSV data points obtained from published literature, resulting in a comprehensive database of 452 OSV data points. Utilizing this database, we developed a new OSV correlation that introduces a novel criterion for flow boiling regions, based on Weber number of 10. This number delineates between a 'surface tension dominated flow region' and an 'inertia dominated flow region.' The new correlation outperformed nine other published correlations in terms of OSV prediction, exhibiting a mean error (ME) of 0.25 % and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 27.56 %.}

abstract = {Trauma emerges as a significant etiological factor associated with a wide range of psychopathologies, including anxiety, mood disorders, impulse dysregulation, psychosis, substance dependence, personality disorders, conduct issues, and suicidal behavior. Furthermore, trauma plays a central role in somatoform and alexithymic disorders, eating disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. Additionally, trauma is linked to the development of various physical health conditions such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer. Thus, the negative health consequences of trauma extend beyond PTSD and often manifest in personalized, polysymptomatic, and polysyndromic ways, suggesting the utility of adopting transdiagnostic approaches. This study focuses on validating the Arousal Modulation Model Questionnaire (AMMQ), grounded in Ogden and Minton's Arousal Modulation Model originating from Siegel's concept of the Window of Tolerance. The validation process encompasses multiple facets of questionnaire validation, including construct validity, reliability, and other psychometric properties. Participants included a sample of 304 individuals recruited for this study, with a mean age of 39.36 years (SD = 12.88). Although participants may have experienced one or more traumatic events in their lives, they were currently not under the care of the National Health Service Psychiatry Centers. Construct validity of the AMMQ was assessed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Initial exploratory factor analysis revealed a coherent factor structure consistent with theoretical expectations derived from the Arousal Modulation Model, yielding four distinct factors: "Optimal Arousal Zone" (OAZ, 7 items), "Fight/Flight" (FF, 4 items), Freeze (Fr, 6 items), and "Feigned Death" (FD, 5 items). Subsequent confirmatory factor analysis supported this structure, demonstrating excellent model fit (χ²(203) = 381.738, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.94; TLI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.05; SRMR = 0.05). Internal consistency was high, with a mean categorical omega (ω) of 0.83 across all subscales, supporting the reliability of the AMMQ. Convergent validity was assessed by examining the associations between each AMMQ subscale and a set of established external measures. The Optimal Arousal Zone (OAZ) subscale showed strong positive correlations with all dimensions of psychological well-being (PWB-SF) and negative correlations with emotional distress (DASS-21), dissociation (DES-II). Conversely, all three dysregulation subscales—Fight-or-Flight (FF), Freeze (Fr), and Feigned Death (FD)—were positively associated with anxiety, depression, stress, and dissociation, as well as with increased autonomic reactivity measured by the BPQ-22 (all p < 0.001). The AMMQ test-retest reliability was also good (0.83). Overall, the validation results suggest that the Arousal Modulation Model Questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing arousal modulation processes within the context of stress reactivity. Its good psychometric properties make it a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers working in trauma-informed assessment and intervention. Finally, robust correlations between all AMMQ factors and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) scales (all p < 0.001) bolster its efficacy for transdiagnostic screening in psychotherapy, clinical research, and various psychological well-being interventions (e.g., mindfulness-based approaches).}

Ni1Zr1Al2-R, with specific surface area (SBET) of 145.6 m2, narrow pore size distribution of 7.1 nm, and small Ni0 particle size of 7.31 nm, showed 100 % furfural conversion and 94.5 % tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol selectivity under mild conditions (140 °C, 2 h). It was found that furfural was first hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol, which was further hydrogenated to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. XRD and TEM showed that Ni0 (111) plane played an important role on the catalytic hydrogenation process. Al increased the specific surface area (SBET) and total acid sites of the catalyst, providing more possibilities for the catalyst to contact the substrate. The introduction of Zr improved the ratio of medium acid sites and decreased the size of metal nickel particles, improving the resistance to carbon deposition and allowing the structure and catalytic performance to remain stable after five recycles.}

Despite its importance, there is limited moment-to-moment evidence on reading processes in multiple-text use. To bridge this gap, we used eye-tracking technology to see how task instructions affect reading multiple texts with high and low trustworthiness. The transitions among texts and source information, as well as how much attention the readers paid are particularly of concern. Sixty-one college students were randomly divided into summary and argument groups, tasked with writing a summary or an argument, respectively. Both groups read four texts presenting conflicting views on genetically modified technology. Each text featured high or low trustworthiness and included three paragraphs: source, evidence, and conclusion. Results of eye-movement data showed both groups spent more time rereading high-trustworthiness texts and evidence paragraphs. The summary group notably reread more on source information, made more transitions between source and evidence, and accessed texts more times than the argument group. In essay writing, the summary group showed better integration by using more source citations and connectives and referring to more concepts, compared to the argument group. Mediation analysis revealed that the process data of rereading time and number of click times successfully mediated the relationship between task instructions and multiple-text integration, confirming that the summary group engaged deeply. These findings offer both theoretical contributions and practical implications for developing adaptive, personalized digital reading environments.}

abstract = {To better prepare higher education graduates for the early stages of their careers, universities aim to bridge the gap between classroom teaching and the skills demanded by industry, particularly in the field of procurement. Today, procurement professionals increasingly require specialised skill sets, rather than generalist education, to effectively fulfil their role-specific responsibilities. This study integrates experiential learning theory with game-based learning by presenting a synthesised model that unites both perspectives. Building on this model, a purchasing-specific game is employed to compare traditional lecture-based teaching with experiential game-based learning, focusing on purchasing skills as well as cognitive and affective learning outcomes. The effectiveness of the game-based approach is examined through a group comparison experiment, contrasting students who played the game (N = 202) with those who attended conventional lectures (N = 135). The findings indicate that the game effectively develops purchasing and supply management (PSM) skills relevant to professional practice. Moreover, students evaluated the game as a highly positive learning experience, and it outperformed traditional lecturing in most skill-related, cognitive, and affective outcomes, ultimately leading to improved examination performance. For educators, the study highlights the design and implementation of the serious game, its pedagogical implications, and directions for future research in procurement education and beyond.}

abstract = {Software defect prediction (SDP) is crucial for improving software quality and optimizing resource allocation by identifying potential defects at early development stages. Traditional SDP methods rely on manually crafted static features, which often fail to capture the semantic and contextual information in code. Recent advances using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) have improved semantic feature extraction, yet they often neglect structural dependencies and lack effective integration with static features. To address these limitations, this study proposes GLA-SDP, a novel defect prediction model that fuses features through the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and an additive attention fusion mechanism. Specifically, a recursive AST-to-graph construction method is designed to extract rich semantic features using GCNs, while LSTMs are employed to capture sequential patterns from static code metrics. Furthermore, an attention-based fusion mechanism dynamically weight and combine semantic and static features, preserving their complementary importance in defect prediction. Extensive experiments on eight Java projects from the PROMISE dataset and four C-language projects from the Devign dataset demonstrate that GLA-SDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 37 % in F1-score and 24 % in MCC. These results highlight the superior accuracy and practical applicability of the proposed approach.}

Although the characteristics of a dam break wave after a complete dam break have been investigated extensively, studies on partial dam break processes have been rare. To this end, this paper proposed a hydraulic model for partial dam breaks based on the water flow through a sluice gate. Five different hydraulic models using 459 datasets of sluice gate flows from both experimental tests and the literature were evaluated. A stepwise algorithm was developed by combining the sluice gate flow model with the law of mass conservation; this algorithm was used to develop a predictive model for the flow and level of water during partial dam breaks. Based on the water-level data obtained from partial dam break simulations, the hydraulic model was improved by introducing time and submergence correction coefficients. Compared with the experimental results, the mean absolute percentage error of the corrected model was 1.572 %, indicating a high prediction accuracy. Consequently, the proposed model can provide important technical support for managing partial dam break.}

Through a systematic prompt design process, a synthetic dataset of 3585 images across 27 hazardous scenarios was generated. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the performance of DNN models trained on these virtual images, which achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of approximately 64% in object detection and 60% in segmentation tasks.

Soil recovery and the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, such as organic farming, are essential to address this challenge. Smart organic farming improves soil quality, crop productivity, and water retention capacity. In this context, vermiculture, which utilizes Eisenia Foetida (red worms), plays a fundamental role. This article highlights how humus production through vermiculture has been significantly optimized through an Edge AIoT platform that integrates an agricultural recommendation system based on bio-inspired algorithms, an LSTM network for predicting humus and worm populations, and a control system to regulate variables such as temperature, humidity, and pH. The results show an increase in humus production from 37.58% to 87.88% and in the worm population from 35.5% to 83%. Vermicompost, obtained through the non-thermophilic biodegradation of organic waste by worms, acts as a crucial biofertilizer that sustainably increases crop yields and helps farmers adapt to environmental stresses, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Finally, seven experiments were conducted in which the Edge AIoT-based agricultural recommendation platform optimized the vermicomposting process, improving efficiency and productivity in humus production. This technological approach not only mitigates the impact of climate change but also supports the recovery of degraded soils and promotes sustainable agricultural practices essential for ensuring future food security.}

DL-based strategies have displayed superior performance in image processing compared to conventional standard methods, especially in healthcare settings. Among the biggest threats to global public health is the fast spread of malaria. The plasmodium falciparum infection, the disease origin causes the intestinal illness. Fortunately, advances in artificial intelligence techniques have made it possible to use visual data sets to quickly and effectively diagnose malaria which has also proven to be cost and time effective. In literature, several DL approaches have previously been used with good precision but suffer from computational inefficiency and interpretability. Therefore, this research proposes a generalized fractional order-based explainable lightweight convolutional neural network model to overcome these limitations. The fractional order optimization algorithms have proven worth in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence speed for different applications. The proposed fractional order optimizer-based model offers an improved solution to malaria disease diagnosis with a percentage accuracy of 95 % using the standard NIH dataset and outperforms the existing complex models concerning speed and effectiveness. The proposed fractionally optimized lightweight CNN model has shown substantial performance on the external MP-IDB dataset and M5 test set as well by achieving a generalized test accuracy of 92 % and 90.4 % which verifies the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution under available circumstances. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed lightweight architecture is endorsed through evaluation metrics of precision, recall, and F1-score.}

We conducted a review of the literature and included laboratory, animal, and human studies evaluating biochemical and genetic data, completed and ongoing clinical trials, and public programs in this review. Our analysis describes the potential mechanisms related to 6 domains including genetic predisposition, circadian rhythms, physical activity and sedentary behavior, metabolomics, the gut microbiome, and behavioral and socioeconomic characteristics, i.e., the factors that can be leveraged to design PN-based interventions to prevent and treat obesity-related outcomes such as weight loss or metabolic health as laid out by the NIH 2030 Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research. For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms can modify responses to certain dietary interventions, and epigenetic modulation of obesity risk via physical activity patterns and macronutrient intake have also been demonstrated. Additionally, we identified limitations including questions of equitable implementation across a limited number of clinical trials. These include the limited ability of current PN interventions to address systemic influences such as supply chains and food distribution, healthcare systems, racial or cultural inequities, and economic disparities, particularly when designing and implementing PN interventions in low- and middle-income communities. PN has the potential to help manage obesity by addressing intra- and inter-individual variation as well as context, as opposed to “one-size fits all” approaches though there is limited clinical trial evidence to date.}

Participants were more motivated to receive feedback from liked peers, and they rated acceptance from liked peers as more pleasant than rejection. Notably, participants found longer waits more worthwhile when receiving acceptance from liked peers, but less worthwhile when awaiting feedback from disliked peers. EEG results revealed that the RewP was increased for long waiting times for feedback from liked peers, and, conversely, reduced for long waiting times for feedback from disliked peers. Additionally, N170 and P3 were found to be sensitive to waiting time, with larger amplitudes for long compared to short waits. Overall, this study demonstrates that waiting time differentially affects social feedback processing, as reflected by changes in the N170, RewP, and P3. Our findings suggest that increased waiting time does not necessarily reduce reward value; it can enhance it depending on subjective social preferences. The increased N170 and P3 amplitudes during longer waits may indicate heightened attentional and memory demands. This study advances our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying social decision-making.}

abstract = {Personalised dietary advice has become increasingly popular, currently however most approaches are based on an individual's genetic and phenotypic profile whilst largely ignoring other determinants such as socio economic and cognitive variables. This paper provides novel insights by testing the effectiveness of personalised healthy eating advice concurrently tailored to an individual's socio-demographic group, cognitive characteristics, and sensory preferences. We first used existing data to build a synthetic dataset based on information from 3654 households (Study 1a), and then developed a cluster model to identify individuals characterised by similar socio-demographic, cognitive, and sensory aspects (Study 1b). Finally, in Study 2 we used the characteristics of 8 clusters to build 8 separate personalised food choice advice and assess their ability to motivate the increased consumption of fruit and vegetables and decreased intakes of saturated fat and sugar. We presented 218 participants with either generic UK Government “EatWell” advice, advice that was tailored to their allocated cluster (matched personalised), or advice tailored to a different cluster (unmatched personalised). Results showed that, when compared to generic advice, participants that received matched personalised advice were significantly more likely to indicate they would change their diet. Participants were similarly motivated to increase vegetable consumption and decrease saturated fat intake when they received unmatched personalised advice, potentially highlighting the power of providing alternative food choices. Overall, this study demonstrated that the power of personalizing food choice advice, based on a combination of individual characteristics, can be more effective than current approaches in motivating dietary change. Our study also emphasizes the viability of addressing population health through automatically delivered web-based personalised advice.}

abstract = {Given the increasing number and severity of cyber attacks, there has been a surge in cybersecurity information across various mediums such as posts, news articles, reports, and other resources. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves processing data from these cybersecurity sources, enabling professionals and organizations to gain valuable insights. However, with the rapid dissemination of cybersecurity information, the inclusion of fake CTI can lead to severe consequences, including data poisoning attacks. To address this challenge, we have implemented a three-step strategy: generating synthetic CTI, evaluating the quality of the generated CTI, and detecting fake CTI. Unlike other subdomains, such as fake COVID news detection, there is currently no publicly available dataset specifically tailored for fake CTI detection research. To address this gap, we first establish a reliable groundtruth dataset by utilizing domain-specific cybersecurity data to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) for synthetic CTI generation. We then employ crowdsourcing techniques and advanced synthetic data verification methods to evaluate the quality of the generated dataset, introducing a novel evaluation methodology that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that the generated CTI cannot be distinguished from genuine CTI by human annotators, regardless of their computer science background, demonstrating the effectiveness of our generation approach. We benchmark various misinformation detection techniques against our groundtruth dataset to establish baseline performance metrics for identifying fake CTI. By leveraging existing techniques and adapting them to the context of fake CTI detection, we provide a foundation for future research in this critical field. To facilitate further research, we make our code, dataset, and experimental results publicly available on GitHub.}

abstract = {Air Traffic Management aims at ensuring safety during aircraft operations, particularly within Terminal Manoeuvring Areas where traffic density is high. The challenge lies in balancing safety and efficiency by closely managing the likelihood of mid-air collisions regarding the airport movements. Traditional models like the Reich and Anderson-Hsu models have been influential, but they fall short in representing the complex reality of Terminal Manoeuvring Areas. Data-driven approaches are emerging, with Monte Carlo simulations offering a more flexible methodology for collision risk estimation. This paper introduces a framework for assessing Mid-Air Collision likelihood resulting from Terminal Manoeuvring Area procedures by combining the field of Deep Generative Modelling using a Variational Autoencoder with the domain of rare event statistics through Subset Simulation. By incorporating disentanglement into the Variational Autoencoders model, we create a latent space that aligns dimensions with distinctive trajectory traits. Then, Subset Simulation is employed to gauge Mid-Air Collision probability, utilizing latent representations as input. Finally, sensitivity analysis reveals pivotal factors influencing collision risk, correlated with trajectory attributes via disentanglement. The methodology is applied to traffic around Zurich Airport: it evaluates the risk arising from go-around and take-off procedures using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast data.}

abstract = {The exponential increase in the annual volume of publications places a significant challenge in assessing the disruptive potential of technologies in new papers. Prior approaches to identifying disruptive technologies based on the accumulation of paper citations are characterized by their limited prospective and time-consuming nature. Moreover, the total citation count fails to capture the intricate network of citations associated with the focal papers. Consequently, we advocate for the utilization of the disruption index instead of depending on citation counts. Particularly, we devise a novel neural network, called Soft Prompt-aware Shared BERT (SPS-BERT), to predict the potential technological disruption index of immediately published papers. It incorporates separate soft prompts to enable BERT examining comparative details within a paper's abstract and its references. Additionally, a tailored attention mechanism is employed to intensify the semantic comparison. Based on the enhanced representation derived from BERT, we utilize a linear layer to estimate potential disruption index. Experimental results demonstrate that SPS-BERT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in predicting five-year disruption index across the DBLP and PubMed datasets. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation of our model to predict the ten-year disruption index and five-year citation increments, demonstrating its robustness and scalability. Notably, our model's predictions of disruptive technologies, based on papers published in 2022, align with the expert assessments released by MIT, highlighting its practical significance.

abstract = {The Gut Microbiome-Liver-Brain Axis is a relatively novel construct with promising potential to enhance our understanding of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and its therapeutic approaches. Significant alterations in the gut microbiome occur in AUD even before any other systemic signs or symptoms manifest. Prolonged and inappropriate alcohol consumption, by affecting the gut microbiota and gut mucosa permeability, is thought to contribute to the development of behavioral and cognitive impairments, leading to Alcohol-Related Liver Disorders and potentially progressing into alcoholic cirrhosis, which is often associated with severe cognitive impairment related to neurodegeneration, such as hepatic encephalopathy and alcoholic dementia. The critical role of the gut microbiota is further supported by the efficacy of FDA-approved treatments for hepatic encephalopathy in alcoholic cirrhosis (i.e., lactulose and rifaximin). To stimulate new research, we hypothesize that interactions between a maladaptive stress response and a constitutional predisposition to neurodegeneration underlie the progression of AUD to conditions of Alcohol-Related Clinical Concerns with severe cognitive impairment, which represent a significant and costly burden to society. Early identification of AUD individuals at risk for developing these conditions could help to prioritize integrated therapeutic interventions targeting different substrates of the Gut Microbiome-Liver-Brain axis. Specifically, addiction medications, microbiome modulators, stress-reducing interventions, and, possibly soon, novel agents that reduce hepatic steatosis/fibrosis will be discussed in the context of digitally supported integrated therapeutic approaches. The explicit goal of this AUD treatment performed on the early stage of the disorder would be to reduce the transition from AUD to those conditions of Alcohol-Related Common Clinical Concerns associated with severe cognitive impairment, a strategy recommended for most neurological neurodegenerative disorders.}
