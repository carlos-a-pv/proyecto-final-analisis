abstract = {Background:
Modeling heterogeneous disease states by data-driven methods has great potential to advance biomedical research. However, a comprehensive analysis of phenotypic heterogeneity is often challenged by the complex nature of biomedical datasets and emerging imaging methodologies.
Methods:
Here, we propose a novel GAN Inversion-enabled Latent Eigenvalue Analysis (GILEA) framework and apply it to in silico phenome profiling and editing.
Results:
We show the performance of GILEA using cellular imaging datasets stained with the multiplexed fluorescence Cell Painting protocol. The quantitative results of GILEA can be biologically supported by editing of the latent representations and simulation of dynamic phenotype transitions between physiological and pathological states.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, GILEA represents a new and broadly applicable approach to the quantitative and interpretable analysis of biomedical image data. The GILEA code and video demos are available at https://github.com/CTPLab/GILEA.}

This paper introduces a novel framework for the inverse generative design of composite structures, leveraging a classifier-free diffusion model conditioned on prescribed nonlinear mechanical behaviors under large equibiaxial extension deformation. The proposed model is trained using the Mechanical MNIST Cahn-Hilliard dataset, enabling it to generate high-fidelity structures that closely align with prescribed input conditions. The generated structures exhibit mechanical behaviors that strongly align with ground truth data, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in achieving targeted mechanical behaviors. A comprehensive evaluation of the framework under varying conditions highlights its adaptability and precision, further supported by an analysis of the model's overall accuracy. This work presents a robust pipeline for conditional generative design, offering a significant step forward in tailoring composite structures to meet specific nonlinear mechanical requirements. The proposed approach underscores the potential of diffusion-based methods in advancing the design of materials with complex mechanical behaviors.}

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has emerged as a public health priority due to its high prevalence, silent clinical course, and liver and systemic outcomes. With an estimated prevalence of 30% in the general population, MASLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Apart from the underlying metabolic factors, MASLD development and progression are strongly influenced by social and commercial determinants of health, and an associated stigma, which perpetuate inequities and hinder access to high-quality clinical management. In this Personal View, we explore how social and commercial determinants of health shape environments that promote the development and progression of MASLD. We also examine how stigma acts as an underestimated barrier, contributing to diagnostic delays and impaired quality of life in people with MASLD. Based on an integrative perspective, we propose a comprehensive and multisectoral approach for the sustainable management of MASLD.}

abstract = {Background
When selecting clinical predictive tools, clinicians are challenged with an overwhelming and ever-growing number, most of which have never been implemented or evaluated for effectiveness. The authors developed an evidence-based framework for grading and assessment of predictive tools (GRASP). The objective of this study is to refine, validate GRASP, and assess its reliability for consistent application.
Methods
A mixed-methods study was conducted, involving an initial web-based survey for feedback from a wide group of international experts in clinical prediction to refine the GRASP framework, followed by reliability testing with two independent researchers assessing eight predictive tools. The survey involved 81 experts who rated agreement with the framework's criteria on a five-point Likert scale and provided qualitative feedback. The reliability of the GRASP framework was evaluated through interrater reliability testing using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
Results
The survey yielded strong agreement of the experts with the framework's evaluation criteria, overall average score: 4.35/5, highlighting the importance of predictive performance, usability, potential effect, and post-implementation impact in grading clinical predictive tools. Qualitative feedback led to significant refinements, including detailed categorisation of evidence levels and clearer representation of evaluation criteria. Interrater reliability testing showed high agreement between researchers and authors (0.994) and among researchers (0.988), indicating strong consistency in tool grading.
Conclusion
The GRASP framework provides a high-level, evidence-based, and comprehensive, yet simple and feasible, approach to evaluate, compare, and select the best clinical predictive tools, with strong expert agreement and high interrater reliability. It assists clinicians in selecting effective tools by grading them on the level of validation of predictive performance before implementation, usability and potential effect during planning for implementation, and post-implementation impact on healthcare processes and clinical outcomes. Future studies should focus on the framework's application in clinical settings and its impact on decision-making and guideline development.}

abstract = {Introduction
Refractory foot ulcers, characterized by prolonged healing and frequent recurrences, challenge existing therapies such as revascularization and compression, which typically fail to prevent amputation. We developed adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell line-derived platelet-like cells (ASCL-PLCs) for refractory ulcers that are long-lasting and readily available.
Methods
A translational preclinical investigation and phase 1/2a first-in-human clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel allogeneic ASCL-PLC treatment for refractory foot ulcers. In the pre-clinical phase, ASCL-PLCs were cryopreserved for 9 months and then thawed to measure cytokine release after calcium chloride stimulation. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a diabetic mouse wound model, comparing ASCL-PLC treatment with vehicle control. The clinical trial involved topically applying ASCL-PLCs (1.5 × 108 cells/cm2) to the ulcers of four patients (two ischemic, two venous) on days 0, 14, and 28, with safety and efficacy monitored based on adverse events, ulcer size reduction, epithelialization time, and pain score changes.
Results
ASCL-PLCs maintained considerable cytokine-releasing activity even after long-term cryopreservation. In the diabetic mouse skin defect model, treatment with ASCL-PLCs substantially enhanced wound closure compared with the controls, demonstrating potent wound-healing capabilities. In the clinical trial, all patients exhibited notable ulcer size reduction without serious adverse events; three achieved epithelialization within 6 months, along with improvements in pain and quality of life without a negative impact on local blood flow.
Conclusions
ASCL-PLCs are safe and a promising therapeutic option for refractory ulcers and can potentially reduce amputation rates, improve patient outcomes, and minimize the socioeconomic impact due to chronic wounds. Their long shelf life and cryopreservation stability make wound management practical and accessible. Moreover, their efficacy with simple topical application suggests a minimally invasive strategy suitable for outpatient care. Further large-scale trials are recommended.

Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is a common complication in older critically ill patients that has a significant impact. The Family Confusion Assessment Method (FAM-CAM) is a vital tool for assisting family members in identifying delirium; however, no study has yet been reported on the Chinese version of the scale.
Objectives
The objective of this study was to translate the FAM-CAM into a Chinese version and to verify its effectiveness for delirium detection in an online patient visit setting.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study. The FAM-CAM was translated to Chinese according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines. Patients and family members were recruited to participate in delirium assessments in three ICUs of one hospital. Family members then used the Chinese version of the FAM-CAM to assess for delirium via online visitation, and ICU nurses assessed patients for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Results were then compared between family members' and nurses' assessments.
Results
Overall, 190 critically ill patients and 190 family members were included, of whom 117 (61.6%) were assessed for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. The Cohen's kappa coefficient between the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist and FAM-CAM was 0.759 (P < 0.01). The sensitivity of the Chinese version of the FAM-CAM was 0.880, specificity was 0.890, positive predictive value was 0.928, negative predictive value was 0.823, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.881 (95% confidence interval: 0.872–0.935, P < 0.01).
Conclusion
The Chinese version of the FAM-CAM was shown to effectively help families detect delirium and was suggested as a crucial tool for assisting ICU nurses in the early identification of delirium. This tool may effectively be used to assess delirium during online visits.}

abstract = {Background
The management of fracture-related infection has undergone radical progress following the development of international guidelines. However, there is limited consideration to the realities of healthcare in low-resource environments due to a lack of available evidence in the literature from these settings. Initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture union is frequently used in low- and middle-income countries despite the lack of published clinical evidence to support its practice. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes following initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture union in the management of fracture-related infection.
Methods
A retrospective review of consecutive patients treated with initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture healing followed by definitive eradication surgery to manage fracture-related infections following intramedullary fixation was performed. Indications for this approach were; a soft tissue envelope not requiring reconstructive surgery, radiographic evidence of stable fixation with adequate alignment, and progression towards fracture union.
Results
This approach was associated with successful treatment in 51/55 (93 %) patients. Fracture union was achieved in 52/55 (95 %) patients with antimicrobial suppression alone. Remission of infection was achieved in 54/55 (98 %) patients following definitive infection eradication surgery. Following antibiotic suppression, 6/46 (13 %) pathogens isolated from intra-operative samples demonstrated multi-drug resistance.
Conclusion
Initial antimicrobial suppression to support fracture healing followed by definitive infection eradication surgery was associated with successful treatment in 93 % of patients. The likelihood of remission of infection increases when eradication surgery is performed in a healed bone. This approach was not associated with an increased risk of developing multi-drug-resistant infections compared to contemporary bone infection cohorts in the published literature.

It explores the international legal framework for child protection, which integrates International Humanitarian Law, International Human Rights Law, and International Criminal Law to mitigate the impacts of conflict and ensure accountability for violations. Despite the existence of robust legal instruments, a persistent gap remains between legal norms and their effective implementation, resulting in ongoing harm to children. The article highlights how international law not only prohibits acts such as killing, maiming, and attacks on schools and hospitals but also mandates obligations for recovery, reintegration, and access to health and education—implicitly addressing the psycho-physical harm children endure. Arguing that legal understanding must extend beyond legal professionals to include healthcare providers, the article calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to protect children more effectively. It concludes by advocating for the integration of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) as an explicit and adequately resourced component of the right to health in humanitarian responses, to address the full spectrum of children's needs in conflict settings.}

abstract = {Objectives
Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS), secondary to various underlying diseases, is one of the main causes of intestinal failure in children. Surgical management by serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP), is feasible in selected cases, but results on long-term follow-up are scarce. The aim of this study was to report long-term outcomes of the STEP procedure in children with SBS.
Methods
We performed a multicenter national retrospective study reviewing medical charts of children who underwent a STEP technique between 2000 and 2022 in 6 university hospitals. Collected data included demographics, SBS history, surgical procedures, nutritional support (enteral or parenteral), STEP management, complications, and outcomes (nutritional support, digestive symptoms, growth).
Results
STEP was performed in 36 SBS, resulting from 14 gastroschisis, 10 intestinal atresia, 8 necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), 2 midgut volvulus, and 2 intestinal Hirschsprung disease. Median age at first STEP was 10.8 months [4.5; 63.8]. Bowel length significantly increased (47 vs 70 cm, p < 0.01), with a median gain of 16 cm [11; 25] or 34%. At surgery, 33 children had parenteral nutrition (PN). A second STEP was performed in 11 patients, at a median age of 4.2 years [2.8; 6.8]. One patient underwent a third STEP. Two children required intestinal transplantation. Median follow-up was 7 years [4.4;11.4]. Out of 33 children requiring PN before surgery, 14 children were weaned off PN. The remaining 19 children still required PN, but their dependency decreased by 19%. Out of 17 children presenting severe intestinal dilations and bacterial overgrowth, 12 became asymptomatic. Out of 20 with chronic obstructive symptoms, 8 patients still required supplementary PN whereas 12 achieved complete enteral autonomy, including 3 requiring supplementary enteral support.
Conclusion
STEP technique remains a surgical option in the management of these children, enabling a decrease in PN dependency, resulting in weaning off PN in some cases, as well as an improvement of clinical symptoms.

Clinical practice guidelines suggest maintaining adequate hydration in people with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, the long-term perceptions of increasing water intake and the role of self-efficacy tools are unknown.
Methods
Participants randomized to the increased water intake arm in a 3-year trial were purposively sampled and invited to semistructured interviews at the end of the study. In addition, all participants (n = 78) in the increased water intake arm were invited to complete a posttrial questionnaire.
Results
Fifteen participants completed the interview and 48 (61.5%) completed the questionnaire. Participants were motivated to adhere to the increased water intake at the start of the trial, but it became more difficult over time. Approximately half of the participants found that it was “easy” to meet fluid intake goals without interfering with their lifestyle. The main barrier was “loss of control” particularly when implementing increased water intake at social events. Furthermore, participants’ somatic and emotional state undermined motivation. Regarding self-efficacy tools, the act of carrying water bottles was considered most useful for monitoring intake; self-monitoring urine specific gravity provided positive reinforcement, and mobile phone text message reminders maintained engagement. At the end of the trial, most participants had established knowledge and habits required to increase water intake but the motivation to continue long-term was contingent on a medical benefit.
Conclusion
Habit formation to increase water intake was perceived as relatively uncomplicated by most participants. However, the gap between intention and behavior fluctuated because of intermittent social barriers and widened over time.}

abstract = {Background
The Seegene Allplex™ RV Master (RVM) assay is a one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system for detecting eight viral respiratory pathogens from nasopharyngeal swab, aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. The eight RVM targets are: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B (Flu B), Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV), rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and metapneumovirus (MPV). The assay is based on Seegene’s multiple detection temperature (MuDT) technology and provides cycle threshold (Ct) values for each of its viral targets upon PCR completion.
Objective
We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the RVM assay by calculating sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Positive Percent Agreement (PPA), Negative Percent Agreement (NPA), and Overall Percent Agreement (OPA) compared to definite diagnosis and analogous reference assays.
Study design
Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV were calculated by comparing the results of the RVM assay to that of definite diagnosis assays; while PPA, NPA, and OPA were calculated by comparing results of the RVM assay to that of analogous reference products. Definite diagnosis and reference methods comprised whole genome sequencing and PCR genotyping, the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV and Respiratory Panels 1, 2, and 3 assays (Seegene), and the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Plus assay (Cepheid). Reproducibility of the RVM assay using fully-automated and semi-automated nucleic acid (NA) extraction workflows and as performed by independent operators was also assessed. In total, 249 positive respiratory specimens and at least 50 negative specimens for each target tested were used for this evaluation study.
Results
Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, PPA, NPA, and OPA ranged from 95.7 % to 100 % for detecting all eight targets tested on the RVM assay. Reproducibility PPA, NPA, and OPA between automated and semi-automated NA extraction workflows were all >97.9 %, while the reproducibility PPA, NPA and OPA between independent operators were all 100 %.
Conclusion
These results demonstrate a high level of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and diagnostic predictive value of the RVM assay and high agreement with comparable reference assays in identifying all eight of its targets. Taken together, our study underscores the diagnostic utility of the RVM assay in detecting eight viral respiratory pathogens.}

abstract = {Medical chatbots are becoming essential components of telemedicine applications as tools to assist patients in the self-management of their conditions. This trend is particularly driven by advancements in natural language processing techniques with pre-trained language models (LMs). However, the integration of LMs into clinical environments faces challenges related to reliability and privacy concerns. This study seeks to address these issues by exploiting a privacy by design architectural solution that utilises the fully local deployment of open-source LMs. Specifically, to mitigate any risk of information leakage, we focus on evaluating the performance of open-source language models (SLMs) that can be deployed on personal devices, such as smartphones or laptops, without stringent hardware requirements. We assess the effectiveness of this solution adopting hypertension management as a case study. Models are evaluated across various tasks, including intent recognition and empathetic conversation, using Gemini Pro 1.5 as a benchmark. The results indicate that, for certain tasks such as intent recognition, Gemini outperforms other models. However, by employing the “large language model (LLM) as a judge” approach for semantic evaluation of response correctness, we found several models that demonstrate a close alignment with the ground truth. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of locally deployed SLMs as components of medical chatbots, while addressing critical concerns related to privacy and reliability.}

To quantitatively assess this emerging trend, previous studies have conducted bibliometric analyses using publication databases to elucidate leading affiliations, research themes, and the contributions and research focuses of key players, including mega pharma, big IT firms, AI startups, and academic institutions. However, quantitative analyses that leverage patent databases to capture these significant shifts and assess the contributions of the key players are scarce. This study investigated technological trends in AI applications within the pharmaceutical industry and clarify the roles and strategic focuses of key players through patent analysis. A total of 1365 AI-related pharmaceutical patent applications in the United States between 2000 and 2023 were identified. Through a detailed analysis of patents, we revealed that AI is strategically employed across critical business domains, including drug discovery, drug development, diagnosis, manufacturing, marketing, and healthcare. Moreover, the study unveiled the specific business areas where each key player has focused their AI-driven initiatives and historical contributions to AI applications in the pharmaceutical industry. The findings underscore both patent and literature analyses are essential to comprehensively assess AI applications and contributions of key players in the pharmaceutical industry.}

This approach led to the identification of 93 proteins primarily involved in central metabolism that are secreted under various physiological conditions, including 16 previously characterized moonlighting proteins. Promiscuity analysis of five selected enzymes revealed that three (asparaginase, chorismate mutase, and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase) exhibit high potential for catalyzing reactions with non-canonical substrates, suggesting additional functional roles beyond their primary enzymatic activities. Additionally, we re-annotated previously hypothetical secreted proteins, assigning functions related to central metabolism and indicating a high potential for promiscuous activity. This comprehensive compilation of potential moonlighting and promiscuous proteins in Xanthomonas provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving plant-pathogen interactions and establishes a foundation for future experimental validations of these multifunctional proteins.}

Chronic pain is a common healthcare issue among adults. It is not only correlated with structural impairments; it is also strongly influenced by psychological and social factors. This study aimed to identify risk factors for the onset of musculoskeletal chronic pain in adulthood during the periods of birth, childhood and adolescence.
Methods
In order to investigate the literature on our topic of interest in detail, we decided to undertake a scoping review. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro. We also searched the bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews, as well as Google Scholar.
Results
A total of 169 studies were included in the analysis. Of these, 139 were conducted in Europe and the USA between January 2016 and June 2023. The female sample was larger, with 49265 patients. A total of 171 different risk factors and their definitions were identified. The most frequently reported risk factors were sexual abuse (104 cases), physical abuse (91 cases) and childhood trauma (59 cases). Other cited risk factors included family factors, psychological abuse, morbidity during childhood and socio-economic background.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors present in early life that contribute to the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adulthood. Despite the various factors described, many studies agree that exposure to multiple risk factors, particularly adverse childhood experiences, increases the likelihood of developing chronic pain in adulthood more than exposure to a single factor.}

Specifically, the pristine Zn-based MOF undergoes selective Zn-to-Mn exchange through a carefully controlled solvothermal transmetalation process. This protocol generates a series of Mn-doped MOFs with increasing Mn integration and the concomitant formation of defect sites within the framework. Detailed structural characterization confirms the successful Mn doping and illuminates the generation of vacancies and distortions around the exchanged Mn nodes. The transmetallated Mn-doped MOF materials exhibit altered chemical environments, as probed by spectroscopic techniques, and display promising sensing activity for NOx through the MOF matrix membrane.

The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has driven the digitalization and intelligence of spectral analysis. However, the complexity of environmental samples and spectral overlap remain a major challenge. This study proposes a multi-component HM detection method that integrates ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) superimposed spectra with deep learning to address the issue of spectral overlap. By using combinatorial chemical probes to enhance the specificity of colorimetric reactions and conducting high-throughput experiments to collect spectra, a Transformer model is trained to extract qualitative and quantitative information in an end-to-end manner. During the method development phase, the model was trained using five representative HMs (Sb, Fe, Ni, Cd, Cu) to verify its recognition ability under complex conditions (average R² = 0.936, RMSE = 0.132 mg L−1, MAE = 0.054 mg L−1). The method was then extended to detect ten HMs in real-world samples, demonstrating its scalability and robustness (average R² = 0.681, RMSE = 0.189 mg L−1). These results show that the method can simultaneously analyze multiple HMs and transition from spectral fingerprints to quantified ecological risk profiles. Additionally, the AI analysis software developed in this study automates the entire process from spectral input to multi-index detection and risk assessment, providing environmental regulatory authorities with minute-level response capabilities and facilitating proactive early warning for HM pollution control.}

As a widely used method for teaching, dialogic pedagogy is important for orchestrating productive educational achievement. However, it is challenging to manipulate such pedagogy and thus there is the need for scalable professional development. This study initially incorporated a customised IMRT, which supports teachers to communicate with a virtual administrator, to generate comments and refinements for classroom dialogue in an immersive and tangible way. A quasi-experiment was conducted with 60 primary school teachers to test its effectiveness. This study discovered that teachers participating in the IMRT-based training tended to exhibit greater self-efficacy in enhancing dialogic pedagogy compared to those who engaged in traditional training methods. Furthermore, these teachers' practical competencies concerning dialogic pedagogy increased dramatically. Specifically, they gained greater proficiency in managing elaborated, coordinated, and speculative talk. Under their skilful initiation of dialogue, students were more inclined to justify ideas, seek connections, explore possibilities, and engage in constructive conversations. Moreover, findings indicated that more positive correlations between teachers’ self-efficacy and their actual practice in the IMRT-based training group, especially with regard to dialogues involving complex ways of thinking. This study offers valuable insights for technological integration and pedagogical improvement. It contributes to the viability of scalable teacher training and to helping in-service teachers with their professional growth.}

Although CGN is generally resistant to enzymatic digestion in mammalian gut, it can be degraded by the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the specific bacteria capable of degrading CGN—particularly the most commonly used form, kappa-CGN—remain uncharacterized. In this study, by using advanced culturomics approaches with chemically-defined CGN as growth substrate, we identified for the first time that Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides zhangwenhongii, and Bacteroides difficilis were functional species capable of actively degrading kappa-CGN in the mammalian gut. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the degradation products were composed mainly of disaccharides, tetrasaccharides, and hexasaccharides. Genomic analysis indicated that all three species harbored a plethora of carbohydrate-active enzymes. Among these, kappa-carrageenase and lambda-carrageenase were present in all three bacteria, while iota-carrageenase was detected only in B. xylanisolvens and B. zhangwenhongii. Our findings provide novel insights into microbial metabolism of CGN in the mammalian gut, thereby advancing the mechanistic understanding of its potential toxicological effects and informing the ongoing debate surrounding this ubiquitous food additive.}

Using an online questionnaire, we analysed factors such as students' field of study, gender differences, and the type of AI used. The questionnaire included statements categorised into thematic clusters, with responses measured on a five-point Likert scale. Statistical analysis, including chi-square tests and Cohen's d, revealed that individuals studying computer science, males, and supporters of generative AI are more likely to use AI tools for educational purposes. They perceive fewer barriers to the integration of AI into FL education. Social science students and women are less likely to use AI tools in FL education and express scepticism about their potential to improve academic outcomes. They tend to be more critical or cautious regarding the role of AI in FL education. They view AI as a valuable tool that enhances the learning experience but, at the same time, recognise the irreplaceable role of human teachers. The study highlights the need for targeted educational initiatives to address gender and disciplinary gaps in AI adoption, promote informed discussions on AI in education, and develop balanced AI integration strategies to improve FL learning. These findings suggest educators and policymakers should implement comprehensive AI training programs and ethical guidelines for responsible AI use in (FL) education.}

The difference in immunity of these two animals might be an obstacle to successful vaccine development. The protective immunity induced by LigAc was reported to be specific antibodies while T-cell-mediated immunity has never been investigated. We reported for the first time that hamsters and mice gave dissimilar T-cell responses. Mice and hamsters were divided into 3 groups: an adjuvant plus recombinant LigAc (rLigAc) immunized, an adjuvant-injected, and a negative control group. Immunizations were done three times at 2-week intervals. The rLigAc-specific IgG antibody titers in rLigAc immunized mice and hamsters were significantly higher than in the control groups but no significant difference between the animals. The percentages of hamster CD4+ T cells were significantly higher than those of mice. Mouse CD25+CD4+ T cells responded to rLigAc significantly higher than hamsters. Interestingly, the rLigAc significantly reduced the percentage of IFN-γ+CD4+ cells in mice (≅30 %) and more decrease (≅70 %) was found in hamsters. Remarkably, it also reduced considerably hamster IL-4+CD4+ T cells (≅80 %) but an extremely low decrease in mice (≅20 %).

This paper describes the adaptation of an evidence-based intervention for mental health, Self-Help Plus (SH+), to a digital platform, aiming to expand mental health support through innovative technological solutions. The SH+ intervention, designed by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a low-intensity, self-guided program aimed at improving mental well-being. The intervention has been integrated into a chatbot-driven mobile app called “ALBA” (Automated Well-Being Assistant).
Objective
This protocol describes the stages of transition (porting) from a traditional face-to-face, group-based approach to a tech-enabled model, tailored specifically for women with breast cancer and pregnant women. The adaptation of this approach is described, focusing on 2 key aspects: (1) the shift from in-person delivery to a tech-enabled intervention and (2) the customization of the intervention to address the unique needs of the selected target groups.
Methods
The development of the ALBA app involved a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach combining expertise in psychology, eHealth IT, interaction design, and specific domain knowledge related to pregnancy and oncology. The development process followed 2 primary methodologies: user-centered design and service design. These approaches emphasize understanding user needs, promoting iterative improvements, and continuously incorporating user feedback. The development followed the Obesity-Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model, which involves a cycle of literature review, stakeholder consultation, content development, software development, and evaluation. At the same time, specific attention was dedicated to (1) adapting the SH+ protocol to suit the chatbot-driven ALBA platform, (2) tailoring content to the target population, and (3) incorporating interactive features to improve engagement and potential efficacy.
Results
The manuscript outlines the key steps and processes involved in adapting the SH+ intervention into the ALBA digital platform. This includes an overview of the challenges and opportunities of translating a face-to-face, group-based intervention into a tech-enabled model and provides insight into how customization for specific populations, such as women with breast cancer and pregnant women, was integrated into the design of the platform. This is in view of informing future studies on the development and adaptation of already validated protocols into mobile health (mHealth) interventions in the field of mental health and mental well-being.
Conclusions
The digital adaptation of the SH+ intervention into the ALBA platform could represent a significant step forward in expanding the accessibility and personalization of mental health interventions in potentially different settings and target groups. The use of virtual coaching applications can play a central role in improving the availability and ease of access of psychological support, even in different and mHealth formats. Future developments could include further testing in real-world settings to expand (1) adaptations for various target groups and (2) the purpose of use to range from primary prevention to more clinically focused interventions.

The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA)
Study focus
TGRA faces increasing vulnerability to extreme precipitation events driven by complex convective weather systems. Radar echo extrapolation—predicting future precipitation patterns from current radar data—is essential for early warning systems but faces significant challenges in this topographically complex region. While data-driven approaches have advanced the field, current convolutional neural network-based diffusion models struggle with the TGRA's dynamic meteorological conditions due to their reliance on translational invariance, which often fails to capture rapid weather transitions in complex terrain.
New hydrogeological insights from the region
To address these limitations, we introduce RadarDiT, a Vision Transformer-based diffusion model specifically engineered for radar extrapolation in the TGRA. First, we develop a five-year radar dataset capturing diverse convective weather phenomena unique to this region. Then, leveraging this dataset, RadarDiT employs multi-layer Vision Transformers that effectively model global dependencies and complex spatial relationships, enabling accurate prediction of convective cell evolution. Our model demonstrates superior performance in maintaining strong echo and spatial coherence over longer forecast horizons. Quantitative evaluations across multiple metrics and thresholds confirm RadarDiT's enhanced skill in forecasting heavy precipitation events, with particular improvements in Critical Success Index at higher radar echo values. This work establishes a foundation for more reliable nowcasting systems in regions with complex terrain and dynamic weather patterns, directly supporting enhanced disaster preparedness and response strategies.}

abstract = {Background
Patients increasingly have direct access to their medical record. Radiology reports are complex and difficult for patients to understand and contextualize. One solution is to use large language models (LLMs) to translate reports into patient-accessible language. Objective This review summarizes the existing literature on using LLMs for the simplification of patient radiology reports. We also propose guidelines for best practices in future studies.
Evidence Acquisition
A systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Studies published and indexed using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to February 2025 were included. Inclusion criteria comprised of studies that used large language models for simplification of diagnostic or interventional radiology reports for patients and evaluated readability. Exclusion criteria included non-English manuscripts, abstracts, conference presentations, review articles, retracted articles, and studies that did not focus on report simplification. The Mixed Methods Appraisal tool (MMAT) 2018 was used for bias assessment. Given the diversity of results, studies were categorized based on reporting methods, and qualitative and quantitative findings were presented to summarize key insights.
Evidence Synthesis
A total of 2126 citations were identified and 17 were included in the qualitative analysis. 71% of studies utilized a single LLM, while 29% of studies utilized multiple LLMs. The most prevalent LLMs included ChatGPT, Google Bard/Gemini, Bing Chat, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot. All studies that assessed quantitative readability metrics (n=12) reported improvements. Assessment of simplified reports via qualitative methods demonstrated varied results with physician vs non-physician raters.
Conclusion and Clinical Impact
LLMs demonstrate the potential to enhance the accessibility of radiology reports for patients, but the literature is limited by heterogeneity of inputs, models, and evaluation metrics across existing studies. We propose a set of best practice guidelines to standardize future LLM research.}

Specifically, this research illustrates ChatGPT’s role as a secondary coder in deductive qualitative accounting research, analyzing interview transcripts using content analysis with a predefined coding scheme. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with 36 business economics students. First, the primary researcher manually analyzed the data using a deductive approach. Next, a second human researcher and ChatGPT (ChatGPT-4o Plus) were appointed as secondary coders to independently verify and validate the coding. The paper demonstrates ChatGPT’s potential to assist in coding interview transcripts, emphasizing its role as a supplementary tool in qualitative research. The coding results from both secondary coders were compared with those of the primary human coder, revealing over 99% agreement for both secondary coders. In addition, a step-by-step illustration, best practices, prompts, and critical reflections are shared.

abstract = {Background
Hepatitis A outbreaks in the United Kingdom are uncommon. Most people develop mild to moderate symptoms that resolve, without sequelae, within months. However, in high-risk groups, including those with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD), hepatitis A infection can be severe, with a higher risk of mortality and morbidity. The Health Security Agency and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence recommend preexposure hepatitis A vaccination given in 2 doses to people with CLD, regardless of its cause. There are currently no published reports of vaccination coverage for people with CLD in England or internationally.
Objective
This study aims to describe hepatitis A vaccination coverage in adults with CLD in a UK primary care setting and compare liver disease etiology, sociodemographic characteristics, and comorbidities in people who are and are not exposed to the hepatitis A vaccine.
Methods
We will conduct a retrospective cohort study with data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub database, which is nationally representative of the English population. We will include people aged 18 years and older who have been registered in general practices in the Research and Surveillance Centre network and have a record of CLD between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2022, including those with alcohol-related liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, nonalcohol fatty liver disease, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. We will carefully curate variables using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms. We will report the sociodemographic characteristics of those who are vaccinated. These include age, gender, ethnicity, population density, region, socioeconomic status (measured using the index of multiple deprivation), obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Hepatitis A vaccination coverage for 1 and 2 doses will be calculated using an estimate of the CLD population as the denominator. We will analyze the baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics, including measures of dispersion. Pairwise comparisons of case-mix characteristics, comorbidities, and complications will be reported according to vaccination status. A multistate survival model will be fitted to estimate the transition probabilities among four states: (1) diagnosed with CLD, (2) first dose of hepatitis A vaccination, (3) second dose of hepatitis A vaccination, and (4) death. This will identify any potential disparities in how people with CLD get vaccinated.
Results
The Research and Surveillance Centre population comprises over 8 million people. The reported incidence of CLD is 20.7 cases per 100,000. International estimates of hepatitis A vaccine coverage vary between 10% and 50% in this group.
Conclusions
This study will describe the uptake of the hepatitis A vaccine in people with CLD and report any disparities or differences in the characteristics of the vaccinated population.

abstract = {Background
Approximately 89% of the US population lives within five miles of a community pharmacy, which provides a network of geographically distributed recruitment nodes for testing and surveillance of infection and disease.
Objectives
Establish feasibility of Pharmacy-based Research Opportunities To Enhance Community Testing and Surveillance in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community pharmacy setting with University of Kentucky serving as the coordinating center and research hub for sample analysis.
Methods
Two community pharmacies in Kentucky served as community-based recruitment sites to assess SARS-CoV-2 exposure through longitudinal (5 visits over 56 days) collection of nasal swabs and blood samples from subjects.
Results
Fifty subjects were recruited between May 2022 and December 2023 for longitudinal sample collection. Three phases of recruitment were investigated by first establishing standard operating procedures in an urban pharmacy, then expanding recruitment at a second pharmacy in a rural setting, and finally increasing recruitment at the urban pharmacy. During the first phase of recruitment, 12 participants were recruited. Of these participants, two never scheduled a visit after the initial screening. The median time for study completion from first to last visit within this phase was 59 days (interquartile range: 56-68 days). During the second phase of recruitment, eight of nine participants completed all five visits. The median time to complete all visits was 105 days (interquartile range: 98-112 days). During the ongoing third phase, 29 subjects were recruited, and 19 participants completed all required visits and the remainder continue to schedule follow-up appointments.
Conclusion
Community pharmacies have a significant role in promoting public health. The geographic distribution of community pharmacies makes them appealing locations for recruitment of outpatient cohorts for local surveillance of infections and chronic inflammatory conditions with opportunities for broad implementation of this project for clinical trials in underserved communities.}

While conventional pH sensors are highly sensitive, they are often limited by challenges such as limited battery life and slower response rates. An innovative solution lies in triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology, which offers a sustainable, battery-free approach to pH detection. By harnessing mechanical energy and converting it into electrical energy, TENGs enable the development of self-powered sensors suitable for environmental applications. In this context, A nitrogen-rich polymer organic framework (POF) was synthesized based on porphine using pyrrole and tested its effectiveness in a TENG. The POF particles are used as the positive triboelectric layer and FEP as the negative triboelectric layer in the TENG fabrication process. The resulting POF-based TENG could generate 70 V voltage, 1.2 µA of current, and 5 µW of power. We also demonstrated that the TENG could charge capacitors and power LEDs. The study explored the operational mechanism of the TENG in harsh environmental conditions and how the POF material detects pH changes, confirming its efficiency in pH sensing. The research highlights the synthesis of the POF material, its use as a triboelectric layer, the fabrication process of the TENG, and its performance in energy harvesting and self-powered applications.}

While frailty has been largely studied in Alzheimer’s disease, few study focused on Lewy body dementia (LBD). Beyond frailty, the World Health Organization recently highlights the concept of intrinsic capacity (IC), offering a promising framework for the early identification and intervention to mitigate the risk of frailty and disability in older adults. IC refers to an individual's physical and mental abilities (including five dimensions: sensory, psychology, locomotion, vitality and cognition), which support the maintenance of functional capacity and promote healthy aging. In this review, we aimed to describe the prevalence of IC decline in LBD and its potential consequences. While few studies focused specifically on this question, we found evidence in the literature of a higher prevalence of IC decline in LBD, compared to cognitively unimpaired older adults and to Alzheimer’s disease patients. If future studies are needed to confirm these results, we assume that IC assessment and monitoring in LBD may be a further step towards a better integrated and personalized care for patients. This may open the avenue to develop specific tailored interventions, to decrease disability and increase quality of life and “healthy ageing” of patients despite the presence of LBD.}

The accumulation of vast electronic medical records (EMRs) through medical informatization creates significant research value, particularly in obstetrics. Diagnostic standardization across different health care institutions and regions is vital for medical data analysis. Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for various medical tasks. Prompt engineering is key to use LLMs effectively.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of LLMs with various prompt engineering techniques on the task of standardizing obstetric diagnostic terminology using real-world obstetric data.
Methods
The paper describes a 4-step approach used for mapping diagnoses in electronic medical records to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, observation domain. First, similarity measures were used for mapping the diagnoses. Second, candidate mapping terms were collected based on similarity scores above a threshold, to be used as the training data set. For generating optimal mapping terms, we used two LLMs (ChatGLM2 and Qwen-14B-Chat [QWEN]) for zero-shot learning in step 3. Finally, a performance comparison was conducted by using 3 pretrained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs), including BERT, whole word masking BERT, and momentum contrastive learning with BERT (MC-BERT), for unsupervised optimal mapping term generation in the fourth step.
Results
LLMs and BERT demonstrated comparable performance at their respective optimal levels. LLMs showed clear advantages in terms of performance and efficiency in unsupervised settings. Interestingly, the performance of the LLMs varied significantly across different prompt engineering setups. For instance, when applying the self-consistency approach in QWEN, the F1-score improved by 5%, with precision increasing by 7.9%, outperforming the zero-shot method. Likewise, ChatGLM2 delivered similar rates of accurately generated responses. During the analysis, the BERT series served as a comparative model with comparable results. Among the 3 models, MC-BERT demonstrated the highest level of performance. However, the differences among the versions of BERT in this study were relatively insignificant.
Conclusions
After applying LLMs to standardize diagnoses and designing 4 different prompts, we compared the results to those generated by the BERT model. Our findings indicate that QWEN prompts largely outperformed the other prompts, with precision comparable to that of the BERT model. These results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised approaches in improving the efficiency of aligning diagnostic terms in daily research and uncovering hidden information values in patient data.}

abstract = {Objective
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) contribute to maternal mortality and morbidity globally. Mobile health technologies may improve HDP management through patient education, facilitating patient-provider communication, and supporting blood pressure self-monitoring through tailored feedback and reminder prompts. Our objective was to understand the digital health needs of women with HDP from low-socioeconomic backgrounds.
Methods
An interactive HDP management digital prototype was developed and evaluated through usability and acceptability testing. Participants included nine pregnant or postpartum women with diagnosed HDP and three maternal-fetal medicine specialists, recruited from two clinics in a predominantly low-income city, Newark, N.J., in 2024 The Technology Acceptance Model was used to guide the assessment of the prototype's acceptability and usability. Data were collected from interviews, a digital literacy questionnaire, and a system usability questionnaire, with quantitative data analyzed descriptively and qualitative data through content analysis.
Results
The median gestational age among pregnant women was 22.0 (17.0, 29.0) weeks, with 89 % identifying as Black/African American. Most women (78 %) reported moderate or high digital health literacy. The mean System Usability score was 81 ± 17, indicating good usability. Three themes were identified: high acceptability and usability, the importance of tailored feedback, and the need for real-time provider-patient communication to support treatment decisions.
Conclusions
These findings indicate a high acceptability and usability of a digital application for HDP management and home blood pressure monitoring among pregnant and postpartum women diagnosed with HDP and their providers in a low-income urban setting.}

abstract = {Background
Fusion genes play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study investigated the utility of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ribonucleic acid (RNA) for detecting rare and unknown fusion genes in patients with AML.
Methods
A total of 85 adult AML samples previously identified as fusion gene-negative by multiplex nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were subjected to NGS analysis.
Results
Fusion genes were detected in 21 of 72 (29.2%) patients. Among the 26 primary refractory patients, 11 (42.3%) exhibited fusion genes, whereas among the 18 relapsed patients, fusion genes were identified in five (27.8%). Notably, KMT2A and NUP98 rearrangements were enriched in refractory/relapsed patients. Additionally, recurrent fusion transcripts involving EIF4A1 were observed. The identification of additional fusion genes resulted in an approximate 20.8% (11/53) reclassification of medium-risk karyotypes to the poor-risk category, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy.
Conclusions
Targeted NGS may complement conventional methods for identifying novel fusions in refractory/relapsed AML; however, its prognostic utility requires verification in controlled trials.}

keywords = {Tumor-associated macrophages, Macrophage activation, Tumor microenvironment, Molecular docking simulation},
abstract = {Background
Resting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are stimulated by the tumor microenvironment and can be primarily polarized into two subtypes: M1- and M2-like. M1-like TAMs promote inflammation and eradicate tumor cells, whereas M2-like TAMs suppress inflammation and facilitate tumor development. However, the mechanisms underlying phenotypic switching in these macrophages remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the gene expression profiles of M1-like and M2-like TAMs in pan cancers.
Methods
Three computational methods were used to estimate the infiltration score of TAMs in 9239 tumor samples across 31 solid cancer types, based on RNA sequencing databases. Tumor samples were divided into high- and low-score groups based on the median M1/M2 ratio. Furthermore, gene enrichment, protein interactions, and transcription factors were analyzed. Multiple pharmaco-omics profiles were used to identify potential drugs. Finally, binding between the compounds and drug targets was validated using molecular docking.
Results
Of the top 100 dysregulated genes in each cancer type, 70 and 82 genes with upregulated and downregulated expression, respectively, were consistently differentially expressed. We identified candidate drugs targeting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a core protein. These included efaproxiral, hesperidin, ezetimibe, calcitriol, and linopirdine.
Conclusions
This study provides a pan-cancer characterization of the TAM polarization-related gene profile. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses revealed five promising therapeutic agents for TAM reprogramming. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the enhancement of immune responses to inhibit tumor immune escape and metastasis.}

In other words, in such contributions, the main unknown parameters of the functional model and variance components are estimated sequentially while in our proposed approach, they are estimated simultaneously which leads to a more rigorous solution and also it can be considered as a standard method for VCE in the general nonlinear problems. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm does not require any linearization since here a metaheuristic based method is applied to the VCE problem for the first time. Grey Wolf optimization which is a swarm intelligence method was elected as an efficient simple tool for this goal which outperforms existing well-known metaheuristic methods in literature. The other interesting attainments of the proposed VCE method are that it performs better when the nonlinearity of the problem increases and it is less possible to reach negative variance components. Two geodetic examples demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides smaller mean squared error (MSE) than the traditional method.}

The study sample comprised 500 Chinese teachers. The results showed that professional identity was significantly and negatively associated with both teachers' turnover intentions and work alienation, while work alienation was significantly and positively related to teachers' turnover intentions. Moreover, work alienation mediated the relationship between professional identity and teachers' turnover intentions. Job autonomy not only moderated the relationship between professional identity and teachers' work alienation but also moderated the mediating role of work alienation in the relationship between professional identity and teachers' turnover intentions.

This study combines Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE), an imaging technique which provides spatially resolved deformation maps across the corneal volume, with Nanoindentation (NI), a technique that relies on direct force measurements at predefined locations on the cornea, to assess corneal biomechanics before and after CXL. Ten human donor corneas were incubated for 24 hours in a medium containing 15 % dextran to control hydration and thickness. A custom-made sample mount exerting adjustable retrocorneal fluid pressure enabled ex vivo characterization of the entire cornea while maintaining its natural shape and physiological tension. Each cornea was analyzed with both OCE and NI before and after standard Dresden protocol CXL. Linear mixed-effects models revealed significant CXL-induced stiffening across both methods, most pronounced in the central cornea and a decreasing peripherally. OCE showed a central reduction in axial strain () of 2.6 ‰ (p < 0.01), while NI revealed a consistent central increase in Hertz elastic modulus () of ∼ 14 kPa (p < 0.01) across both loading rates (300 and 600 μN / min). Although baseline stiffness increased with loading rate (128 kPa vs. 147 kPa), the CXL stiffening effect remained constant. Both techniques confirmed significant regional differences in the CXL response from central to peripheral (p < 0.05). This study provides spatially resolved, quantitative insight into corneal biomechanics using two fundamentally different mechanical testing modalities. The integration of imaging-based OCE with force-based NI establishes a robust experimental foundation for in silico numerical modeling, enabling CXL treatment optimization and predictive simulations.}

abstract = {Background
The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, particularly ChatGPT with GPT-4 (OpenAI), in assisting with medical diagnosis is an emerging research area. However, it is not yet clear how well AI chatbots can evaluate whether the final diagnosis is included in differential diagnosis lists.
Objective
This study aims to assess the capability of GPT-4 in identifying the final diagnosis from differential-diagnosis lists and to compare its performance with that of physicians for case report series.
Methods
We used a database of differential-diagnosis lists from case reports in the American Journal of Case Reports, corresponding to final diagnoses. These lists were generated by 3 AI systems: GPT-4, Google Bard (currently Google Gemini), and Large Language Models by Meta AI 2 (LLaMA2). The primary outcome was focused on whether GPT-4’s evaluations identified the final diagnosis within these lists. None of these AIs received additional medical training or reinforcement. For comparison, 2 independent physicians also evaluated the lists, with any inconsistencies resolved by another physician.
Results
The 3 AIs generated a total of 1176 differential diagnosis lists from 392 case descriptions. GPT-4’s evaluations concurred with those of the physicians in 966 out of 1176 lists (82.1%). The Cohen κ coefficient was 0.63 (95% CI 0.56-0.69), indicating a fair to good agreement between GPT-4 and the physicians’ evaluations.
Conclusions
GPT-4 demonstrated a fair to good agreement in identifying the final diagnosis from differential-diagnosis lists, comparable to physicians for case report series. Its ability to compare differential diagnosis lists with final diagnoses suggests its potential to aid clinical decision-making support through diagnostic feedback. While GPT-4 showed a fair to good agreement for evaluation, its application in real-world scenarios and further validation in diverse clinical environments are essential to fully understand its utility in the diagnostic process.}

abstract = {Background
Simulated electronic health records (EHRs) are used in structured teaching for health care students. This partly addresses inconsistent student exposure to EHRs while on clinical placements. However, simulated records are poor replacements for the complexity of data encountered in real EHRs. While routinely collected health care data are often used for research, secondary use does not include education. We are exploring the perceptions, governance, and ethics required to support the use of real patient records within teaching.
Objective
The aim of the study is to explore the perspectives of health care professionals regarding the use of real patient records to deliver interprofessional EHR education to undergraduate health care students.
Methods
We held 90-minute group discussions with 10 health care professionals from nursing, pharmacy, medicine, and allied health disciplines. We used the GRIPP2 (Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public 2) checklist for reporting Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement to present our reflections.
Results
There was consensus on the need to upskill health care students in the use of EHRs. Participants emphasized teaching general EHR competencies and transferable skills to overcome the diversity in EHR systems. They highlighted limitations in current teaching due to accessibility issues, disparities within clinical teaching, and curricular gaps on important topics such as clinical documentation and coding. Highlighted benefits of using real EHRs in teaching included learning from the complexities and inaccuracies of real patient data, grasping real-world time frames, and better appreciation of multidisciplinary interactions. Concerns included exposing individual clinicians to unfounded scrutiny and the potential consequences of incidental findings within EHRs. The ethical implications of overlooking perceived errors within EHRs versus the impracticality of acting on them were discussed. To mitigate concerns, it was suggested that data donors would provide informed consent ensuring they understand that they will not be recontacted should any such errors be found.
Conclusions
Innovative solutions are needed to realign health care education with clinical practice in rapidly evolving digital environments. Real patient records are optimal for teaching students to handle complex and abundant real-world data. Data within EHRs represent a wealth of clinical knowledge encompassing professional and personal experiences spanning the lifetimes of patients and their caregivers. Drawing experiences and events from real EHRs will prepare health care students to anticipate, confront, and manage real patients in a variety of real-life scenarios. Our reflections highlight the processes and safeguards to consider when using real patient records to deliver EHR education to health care students. These detailed reflections from discussions with health care professionals provide the grounds for a robust framework, with appropriate governance and consent in place to use real health data in training to support preparation for clinical practice.}

The application of large language models (LLMs) in analyzing expert textual online data is a topic of growing importance in computational linguistics and qualitative research within health care settings.
Objective
The objective of this study was to understand how LLMs can help analyze expert textual data. Topic modeling enables scaling the thematic analysis of content of a large corpus of data, but it still requires interpretation. We investigate the use of LLMs to help researchers scale this interpretation.
Methods
The primary methodological phases of this project were (1) collecting data representing posts to an online nurse forum, as well as cleaning and preprocessing the data; (2) using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to derive topics; (3) using human categorization for topic modeling; and (4) using LLMs to complement and scale the interpretation of thematic analysis. The purpose is to compare the outcomes of human interpretation with those derived from LLMs.
Results
There is substantial agreement (247/310, 80%) between LLM and human interpretation. For two-thirds of the topics, human evaluation and LLMs agree on alignment and convergence of themes. Furthermore, LLM subthemes offer depth of analysis within LDA topics, providing detailed explanations that align with and build upon established human themes. Nonetheless, LLMs identify coherence and complementarity where human evaluation does not.
Conclusions
LLMs enable the automation of the interpretation task in qualitative research. There are challenges in the use of LLMs for evaluation of the resulting themes.}

This comprehensive, question-and-answer formatted review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of NP and VAP, with a focus on multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Key distinctions between NP and VAP are explored in terms of microbiological profiles, diagnostic approaches, and therapeutic implications. The review provides a detailed analysis of risk factors for MDROs – including prolonged mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic exposure, and host-related immunosuppression – emphasizing the importance of risk stratification in guiding empirical antibiotic selection. A critical appraisal of international guideline recommendations (IDSA/ATS, ERS, SEPAR) highlights areas of consensus and divergence, particularly regarding empirical treatment strategies and the role of narrow- versus broad-spectrum coverage. The integration of rapid molecular diagnostic tools, such as multiplex PCR, is discussed in depth, including their potential to improve diagnostic yield, facilitate early de-escalation, and enhance antimicrobial stewardship. Recent advances in antimicrobial development are reviewed, covering novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations and siderophore cephalosporins with activity against ESBL−, KPC−, and carbapenemase-producing pathogens. Their appropriate use in critically ill patients is contextualized within the framework of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic optimization. Finally, the review examines current evidence on treatment duration, supporting a 7–8 day course in most cases, with individualized extension in selected high-risk populations. The utility of procalcitonin as a biomarker to guide antibiotic discontinuation is also addressed. This review provides clinicians with a concise, evidence-based reference to inform the complex decision-making required in managing nosocomial pneumonia in the era of antimicrobial resistance.
Resumen
La neumonía nosocomial (NN), incluyendo su subtipo la neumonía asociada a ventilación mecánica (NAVM), constituye una de las principales causas de morbilidad, mortalidad y aumento de los costes sanitarios en pacientes hospitalizados, especialmente en unidades de cuidados intensivos. Esta revisión, presentada en un formato de preguntas y respuestas, sintetiza la evidencia actual sobre la epidemiología, fisiopatología y manejo de la NN y la NAVM, con especial atención a los patógenos multirresistentes (PMR). Se analizan las diferencias clave entre la NN y la NAVM en cuanto a perfil microbiológico, estrategias diagnósticas e implicaciones terapéuticas. Se detallan los principales factores de riesgo para infecciones por PMR—como la ventilación prolongada, la exposición previa a antibióticos y la inmunosupresión—, destacando la necesidad de una estratificación individualizada del riesgo para guiar el tratamiento empírico. Se revisan críticamente las recomendaciones de las principales guías internacionales (IDSA/ATS, ERS, SEPAR), resaltando coincidencias y discrepancias, especialmente en cuanto al uso de tratamientos empíricos de amplio o estrecho espectro. Asimismo, se discute el papel de las técnicas diagnósticas moleculares rápidas, como la PCR múltiple, en la mejora del rendimiento diagnóstico y la optimización del uso de antimicrobianos. Se incluye un análisis actualizado de los nuevos antibióticos disponibles frente a PMR, contextualizado en pacientes críticos, y se revisa la evidencia que respalda pautas abreviadas de 7-8 días en pacientes con buena evolución clínica. Finalmente, se aborda la utilidad de la procalcitonina como biomarcador para orientar la suspensión del tratamiento antibiótico.}

This study aims to create a complete Medication Error (ME) dataset. This will help to address the challenge of limited access to real-world data for developing machine learning models in healthcare applications.
Methods:
We use transformer-based models (GPT-4, LLAMA3, and Mistral) to create our synthetic dataset in French. These models generate a diverse range of descriptions that capture the variability of ME types. We assess the effectiveness of our synthetic dataset through expert evaluations by healthcare professionals and an AI-driven analysis, to test its realism and its utility in training machine learning models for ME classification.
Results:
The synthetic dataset demonstrates high accuracy and realism in representing diverse ME scenarios. Expert evaluation confirms that the dataset is similar to real-world ME data. The AI-driven evaluation also shows that models trained on synthetic data achieved robust classification performance, validating the dataset’s utility for the development of effective ME classification tools.
Conclusion:
The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of large language models to generate realistic synthetic ME reports in French. Out of 200 evaluated reports, 70% of zero-shot outputs were deemed below expectations, while 80% of one-shot and few-shot outputs were considered valid or valid with minor revisions by clinical experts. Furthermore, classifiers trained on 800 synthetic reports attained an F1-score of up to 0.78 when tested on real data. These results confirm that synthetic data can effectively support AI-driven ME analysis in contexts where real-world data is limited or unavailable.}

abstract = {Several strategies have emerged lately in response to the rapid increase in the aging population to enhance health and life span and manage aging challenges. Developing such strategies is imperative and requires an assessment of biological aging. Several aging clocks have recently been developed to measure biological aging and to assess the efficacy of longevity interventions. Biological age better reflects a person’s actual age and is closely associated with health outcomes and time to mortality. Traditionally, most aging clocks assume that biological changes occur linearly over time. However, age-related changes do not necessarily follow a linear trajectory. Thus, “Deep Aging Clocks” have been developed to overcome previous clocks' limitations and better capture subtle changes that occur during aging. Here, we summarize the current deep aging clocks, including epigenetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, microbiome, and imaging based clocks for age prediction. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing deep learning techniques, have significantly enhanced the prediction of biological aging, and this would help improve aging clocks and accelerate efforts to reach longer and healthier lives.}

abstract = {Background
Rapid on-site detection of infectious diseases is considerably essential for preventing and controlling major epidemics and maintaining social and public safety. However, the complexity of the natural environment in which infectious disease pathogens exist severely disrupts the performance of on-site detection, and rapid detection can become meaningless because of the cumbersome sample pretreatment process.
Result
Herein, a new detection platform based on a carbon sphere@Fe3O4 micromotor (CS@Fe3O4) in combination with a graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) was designed and used for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pathogens. The CS@Fe3O4 micromotor, surface-modified with anti-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antibody, could move at a velocity of 79.4 μm/s in a solution containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and exhibited capture rates of 67.9% and 36.2% for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and soil solutions, respectively. After magnetic field separation, the captured micromotor was used for GFET detection, with detection limits of 4.6 and 15.6 ag/mL in PBS and soil solutions, respectively.
Significance and novelty
This detection platform can be employed to avoid complex sample pretreatment procedures and achieve rapid on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pathogens in complex environments. This study introduces a novel approach for the on-site detection of infectious diseases.}

abstract = {Q-learning, as a well-known Reinforcement Learning algorithm, is prone to overestimation of action values. Such an overestimation is mainly due to the use of the maximization operator when updating the Q function. Deep Q Networks (DQN) suffer from the same issue, which is further aggravated by the noisy learning environment, leading to degradation of performance. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach called VQ-learning, which addresses the overestimation issue, along with its deep learning extension, Deep VQ-Networks (DVQN). VQ-learning incorporates a state value function V and an action value function Q, both V and Q function are updated without using the maximization operator. While various methods have been developed to mitigate overestimation, we demonstrate that VQ-learning achieves superior performance. Even in situations where the maximization operator does not lead to overestimation bias, VQ-learning still remains the best sample efficiency, matching the performance of Expected SARSA while requiring lower computational cost. Furthermore, as the size of the action space increases, VQ-learning consistently maintains robust learning efficiency compared to baseline methods. We evaluate DVQN across ten Atari game domains and demonstrate that it delivers performance that is either superior to or comparable with Deep Q Networks, Deep SARSA, Deep Double Q Networks, Clipped Deep Double Q Networks, Averaged DQN, and Dueling DQN, both in terms of reward outcomes and sample efficiency.}

Identifying biomarkers to anticipate BCG failure is a current clinical priority to improve patient stratification and enable risk-adapted, bladder-sparing interventions. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 48 patients with histologically confirmed pT1 NMIBC treated with standard intravesical BCG at two tertiary centers. The median age was 67 years (range: 41–93), 79.2 % were male, 81.2 % had high-grade tumors, 70.8 % had multifocal lesions, and 75.0 % presented tumors > 3 cm. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were obtained prior to BCG and, when available, at recurrence or progression. Immunohistochemical expression of HER-2, SERBP1, HABP4, and IFN-γ was quantified using semi-quantitative scoring and H-scores. Associations with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox regression. HER-2 and SERBP1 were significantly overexpressed in BCG-refractory tumors, with high immunorectivities conferring markedly reduced RFS (HER-2: 7.78 vs. 11.71 months, p < 0.001; SERBP1: 7.64 vs. 11.52 months, p < 0.0001) and inferior PFS (p < 0.05). In contrast, high HABP4 and IFN-γ immunorectivities were strongly associated with sustained recurrence- and progression-free survival (both p < 0.0001). Hazard ratios for recurrence and progression exceeded 5.0 for HER-2/SERBP1-high and IFN-γ/HABP4-low profiles. These findings define two molecular phenotypes—immune-evasive versus immune-active—that may inform precision risk stratification, early intervention, and personalized therapeutic decision-making in high-risk NMIBC.}

Digital tools could assist obstetric providers by delivering information given increasing options for fetal aneuploidy screening.
Purpose
To determine the impact of a chatbot for pre-test education and counseling in low-risk pregnancies.
Methods
Two sites participated in this randomized controlled trial. Patients in the intervention group used a chatbot prior to the provider visit, while patients in the control group only received education by the provider. The primary outcome was change in patient knowledge scores after provider education. Analysis was by intention to treat.
Results
Overall, 258 women participated (n = 130; intervention and n = 128; control). Knowledge gain was significantly higher among patients using the chatbot (mean increase in correct answers [out of 20]: +4.1 vs +1.9, p < 0.001). Both groups reported high satisfaction, with no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups (mean patient satisfaction [1–10]: 8.2 vs 8.5 respectively, p = 0.35). Providers also reported high satisfaction scores with no significant difference between intervention and control groups (mean provider satisfaction [1 − 10]: 8.7 vs 8.4 respectively, p = 0.13).
Conclusions
Pre-test education via a chatbot can increase patient knowledge of prenatal testing choices, with high patient and provider satisfaction.}

The concept of a medical “digital twin” has recently become popular to designate digital representations of patients as a support for a wide range of data science applications. However, the concept is ambiguous when it comes to practical implementations. Here, we propose a medical digital twin framework with a data-centric approach. We argue that a single digital representation of patients cannot support all the data uses of digital twins for technical and regulatory reasons. Instead, we propose a data architecture leveraging three main families of digital representations: (1) multimodal dashboards integrating various raw health records at points of care to assist with perception and documentation, (2) virtual patients, which provide nonsensitive data for collective secondary uses, and (3) individual predictions that support clinical decisions. For a given patient, multiple digital representations may be generated according to the different clinical pathways the patient goes through, each tailored to balance the trade-offs associated with the respective intended uses. Therefore, our proposed framework conceives the medical digital twin as a data architecture leveraging several digital representations of patients along clinical pathways.}

However, little is known about the opinions of persons who have used LLMs for mental health-related problems. Thus, the current work investigated the positive and negative experiences of those who have interacted with ChatGPT for their mental health using posts from relevant Reddit threads (N = 1,594). A 33-item coding scheme was applied to code the presence/absence of each item, and coded posts were modeled using an Ising network graph to explore pairwise and groupwise thematic associations of items. Results from the qualitative coding indicated that the codes representing positive sentiment, experiencing affect/emotion, and attaining personal benefit from using ChatGPT for therapy were among the most frequently coded. Moreover, the Ising network model revealed the most important associations were between items representing positive experiences with ChatGPT (e.g., it performs better than a human therapist in some way and is empathetic), negative experiences (e.g., restrictions worsened their mental health), and specific pathologies (e.g., used it for both anxiety and stress). In addition, the node representing ChatGPT as functioning well as a therapist was the most central node in the network Taken together, the current study indicates that, while users endorse several benefits from using ChatGPT for their mental health, they also report significant drawbacks, including restrictions by ChatGPT that can harm them or exacerbate their symptoms. Thus, ChatGPT may be a useful tool for persons not able to receive standard care, but it may not be as beneficial for persons with more severe pathologies or mental health concerns.}

abstract = {Background
While the advantages of using the internet and social media for research recruitment are well documented, the evolving online environment also enhances motivations for misrepresentation to receive incentives or to “troll” research studies. Such fraudulent assaults can compromise data integrity, with substantial losses in project time; money; and especially for vulnerable populations, research trust. With the rapid advent of new technology and ever-evolving social media platforms, it has become easier for misrepresentation to occur within online data collection. This perpetuation can occur by bots or individuals with malintent, but careful planning can help aid in filtering out fraudulent data.
Objective
Using an example with urban American Indian and Alaska Native young women, this paper aims to describe PRIOR (Protocol for Increasing Data Integrity in Online Research), which is a 2-step integration protocol for combating fraudulent participation in online survey research.
Methods
From February 2019 to August 2020, we recruited participants for formative research preparatory to an online randomized control trial of a preconceptual health program. First, we described our initial protocol for preventing fraudulent participation, which proved to be unsuccessful. Then, we described modifications we made in May 2020 to improve the protocol performance and the creation of PRIOR. Changes included transferring data collection platforms, collecting embedded geospatial variables, enabling timing features within the screening survey, creating URL links for each method or platform of data collection, and manually confirming potentially eligible participants’ identifying information.
Results
Before the implementation of PRIOR, the project experienced substantial fraudulent attempts at study enrollment, with less than 1% (n=6) of 1300 screened participants being identified as truly eligible. With the modified protocol, of the 461 individuals who completed a screening survey, 381 did not meet the eligibility criteria assessed on the survey. Of the 80 that did, 25 (31%) were identified as ineligible via PRIOR. A total of 55 (69%) were identified as eligible and verified in the protocol and were enrolled in the formative study.
Conclusions
Fraudulent surveys compromise study integrity, validity of the data, and trust among participant populations. They also deplete scarce research resources including respondent compensation and personnel time. Our approach of PRIOR to prevent online misrepresentation in data was successful. This paper reviews key elements regarding fraudulent data participation in online research and demonstrates why enhanced protocols to prevent fraudulent data collection are crucial for building trust with vulnerable populations.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a common surgical substrate in adult epilepsy surgery cohorts but variably reported in various pediatric cohorts.
Objective
We aimed to study the epilepsy phenotype, radiological and pathological variability, seizure and neurocognitive outcomes in children with drug-resistant epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) with or without additional subtle signal changes in anterior temporal lobe who underwent surgery.
Methods
This retrospective study enrolled children with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis with or without additional subtle T2-Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAR)/Proton Density (PD) signal changes in anterior temporal lobe who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy. Their clinical, EEG, neuropsychological, radiological and pathological data were reviewed and summarized.
Results
Thirty-six eligible patients were identified. The mean age at seizure onset was 3.7 years; 25% had daily seizures at time of surgery. Isolated HS was noted in 22 (61.1%) cases and additional subtle signal changes in ipsilateral temporal lobe in 14 (38.9%) cases. Compared to the normative population, the group mean performance in intellectual functioning and most auditory and visual memory tasks were significantly lower than the normative sample. The mean age at surgery was 12.3 years; 22 patients (61.1%) had left hemispheric surgeries. ILAE class 1 outcomes was seen in 28 (77.8%) patients after a mean follow up duration of 2.3 years. Hippocampal sclerosis was noted pathologically in 32 (88.9%) cases; type 2 (54.5%) was predominant subtype where further classification was possible. Additional pathological abnormalities were seen in 11 cases (30.6%); these had had similar rates of seizure freedom as compared to children with isolated hippocampal sclerosis/gliosis (63.6% vs 84%, p=0.21). Significant reliable changes were observed across auditory and visual memory tasks at an individual level post surgery.
Conclusions
Favourable seizure outcomes were seen in most children with isolated radiological hippocampal sclerosis. Patients with additional pathological abnormalities had similar rates of seizure freedom as compared to children with isolated hippocampal sclerosis/gliosis.}

abstract = {Objectives
In field hockey, there is limited information regarding lower extremity (LE) injury prevention screening protocols. To help inform the design of field hockey LE injury prevention screening protocols, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether static and dynamic single-leg balance (SLB), single-leg hop (SLH), and agility running tasks with unilateral limb-loading bias capture similar or different aspects of LE motor performance.
Design
Cross-sectional.
Setting
Indoor training facility.
Participants
Thirty adult female players.
Main outcome measures
For the right and left LE, Pearson's correlations (r) and the coefficient of determination (r2) assessed between-task relationships and shared variance, respectively, for: eyes-closed SLB, Star Excursion Balance Test – anterior reach, triple-hop-for-distance, 6-m-hop-for-time, modified pro-agility test.
Results
Across all correlations, 50% were not statistically-significant. Statistically-significant (P < 0.05) relationships were returned for the right LE (r = −0.69 to 0.42, r2 = 0.17 to 0.48) and left LE (r = −0.62 to 0.53, r2 = 0.17 to 0.38). Overall, between-task shared variance was ≤48.0%.
Conclusions
Because between-task shared variance was ≤48.0%, static and dynamic SLB, SLH, and agility running tasks with unilateral limb-loading bias each assess different aspects of LE motor performance. Therefore, practitioners should incorporate a range of LE motor performance tasks when designing field hockey LE injury prevention screening protocols.}

Recent studies have shown a growing concern regarding the cost-effectiveness and the lack of supporting data for the biologic agents that are being increasingly used in the orthopedic field. Our aim was to conduct a systematic scoping review of recent publications (last five years) on the use of orthobiologics to treat fracture non-union and summarize the latest available data.
Patients and methods
The inclusion criteria for this review were articles published in English, from 2016 to 2022, and focusing on the use of orthobiologics for the surgical treatment of non-union. Searches were conducted in March 2023 using Pubmed/MEDLINE and Embase. Studies on spinal fusion or gene therapy were excluded. Reviews, case reports with five cases or less, conference proceedings, preliminary reports, pediatric or non-human studies were excluded as well.
Results
The search found 1807 articles, 15 were eligible after PRISMA checklist and exclusions. The evidence was heterogenous and there was only one level II RCT. Recent data suggests that bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2) products could be effective for septic and aseptic tibial non-unions. However, the evidence was not conclusive regarding BMP-7, plasma rich platelets (PRP), stem cells or demineralized bone matrix (DBM).
Discussion
Every non-union case is different in terms of bone defect, biology, mechanical stability, surgical technique and host factors, which contributes to the conflicting reports on the efficacy of orthobiologics in the literature. We might never see a level 1, high powered and robust study defining the efficacy, safety profile and cost-effectiveness of such products.

The radiation of angiosperms is marked by a phenomenal diversity of floral size, shape, color, scent, and reward.1,2,3,4 The multi-dimensional response to selection to optimize pollination has generated correlated suites of these floral traits across distantly related species, known as “pollination syndromes.”5,6,7,8,9 The ability to test the broad utility of pollination syndromes and expand upon the generalities of these syndromes is constrained by limited trait data, creating a need for new approaches that can integrate vast, unstructured records from community-science platforms. Here, we compile the largest North American flower color dataset to date, using GPT-4 with Vision to classify color in over 11,000 species across more than 1.6 million iNaturalist observations. We discover that red- and orange-flowering species (classic “hummingbird pollination” colors) bloom later in eastern North America compared with other colors, corresponding to the arrival of migratory hummingbirds. Our findings reveal how seasonal flowering phenology, in addition to floral color and morphology, can contribute to the hummingbird pollination syndrome in regions where these pollinators are migratory. Our results highlight phenology as an underappreciated dimension of pollination syndromes and underscore the utility of integrating artificial intelligence with community-science data. The potential breadth of analysis offered by community-science datasets, combined with emerging data extraction techniques, could accelerate discoveries about the evolutionary and ecological drivers of biological diversity.}

abstract = {Background
The Patient Protection US Affordable Care Act (ACA) energy posting mandate requires restaurant chains to disclose information on the energy content of their food items. Assessments of the effect of menu energy labeling on dietary choices have reported inconsistent findings.
Objectives
This study examined the impact of menu energy labeling on food items purchased by college students after the mandate was enacted nationally.
Methods
Student food sales data from purchases made at 3 fast-food restaurants during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 academic years at a university campus were used for the analysis. The total sample included 1662 students on the university meal plan; these students generated 145,295 food transactions at the restaurants over the study period. We utilized a difference-in-differences (DiD) empirical strategy, comparing changes in transaction-level energy purchases at 2 fast-food restaurants B and C (FFRB and FFRC – treatment groups) that posted energy information in the summer of 2018 with another fast-food restaurant A (FFRA – control group) that began posting energy information before the study period.
Results
We observed increases in the mean energy content per transaction after implementing the menu-labeling policy. The DiD estimates found an increase of 20.6 in the mean calories of energy purchased per transaction at the treatment restaurants relative to the control restaurant. In the subgroup analyses, the DiD estimates indicated calories of energy increased: 18.7 for female students, 20.5 for male students, 23.5 for non-Hispanic Black students, 30.2 for students eligible for federal financial aid, and 19.9 for students not eligible for federal financial aid.
Conclusions
The results suggest that the ACA energy menu-labeling policy led to an increase in the energy content per transaction by students at a public university. This paper highlights the need for more research to better understand the determinants of food choice among college students.}

Artificial intelligence tools such as virtual agents (VAs) and chatbots allow retailers to tailor services and strengthen customer interaction. This study investigates the primary factors shaping customer intentions to use and collaborate with virtual agents, with particular attention to the moderating effect of service task type – support, purchase or complaint.
Design/methodology/approach
This study empirically tests a model in which perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitude toward virtual agents (antecedents) influence intention to use and willingness to collaborate (outcomes), with service task type assessed as a moderating variable. The model is evaluated using PLS-SEM based on survey data from 691 service customers.
Findings
The results indicate that (1) perceived usefulness, compared to ease of use, is a stronger antecedent of attitude; (2) attitude significantly influences intention to use and willingness to collaborate with virtual agents; (3) attitude functions as a significant mediator between perceived usefulness and intention to use. In addition, the study establishes that service task type – support, purchase or complaint – acts as a significant moderating factor.
Practical implications
This study shows that customers’ intentions to use and interact with virtual agents are mainly shaped by their attitudes and perceived usefulness, with the type of service task performed acting as a relevant contextual factor.
Originality/value
This study makes a distinct contribution by identifying the significant moderating role of customer service tasks in transforming customer attitudes into intentions to adopt virtual agents, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving VA adoption in retail and service settings.}

Hybrid bonding, a key process in 3D IC packaging, enables high-density interconnections between stacked chips but faces fabrication challenges as the pitch continues to scale down. This study explores the use of nanotwinned Cu (NT-Cu) to enhance hybrid bonding. The thermal expansion of NT-Cu pads in SiO2 vias and the effects of downscaling pad size on expansion behaviors were investigated using in-situ heating atomic force microscopy (AFM). At 200 °C, the 3-μm regular Cu pad expanded uniformly by 3.9 nm, while the 3-μm NT-Cu pads exhibited uneven expansion, with the periphery expanding by 11.7 nm and the center expanding by 2.6 nm. Despite the uneven expansion, the enhanced expansion in the 3-μm NT-Cu pad is beneficial for broadening the process window for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and hybrid bonding processes. Grain-boundary diffusion was identified as the underlying mechanism behind this behavior. Finally, successful bonding with NT-Cu/SiO2 vias at a low temperature of 200 °C demonstrates their potential for fine-pitch hybrid bonding.}

In this paper, we argue that a “digital determinants of health” (DDoH) framework for understanding the intersections of health outcomes, technology, and training is critical to the development of comprehensive digital health competencies in medical education. Much like current social determinants of health models, the DDoH framework can be integrated into undergraduate, graduate, and professional education to guide training interventions as well as competency development and evaluation. We provide possible approaches to integrating this framework into training programs and explore priorities for future research in digitally-competent medical education.}

Road safety offences are the most prevalent in Spain. Although the most serious offences carry prison sentences, the vast majority of road offences are associated with alternative penalties, such as the community service order, where the perpetrators serve their sentences mainly in workshops for reintegration and road re-education, known as TASEVAL. The purpose of this research is to identify which are the most common criminal behaviours behind the wheel and to determine the direction in which recidivism is heading in order to provide valid information with which to improve the existing correctional programmes employed in Spain and, in turn, in other countries. Our findings are based on a sample of 20,260 TASEVAL road safety training course attendees and their recidivism over the following four years. The principal takeaway was that the most common and concerning repeated behaviours are related to driving under the effects of alcohol or drugs and driving without a licence, establishing clear criminal pattern, with the latter being the most frequent type of recidivism. It is of utmost importance to understand the reasons for these recidivist profiles so that reintegration measures can be targeted directly at the source of the problem and thus be more effective, which will help to minimise both recidivism and the number of road crashes.}

abstract = {Objective
Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) in medicine has become a prominent topic of discussion due to the rapid improvement of these tools in understanding and responding to natural language. Several models are widely available to the public, both proprietary and open-sourced. We aim to evaluate the possible use of such LLMs in vascular surgery by understanding their abilities to process common consult requests.
Methods
The senior author created 25 fictional vascular surgery consultation queries based on common consultation requests. Five attending surgeons and four LLMs (GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Bard, and Falcon 40B) were asked to answer whether each consult was an emergency that needed immediate attention within an hour. Responders were also asked whether the next best step was an examination, additional imaging, or an urgent operation. GPT 3.5 and 4 also provided free-response answers on the next best step, graded by attending surgeons based on scientific accuracy, possible harm, and content completeness.
Results
The rates of accurate emergency identification were 88%, 100%, 76%, and 88% for GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Falcon 40B, and Bard, respectively. Although they have similar overall accuracy, GPT 3.5 has a high sensitivity at 100%, whereas Bard has a high specificity at 90%. GPT 4.0 had 100% sensitivity and specificity. LLMs agreed with the majority surgeon opinion on the next best step in 64% (GPT 3.5), 32% (GPT 4), 68% (Falcon 40B), and 36% (Bard) of cases. GPT 3.5 and 4 had a collective ratio of 89.5% of answers adhering to the scientific consensus. Only 5% of responses were highly likely to cause clinically significant harm. Although only 4% included incorrect content, 17.5% of answers missed important content. There was no significant difference between GPT 3.5 and 4 regarding the free-response grade.
Conclusions
Existing, widely available LLMs exhibited a solid ability to identify vascular emergencies, with GPT 4.0 agreeing with surgeon attendings in 100% of cases. However, these models continue to have identifiable deficiencies in treatment recommendations, a higher-level task. Future models might help triage incoming consults and provide preliminary management suggestions. The utility of such tools in clinical practice remains to be explored.}

In UAV aerial imagery, acquiring meaningful image representations plays a crucial role in scene classification. Prior techniques to the scene classification procedure rely on feature coding techniques with lower-level unsupervised feature learning or hand-engineered features. As the number of UAVs improves, clustering is important and required to give scalability because clustering systems guarantee the primary level of system performance like energy efficiency (EE). Recently, deep learning (DL) has depended on methods that is used for scene classification models captured by UAVs. In this manuscript, an Energy-Aware Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Assisted Mobile Multimedia Communication via Metaheuristic Optimization (EAUAV-MCMO) technique is proposed. The major intention of the EAUAV-MCMO technique is to present an effective model for energy-aware dynamic resource allocation in UAV networks using advanced techniques. Initially, the chimp optimization algorithm (ChOA) model is used for clustering process which comprises five cluster fitness functions (FF) such as intra-cluster distance, UAV nodes, cluster node (CN) density, distance from CHs to sink, and EE. For scene classification, the VGG16 technique is employed for feature extraction. Furthermore, the stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) technique is implemented for classification. Finally, the slime mold algorithm (SMA) adjusts the parameter tuning of the SDAE technique and results in superior classification results. The efficacy of the EAUAV-MCMO approach is examined under the UC Merced Land Use dataset. The comparison study of the EAUAV-MCMO approach illustrated a superior accuracy value of 99.37 % over existing methods.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in most countries; however, few specific political actions have been implemented to improve cardiovascular health at both national and international levels. We aimed to describe the methodology used for the development and initial rollout of Spain's Cardiovascular Health Strategy of the National Health System (ESCAV, Estrategia en Salud Cardiovascular del Sistema Nacional de Salud).
Methods
A multidisciplinary team comprising diverse stakeholders developed a national strategy to reduce the burden of CVD in Spain. The team used qualitative methodologies to identify and select priorities and design strategic map models.
Results
The strategy was structured around a matrix with 6 cross-cutting themes (citizen empowerment; health promotion, prevention, and early CVD detection; comprehensive management of acute and chronic CVD; health care coordination; equity; and knowledge management) and 4 longitudinal lines (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and valve disease). The framework was further supported by 3 overarching axes: continuity of care, patient safety, and leveraging of information systems. A total of 27 critical points were selected, leading to the definition of 99 strategic objectives (32 general and 67 specific) and 136 actions through iterative reviews and prioritization. Strategic maps were developed for the overall strategy and for each action line, incorporating 61 indicators to facilitate and monitor the development of the strategy.
Conclusions
ESCAV represents one of the most ambitious initiatives aimed at transforming a nation's cardiovascular health. The methods and steps undertaken in this process could serve as a valuable reference for other countries seeking to establish similar initiatives. Furthermore, it may act as a catalyst to advance efforts toward establishing a European plan for cardiovascular health.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Aunque las enfermedades cardiovasculares (ECV) siguen siendo la principal causa de muerte en la mayoría de los países, se han implementado pocas acciones políticas específicas para aumentar la salud cardiovascular de alcance nacional o internacional. Nuestro objetivo es describir la metodología utilizada para el desarrollo y el despliegue inicial de la Estrategia en Salud Cardiovascular del Sistema Nacional de Salud (ESCAV) de España.
Métodos
Un equipo multidisciplinario con todas las partes interesadas desarrolló una estrategia para reducir la carga de ECV en España utilizando métodos cualitativos para identificar y seleccionar prioridades y modelos de mapas estratégicos.
Resultados
En una matriz compuesta por 6 temas transversales (empoderamiento ciudadano; promoción de salud y prevención y detección precoz de ECV; abordaje integral de la ECV aguda y crónica; coordinación asistencial; equidad, y gestión del conocimiento) y 4 líneas longitudinales (cardiopatía isquémica, insuficiencia cardiaca, arritmias y valvulopatías) con 3 ejes generales: continuidad asistencial, seguridad del paciente y sistemas de información, se seleccionaron 27 puntos críticos, 99 objetivos estratégicos y 136 acciones. Se crearon mapas estratégicos para la estrategia completa y para cada acción, con 61 indicadores para supervisar su desarrollo.
Conclusiones
La ESCAV es una de las iniciativas más ambiciosas para cambiar la salud cardiovascular de un país. Los pasos dados y los métodos utilizados para su desarrollo pueden ser de ayuda para otros países dispuestos a avanzar en esta dirección y un incentivo en la lucha por tener un plan europeo sobre salud cardiovascular.}

The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanism of melatonin on cholestatic liver injury. C57BL/6 J mice were fed with 0.05 % 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-collidine (DDC) diet to induce cholestatic liver injury, with or without daily intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg melatonin. The supplementation of melatonin alleviated cholestatic liver injury through improving liver histopathology and abnormal serum indicators reflecting liver function. Meanwhile, melatonin treatment inhibited the hepatic inflammatory infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, liver fibrosis caused by cholestasis was mitigated by melatonin via reducing collagen deposition and pro-fibrogenic factors. Furthermore, the gut microbiota dysbiosis and impaired intestinal barrier induced by DDC were mitigated after melatonin treatment. Notably, melatonin activated the cholangiocyte nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) / heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signalling pathway through melatonin receptor 1 A (MTNR1A) to protect the liver from oxidative stress damage. In conclusion, melatonin is a potential therapeutic agent for cholestatic liver injury, possibly acting by modulating gut microbiota and activating the NRF2/HO1 pathway.}

Data sharing in healthcare is vital for advancing research and personalized medicine. However, the process is hindered by privacy, ethical, and legal challenges associated with patient data. Synthetic data generation emerges as a promising solution, replicating statistical properties of real data while enhancing privacy protection.
Methods:
This systematic review examines deep learning techniques for synthetic data generation in healthcare, focusing on their ability to maintain data utility and enhance privacy. Studies from Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and IEEE databases published between 2019 and 2023 were analyzed. Key methods explored include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models. Evaluation metrics encompass data resemblance, utility, and privacy preservation, with special attention to privacy-enhancing methods like differential privacy and federated learning.
Results:
GANs and VAEs demonstrated robust capabilities in generating realistic synthetic data for tabular, signal, image, and multi-modal datasets. Privacy-preserving approaches such as differential privacy and adversarial training significantly reduced re-identification risks while maintaining data fidelity. However, challenges persist in preserving temporal correlations, reducing biases, and aligning with regulatory frameworks, particularly for longitudinal and high-dimensional data.
Conclusion:
Synthetic data generation holds significant potential for privacy-preserving data sharing in healthcare. Ongoing research is required to develop advanced algorithms and evaluation frameworks, ensuring synthetic data’s quality and privacy. Collaboration between technologists and policymakers is essential to create comprehensive guidelines, fostering secure and effective data sharing in healthcare.}

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the reliability of the Enhanced Paper Grip Test (EPGT) for assessing foot strength in volleyball and soccer players.
Design
A cross-sectional observational study with repeated measurements.
Setting
Field-based study.
Participants
A convenience sample of 28 athletes (13 volleyball players and 15 soccer players) participated in the study.
Main outcome measures
The main outcome measures were the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for intra-visit and inter-visit reliability, typical error, and coefficient of variation for the force (N) recorded in EPGT test.
Results
The EPGT demonstrated good to excellent relative reliability (ICC values ranged from 0.93 to 0.97) and acceptable absolute reliability (typical error = 5–8 % of the mean). Significant inter-limb asymmetries were observed in both volleyball (16.0 ± 10.2%) and soccer players (15.3 ± 9.8%).
Conclusions
The EPGT is a reliable tool for assessing foot strength in volleyball and soccer players. Further research is required to explore the applicability of EPGT in different athletic and clinical contexts, and its potential role in athletic performance and injury prevention.}

Taking inspiration from the biological template, we propose a design of flexible capacitive pressure sensors with various microstructural dielectric middle layers, fabricated using a casting-based approach. This is the first confirmed use of microstructural polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel in dielectric layers and the first example of casting in the fabrication of capacitive sensors. Notably, on account of its flexibility, the sensor also addresses the problem of microstructure fracture and misalignment during sensor bending. These sensors can achieve a maximum sensitivity of 1.34 kPa−1 (under 10 kPa) with a fast response time (50 ms), good cyclic stability (> 1000 cycles), and a wide pressure sensing range (0 ∼ 290 kPa). When attached to a cup or balloon, this study reveals that these sensors can detect the weight and rigidity of the objects, demonstrating their potential in human-machine interaction, as well as in wearable applications.}

abstract = {Background
Pediatric forms of multiple sclerosis are more active than those in adults. Yet, the effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches is not well studied in this population. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of the early use of high efficacy therapies (HETs) with the effectiveness of moderate efficacy therapies (METs) in children with MS.
Methods
This observational study included patients diagnosed with pediatric MS, at 4 hospital centers in France, during a 10-year period. METs included: interferon β-1a, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide; HETs included: fingolimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a new relapse, the secondary endpoint was EDSS worsening.
Results
Sixty-four patients were included in the analysis (80% women; mean age 15.5 years, 81% treated with MET) with a median follow-up of 22.5 months. At baseline, 52 patients were on MET (interferon β-1a, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide) and 12 patients were on HET (natalizumab, ocrelizumab). The cumulative probability of being relapse-free at 6.5 years was 23.3% on MET, vs 90.9% on HET (p = 0.013). The cumulative probability of no EDSS worsening did not differ between the 2 groups.
Conclusion
Patients starting with METs had much higher clinical disease activity than those starting early with HETs. Rapid initiation of more aggressive treatment may allow better disease control; however, the data on EDSS worsening are not conclusive.}

abstract = {Background
Many patients with unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) access health care in emergency departments (EDs). Scalable supports, such as SMS text messaging interventions, are acceptable and feasible to enhance care delivery for many health issues, including substance use. Further, SMS text messaging interventions have been shown to improve patient outcomes related to alcohol consumption (eg, reduced consumption compared to no intervention, basic health information, or drink tracking), but they are rarely offered in clinical settings.
Objective
This paper describes a mixed methods study using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework. The goal of this study was to use a stakeholder-engaged mixed methods design to assess barriers and facilitators to the implementation of SMS text messaging interventions for UAU in EDs with a focus on the recipient’s characteristics, the innovation’s degree of fit within the existing practice, and the unique nature of the inner and outer context.
Methods
This study was conducted in a large health system in the northeastern United States. We examined electronic health record data on alcohol screening in 17 EDs; surveyed 26 ED physician chairpersons on implementation feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness; and interviewed 18 ED staff and 21 patients to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation. Interviews were analyzed according to the i-PARIHS framework to assess recipient characteristics, innovation degree of fit, and inner and outer context.
Results
Electronic health record data revealed high variability in alcohol screening completion (mean 73%, range 35%‐93%), indicating potential issues in identifying patients eligible to offer the intervention. The 26 ED chair surveys revealed a relatively high level of implementation confidence (mean 4, SD 0.81), acceptability (mean 4, SD 0.71), and appropriateness (mean 3.75, SD 0.69) regarding the UAU SMS text messaging intervention; feasibility (mean 3.5, SD 0.55) had the lowest mean, indicating concerns about integrating the text intervention in the busy ED workflow. Staff were concerned about staff buy-in and adding additional discussion points to already overwhelmed patients during their ED visit but saw the need for additional low-threshold services for UAU. Patients were interested in the intervention to address drinking and health-related goals.
Conclusions
ED visits involving UAU have increased in the United States. The results of this formative study on barriers and facilitators to the implementation of UAU SMS text messaging interventions in EDs indicate both promise and caution. In general, we found that staff viewed offering such interventions as appropriate and acceptable; however, there were concerns with feasibility (eg, low alcohol risk screening rates). Patients also generally viewed the SMS text messaging intervention positively, with limited drawbacks (eg, slight concerns about having time to read messages). The results provide information that can be used to develop implementation strategies that can be tested in future studies.

abstract = {The performance of a spiral-wound reverse osmosis (RO) membrane system, operating in a cyclic mode of normal feed flow (NFF)-feed flow reversal (FFR), was evaluated for desalting feed water of high gypsum mineral scaling potential. The membrane system, with six membrane elements in series, was operated without antiscalant dosing at the condition of gypsum supersaturation at the membrane surface of the tail RO element. Automated NFF/FFR switching was triggered by an optical membrane monitoring system (MMS) installed at the last membrane element. This element alternated from being the tail to lead element at NFF and FFR modes, respectively. Multicycle NFF/FFR operation demonstrated partial cycle-to-cycle restoration of the permeate flux. However, progressive flux decline was noticeable with increased NFF/FFR cycles. Complete restoration of element productivity (in terms of permeate flux) was attained via permeate flushing (at the early membrane scaling stage) owing to gypsum scale dissolution. The study results suggest that NFF/FFR RO operation under conditions of high mineral scaling potential can be effectively combined with periodic permeate flushing. However, establishing the long-term approach feasibility will require a strategy for optimizing the frequency of NFF/FFR switching and permeate flushing in relation to the feed water quality and desalting operating conditions.}

abstract = {Generalized Image Extrapolation is an image generation sub-task and a challenging ill-posed problem. This task intends to predict unknown regions based on the center area. Unfortunately, existing methods encounter the triple dilemma: (1) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based methods can precisely extract local details but underperform in capturing global semantic information due to inductive bias, resulting in a lack of consistency in the image structure and layout. (2) Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods, although superior to global information extraction, are not sufficiently fine-grained in detail and texture generation, and (3) ViT-based approaches rely on the self-attention mechanism, which leads to a tremendous computational burden in processing images and makes model training inefficient. We propose a novel model named Mamba-GIE, designed to effectively balance information of different granularities and address the unresolved challenges in GIE tasks. At the macro level, Mamba-GIE adopts a U-shaped encoder–decoder architecture, with its core basic block being the improved Hybrid State Space Models (Hybrid-SSMs). Specifically, within the basic blocks, the input feature map is processed via two parallel branches: (1) Extracting global information via the Mamba branch and (2) Handling local details using the CNNs branch. At the micro level, we introduce the dual-level adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve adaptive feature fusion in intra- and inter-Hybrid-SSMs blocks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing GIE methods in most evaluation metrics and image generation quality. Comprehensive ablation studies and resource consumption assessments further reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of Mamba-GIE. Code: https://github.com/zrymsm/Mamba-GIE.}

Accurately estimating the number of these pests is crucial for ensuring the safety of grain storage and enabling effective management. However, most existing methods are limited to a single visual modality and rely heavily on manual annotations, making it difficult to achieve accurate counting in dense scenes. To explore the potential of multi-modal information in stored-grain pest analysis, this study introduces a multi-modal learning paradigm into this domain and proposes a multi-modal network for stored-grain pest counting. Our approach firstly leverages task-specific prompts and a modified image encoder to enhance counting performance. Then, a mean-interval counting strategy is applied to retain the discreteness of the counting values. Finally, a novel Location- Aware Cross-Entropy (LACE) loss function to achieve more accurate pest density estimation. We evaluate our experiments based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Experimental results on our various pests dataset demonstrate that our method achieves the optimal performance, with the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 1.88 and 3.34, respectively. Compared with the state of the art counting methods, these two values are reduced by 1.12 and 1.23 points, respectively.}

abstract = {Introduction
Reducing time between stroke onset and hospital intervention is crucial for positive outcomes in stroke patients. While EMS utilization decreases time to intervention, many US regions are not within timely proximity to an advanced-care-capable stroke center (ASC), defined as a comprehensive or thrombectomy-capable center. This study aims to utilize geographic methodology to identify regions in Wisconsin with both high stroke mortality and low physical accessibility to certified stroke centers (SCs), particularly ASCs.
Methods
Geocoded mortality records for stroke death between 2015 and 2020 were accessed from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Indirectly age-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated continuously across Wisconsin using adaptive spatial filtering and mortality records at the census block group level; the surface was then averaged by census tract for tract level SMRs. Addresses for SC locations within Wisconsin and bordering states were collected, and drive times from Wisconsin census tract centroids to the nearest SC subtypes were estimated. Drive times and mortality ratios were evaluated at the tract level alongside Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. Spatial error regression modeling was used to determine RUCA classifications with the highest stroke risk independent of accessibility to stroke centers.
Results
Approximately 50%, 68%, and 78% of Wisconsin residents resided within 30, 45, and 60 minutes of an ASC, respectively. Median drive time from census tract centroids to the nearest ASC were highest for rural tracts (M=90 minutes, IQR=68-115) compared to small-town (M=82 minutes, IQR=49-113), micropolitan (M=53 minutes, IQR=43-77), and metropolitan tracts (M=19 minutes, IQR=11-35; p<0.001). Clusters of high stroke SMRs were found in urban centers as well as rural areas irrespective of county declinations. Spatial regression modeling suggested small-town census tracts had the highest SMR irrespective of physical accessibility to care and spatial correlation. In small-town census tracts >45 minutes from the nearest ASC, the median stroke SMR was 1.12 (IQR=0.94-1.40) with 226,000 residents and 150 stroke deaths per year.
Conclusion
Small-town areas are associated with both long drive distance to ASC locations and high stroke mortality. Geographical analyses reveal apparent stroke care deserts and may inform strategic allocation of emergency medicine resources and coverage.}

abstract = {Social media is used to promote the HPV vaccine through various strategies, including the use of stories and narratives. Understanding the ethical concerns related to the use of social media in this capacity are important. The purpose of this study is to identify ethical concerns of using fictional stories to share information and emotions about the HPV vaccine on social media, ultimately to influence parents on their decision to vaccinate their child. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with researchers in the fields of health communication, cancer prevention, social media, and public health ethics from October to December 2021. Respondents were presented with a fictional story that consisted of seven connected vignettes about the HPV vaccine. For each vignette, respondents were asked to rate the potential benefits and risk, as well as the potential for ethical concerns of using the fictional narrative style to share information about the HPV vaccine. Descriptive statistics summarized responses, and qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results: On average, respondents (n = 41) perceived more benefits than risks when it comes to 1) using social media for health education generally and 2) using a story with connected vignettes for vaccine communication. The vignettes prioritizing vaccine hesitancy, positive emotion, and health equity were seen as having the most potential benefit, while the vignettes highlighting vaccine confidence and skepticism were seen as having the most potential risk. Overall, respondents felt there were several ethical concerns of note – persuasion was the most common (15 % of respondents) followed by deception (9 %) and manipulation (8 %). Qualitative data highlighted the importance of transparency and trust to avoid ethical violations and negative outcomes. Conclusions: Ethical concerns exist when using fictional stories to share health information on social media, particularly as new online technologies make it harder to tell fact from fiction. Practical and actionable recommendations for researchers must be developed, defining a range of ethical responsibilities.}
