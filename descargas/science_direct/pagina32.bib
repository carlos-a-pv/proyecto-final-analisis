abstract = {Developing a well-predictive machine learning model that also offers improved interpretability is a key challenge to widen the application of artificial intelligence in various application domains. In this work, we present a Data Information integrated Neural Network (DINN) algorithm that incorporates the correlation information present in the dataset for the model development. The predictive performance of DINN is also compared with a standard artificial neural network (ANN) model. The DINN algorithm is applied on two case studies of energy systems namely energy efficiency cooling (ENC) & energy efficiency heating (ENH) of the buildings, and power generation from a 365 MW capacity industrial gas turbine. For ENC, DINN presents lower mean RMSE for testing datasets (RMSE_test = 1.23 %) in comparison with the ANN model (RMSE_test = 1.41 %). Similarly, DINN models have presented better predictive performance to model the output variables of the two case studies. The input perturbation analysis following the Gaussian distribution for noise generation reveals the order of significance of the variables, as made by DINN, can be better explained by the domain knowledge of the power generation operation of the gas turbine. This research work demonstrates the potential advantage to integrate the information present in the data for the well-predictive model development complemented with improved interpretation performance thereby opening avenues for industry-wide inclusion and other potential applications of machine learning.}

Knowledge on prevalence and association of human papillomavirus (HPV) in third trimester placentae and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited. We investigated the prevalence of placental HPV at delivery, explored urine HPV characteristics associated with placental HPV and whether placental HPV increased the risk adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Methods
Pregnant women were enrolled in the Scandinavian PreventADALL mother-child cohort study at midgestation. Human papillomavirus genotyping was performed on placental biopsies collected at delivery (n = 587) and first-void urine at midgestation and delivery (n = 556). Maternal characteristics were collected by questionnaires at gestational week 18 and 34. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were registered from chart data including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus and newborns small for gestational age. Uni- and multivariable regression models were used to investigate associations.
Results
Placental HPV was detected in 18/587 (3 %). Twenty-eight genotypes were identified among the 214/556 (38 %) with midgestational urine HPV. Seventeen of the 18 women with placental HPV were midgestational HPV positive with 89 % genotype concordance. Midgestational high-risk-(HR)-HPV and high viral loads of Any- or HR-HPV were associated with placental HPV. Persisting HPV infection from midgestation to delivery was not associated with placental HPV. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were seen in 2/556 (0.4 %) of women with placental HPV.
Discussion
In this general cohort of pregnant women, the prevalence of placental HPV was 3 %, and midgestational urinary HPV 38 %. High HPV viral load increased the risk for placental HPV infections. We observed no increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with placental HPV.}

This progress has created a growing demand for accurate quality assessment metrics to evaluate the perceptual quality of T2V-generated videos and optimize video generation models. However, assessing the quality of text-to-video outputs remain challenging due to the presence of highly complex distortions, such as unnatural actions and phenomena that defy human cognition. To address these challenges, we constructed T2VEval-Bench, a multi-dimensional benchmark dataset for text-to-video quality evaluation, which contains 148 textual prompts and 1,783 videos generated by 13 T2V models. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we scored each video on four dimensions in the subjective experiment, which are overall impression, text–video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Based on T2VEval-Bench, we developed T2VEval, a multi-branch fusion scheme for T2V quality evaluation. T2VEval assesses videos across three branches: text–video consistency, realness, and technical quality. Using an attention-based fusion module, T2VEval effectively integrates features from each branch and predicts scores with the aid of a large language model. Additionally, we implemented a divide-and-conquer training strategy, enabling each branch to learn targeted knowledge while maintaining synergy with the others. Experimental results demonstrate that T2VEval achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.}

Findings
Results reveal a positive association between BDA technology and information capabilities with both BDA talent capabilities and firm performance. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that BDA talent capabilities mediate the relationship between BDA dynamic capabilities and firm performance, while top management attitude acts as a moderator, enhancing the relationship between BDA talent capabilities and firm performance.
Originality/value
There is a scarcity of research that has examined the relationship of BDA capabilities, top management attitude and firm performance. This study attempts to examine their interrelationships. First, it enhances the extant literature by elucidating the mediating role of BDA talent capabilities in the relationship between BDA technology and information capabilities and firm performance. Second, the study introduces a novel dimension by incorporating top management attitude as a moderator variable. This augmentation adds layers of complexity to comprehending BDA implementation dynamics, emphasizing leadership’s role in fostering an enabling environment for effective utilization of BDA capabilities.}

abstract = {Background
The world has witnessed increased adoption of large language models (LLMs) in the last year. Although the products developed using LLMs have the potential to solve accessibility and efficiency problems in health care, there is a lack of available guidelines for developing LLMs for health care, especially for medical education.
Objective
The aim of this study was to identify and prioritize the enablers for developing successful LLMs for medical education. We further evaluated the relationships among these identified enablers.
Methods
A narrative review of the extant literature was first performed to identify the key enablers for LLM development. We additionally gathered the opinions of LLM users to determine the relative importance of these enablers using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which is a multicriteria decision-making method. Further, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) was used to analyze the perspectives of product developers and ascertain the relationships and hierarchy among these enablers. Finally, the cross-impact matrix-based multiplication applied to a classification (MICMAC) approach was used to determine the relative driving and dependence powers of these enablers. A nonprobabilistic purposive sampling approach was used for recruitment of focus groups.
Results
The AHP demonstrated that the most important enabler for LLMs was credibility, with a priority weight of 0.37, followed by accountability (0.27642) and fairness (0.10572). In contrast, usability, with a priority weight of 0.04, showed negligible importance. The results of TISM concurred with the findings of the AHP. The only striking difference between expert perspectives and user preference evaluation was that the product developers indicated that cost has the least importance as a potential enabler. The MICMAC analysis suggested that cost has a strong influence on other enablers. The inputs of the focus group were found to be reliable, with a consistency ratio less than 0.1 (0.084).
Conclusions
This study is the first to identify, prioritize, and analyze the relationships of enablers of effective LLMs for medical education. Based on the results of this study, we developed a comprehendible prescriptive framework, named CUC-FATE (Cost, Usability, Credibility, Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Explainability), for evaluating the enablers of LLMs in medical education. The study findings are useful for health care professionals, health technology experts, medical technology regulators, and policy makers.}

abstract = {Background
Feixin decoction (FXD) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine prescription for treating chronic pulmonary heart disease and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH), However, the pharmacological mechanism of FXD in preventing HPH remains unclear.
Purpose
This study aimed to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effect of FXD on HPH and confirm the association between HPH, gut microbiota, and FXD.
Methods
Multiple in vivo animal models were used, including HPH rat models, microbiota depletion models, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) models. The HPH phenotype was evaluated through: right heart catheterization for hemodynamic parameters, doppler echocardiography for cardiac function assessment, hematoxylin-eosin staining for histopathological examination, and immunofluorescence labeling for specific protein expression analysis. Concurrently, transmission electron microscopy was utilized to observe the ultrastructure of the intestinal barrier, combined with immunofluorescence to examine the distribution characteristics of tight junction proteins. To elucidate the mechanism by which HPH ameliorates gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated metabolites, the study integrated 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiota composition analysis, dual-platform untargeted metabolomics for differential metabolite screening, and targeted metabolomics for quantitative validation.
Results
FXD exhibited significant therapeutic effects in HPH rats, ameliorating pulmonary vascular remodeling, attenuating right ventricular hypertrophy, reducing systemic inflammation, and restoring intestinal barrier function. Additionally, FXD partially restored intestinal ecological balance by enriching beneficial species (Lactobacillus and Lactobacillus johnsonii) while reducing pathogenic genera (Escherichia-Shigella and Helicobacter rodentium). Concurrently, FXD treatment induced favorable metabolic alterations, characterized by elevated levels of beneficial metabolites including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), along with reduced concentrations of pro-inflammatory 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Gut microbiota depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) studies established that FXD's therapeutic effects on HPH are mediated through gut microbiota modulation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that this protection likely involves inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. In vitro studies further corroborated these findings, showing that FXD-enriched metabolites potently suppressed abnormal proliferation, migration and apoptosis in human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs). Notably, EPA, the most significantly increased metabolite, specifically attenuates hypoxia-induced HPASMCs proliferation by interfering with the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling axis.
Conclusions
Our study confirms that FXD alleviates HPH by regulating gut microbiota and its associated metabolites and validates the potential of FXD as a gut microbiota modulator and an HPH treatment, thereby providing a new therapeutic strategy to improve treatment efficacy.}

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as promising agents due to their glucose-lowering, weight-reducing, and cardiorenal protective effects. Accumulating evidence supports their efficacy in improving glycemic control, reducing body weight, and potentially enhancing graft and patient survival across diverse transplant populations. Notably, GLP-1RAs exhibit a favorable safety profile, with minimal risk of drug interactions or rejection. Early data also suggest immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory benefits. Moreover, newer dual and triple incretin agonists offer enhanced metabolic efficacy, potentially extending these benefits further. While long-term outcomes remain under investigation, GLP-1RAs represent a compelling therapeutic option that may reshape metabolic management paradigms in both pre- and post-transplant care.}

abstract = {With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, there is a growing demand for sophisticated and powerful chips. The adoption of these processors, along with increased power and bandwidth, highlights the necessity for efficient thermal management solutions. In this context, advanced two-phase thermal management systems have emerged as promising solutions. This study introduces a novel direct-to-chip evaporative cooling (DCEC) device that uses hollow micropillars integrated with a liquid delivery system to enable microscale evaporation of water and dielectric coolants in a fully actively pumped system. The device can operate in different evaporative regimes, characterized by a concave meniscus inside the micropillar’s hole or a droplet confined at the inner or outer edge of the micropillar, depending on the heating power, thermophysical properties of the coolant, and operating pressure. To characterize the heat transfer performance of the DCEC, we conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis, varying different operating and design parameters for water, R-1336mzz(Z), and Opteon™ 2P50. Our numerical results demonstrate device-level heat fluxes of 575 W/cm2, 413 W/cm2, and 365 W/cm2 for water, R-1336mzz(Z), and Opteon™ 2P50, respectively. The corresponding heat transfer coefficients are 2.88 × 105 W/m2 K, 2.07 × 105 W/m2 K, and 1.83 × 105 W/m2 K for water, R-1336mzz(Z), and Opteon™ 2P50, respectively. We also examine the performance of the device across various operating regimes. The results show that the device achieves 1.33× and 3.1× greater heat flux when a droplet is suspended at the outer edge of the hollow micropillar, compared to the stages with a concave or convex meniscus inside the micropillar’s hole. We here conduct a detailed pressure analysis to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of the device and determine the required inlet pressure for different coolants, operating regimes, and heat loads. These inlet pressure conditions can be integrated into the design of a feedback loop system to mitigate system failures caused by flooding or dryout.}

Results indicated that greater brain reserve at age 56 was associated with better concurrent executive function (r=.10, p=.040) and less decline in executive function over 12 years (r=.34, p=.001). These associations were not moderated by cognitive reserve or APOE genotype. Twin analysis suggested associations with executive function slopes were driven by genetic influences.

A promising future direction is the use of generative AI to create customized e-commerce product descriptions for personalized, multivariant user interfaces. To validate this approach, a framework and metrics are proposed to assess the impact of segment-specific information on generated text. This led to the positioning of AI-generated content within a multivariant user interface architecture and the adaptation of a cosine similarity measure to evaluate text differentiation. The findings confirmed that the specific characteristics of e-commerce customer clusters enable generative AI to produce significantly distinct product descriptions.

The imperfect preservation of ancient manuscripts has led to different types of degradation over time, such as page yellowing, staining, and ink bleeding, seriously affecting the results of document image binarization. This work proposes an effective three-stage network method to image enhancement and binarization of degraded documents using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, in Stage-1, we first split the input images into multiple patches, and then split these patches into four single-channel patch images (gray, red, green, and blue). Then, three single-channel patch images (red, green, and blue) are processed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with normalization. In Stage-2, we use four independent generators to separately train GAN models based on the four channels on the processed patch images to extract color foreground information. Finally, in Stage-3, we train two independent GAN models on the outputs of Stage-2 and the resized original input images (512 × 512) as the local and global predictions to obtain the final outputs. The experimental results show that the Avg-Score metrics of the proposed method are 77.64, 77.95, 79.05, 76.38, 75.34, and 77.00 on the (H)-DIBCO 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 datasets, which are at the state-of-the-art level.

These queries necessitate considerable human resources while also requiring high levels of accuracy, subjectivity, and consistency, all of which critically influence operational efficiency. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes an industrial retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) using domain-specific knowledge, thereby improving the precision of question answering. A comprehensive industrial knowledge base was constructed from diverse sources, including journal articles, theses, books, and patents. A Text classification model based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs) was trained to accurately classify incoming queries. Furthermore, the general text embedding–dense passage retrieval (GTE–DPR) model was employed to perform word embedding and vector similarity retrieval, facilitating the alignment of query vectors with relevant entries in the knowledge base to obtain initial responses. These initial results were subsequently refined by LLMs to produce accurate final answers. Experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, when applied to ChatGLM2-6B, the RAG method increased the ROUGE-L score from 32.52% to 55.04% and improved accuracy from 50.52% to 73.92%. Comparable improvements were also observed with LLaMA2-7B, underscoring the RAG framework’s capability to significantly enhance the accuracy and relevance of industrial question-answering (QA) systems.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of AI, Users’ acceptance of intelligent recommendation technology on news platforms directly affects the effectiveness and sustainability of using intelligent recommendation AI news. This study investigates user acceptance of AI-driven news recommendation platforms by applying the Artificial Intelligent Device Use Acceptance (AIDUA) model. Through a survey of 1,100 users, we examine how six AI-specific factors—social influence, perceived novelty, intelligence, accuracy, transparency, and fairness—shape performance expectancy and effort expectancy, ultimately influencing acceptance decisions. Results reveal that all six factors positively impact performance expectancy, while social influence, accuracy, transparency, and fairness reduce effort expectancy. Notably, perceived accuracy (β = 0.200) exerts the strongest effect, underscoring content quality as a critical driver of trust. Emotion mediates between cognitive evaluations and behavioral outcomes, with positive emotions enhancing acceptance and negative emotions amplifying resistance. The study advances theoretical understanding by extending the AIDUA model to AI journalism, highlighting the dual-path role of cognitive and affective evaluations.}

However, the level of specificity of this literature is low. Advancing current insights, we examined how three concrete examples of active (i.e., generate/disseminate terrorist propaganda; interact with co-ideologues) and two examples of passive (i.e., learn about terrorist ideologies/actors; learn tactical information) internet use are related to distinct distal and proximal dynamics of radicalisation. Additionally, we assessed associations between the different types of internet use and the likelihood of having planned/committed a terrorist attack. We analysed a unique dataset based on closed-source risk assessment reports of individuals convicted of terrorism(-related) offences in England and Wales (N = 377). Results of this secondary data analysis pointed to three internet use repertoires: (1) learning about tactical information and terrorist ideologies/actors; (2) only learning about terrorist ideologies/actors; (3) active internet use and learning about terrorist ideologies/actors. Learning about tactical information and terrorist ideologies/actors was (compared to the other two repertoires) associated with a higher likelihood of having planned/committed an act of terrorism. Additionally, levels of capability were higher if individuals learnt both tactical and ideological information online compared to using the internet actively and browsing content about terrorist ideologies/actors. Individuals characterised by either internet use repertoire did, however, not vary significantly regarding their levels of engagement with extremist ideas and actors and the degree to which they had developed an extremist mindset. The results can inform terrorist/violent extremist risk assessment.}

Peptide vaccines engineered with the protective epitopes of FMDV have provided a safer alternative for disease prevention than the traditional inactivated vaccines.

Here, we showed that recombinant T4 phages displaying the B-cell epitope of the FMDV VP1 protein (VP1130–158), without additional adjuvants, induced similar levels of antigen-specific IgG1 but higher levels of IgG2a compared to the peptide vaccine. Incorporation of a CD4+ T cell epitope, either 3A21–35 of FMDV 3A protein or P2830–844 of tetanus toxoid, further enhanced the immunogenicity of VP1-T4 phage nanoparticles. Interestingly, the extrinsic adjuvant cannot enhance the immunogenicity of the nanoparticles, indicating the intrinsic adjuvant activities of T4 phage. Furthermore, the recombinant T4 phage can be produced on a large scale within a short period of time at a relatively low-cost using Escherichia coli, heralding its potential in the development of a safe and effective FMDV vaccine.}

For this purpose, we employed 4 groups of rats, 2 male and 2 female groups, chronically treated with saline or nicotine 3 mg/kg i.p. for 30 days, spanning from postnatal day 30 to postnatal day 60. Utilizing quantitative analyses and T-pattern detection and analysis, our findings revealed a complex and multifaceted behavioral reorganization in adolescent rats subjected to chronic nicotine administration.

Forty-five adapted tactics are introduced to aid users in defining information needs, refining queries, and evaluating ChatGPT's responses for relevance, utility, and reliability. Using the Efficient Search Tactic Identification (ESTI) method and constant comparison analysis, these tactics were mapped into a stratified model with seven categories. The framework provides a structured approach for users to leverage conversational agents more effectively, promoting critical thinking and iterative learning.

However, two-phase heat transfer in microchannels is adversely affected by flow boiling instabilities. The present work explores a passive vapor venting technique featuring a superhydrophobic stainless steel mesh screen and a fluidic dampener to suppress flow boiling instabilities in microchannels. Experimental investigations have been made to study the flow and heat transfer characteristics in conventional microchannels, i.e., non-venting (NV) and microchannels with passive vapor venting (VV) configuration. Microchannels have been fabricated on a copper block, chosen for its high thermal conductivity, and enclosed within a Teflon housing to enhance thermal insulation. A superhydrophobic coating of Cytonix Fluropel is applied on the stainless steel mesh to make it superhydrophobic. Flow boiling experiments have been performed using deionized water, with mass fluxes ranging from 255-535 kg/m2s and heat fluxes from 10 to 220 W/cm2. An early evacuation of large vapor slugs in the VV configuration eliminates the vapor clogging and backflow, thus promoting frequent rewetting of the hotspots in the microchannels. The high amplitude and low frequency flow fluctuations in NV configurations are converted into low amplitude and high frequency fluctuations in the VV configuration. The temperature and pressure fluctuations are drastically reduced in the VV configuration, resulting in a 95 % higher heat transfer coefficient (HTC) than in the NV configuration. It also produces a 47 % reduction in pressure drop compared to the NV configuration.}

Mechanism tests show that public data platform openness plays a role in corporate employment through the production scale expansion effect, the business scope expansion effect, and the digital asset investment effect. In addition, examining the two dimensions of data quality and platform construction quality, we find that the quality of public data openness has a significant effect on corporate employment.

Research project evaluation upon completion is one of the important tasks for research management in government funding agencies and research institutions. Due to the increased number of funded projects, it is hard to find qualified reviewers in the same research disciplines. This paper proposes a machine learning and large language model integrated approach to provide decision support for research project evaluation. Machine learning algorithms are proposed to compute the weights of key performance indicators (KPIs) and scores of KPIs based on the evaluation results of completed projects, large language models are used to summarize research contributions or findings on project reports. Then domain experts are invited to consolidate the weights and scores for the KPIs and assess the novelty and impact of research contribution or findings. Experiments have been conducted in practical settings and the results have shown that the proposed method can greatly improve research management efficiency and provide more consistent evaluation results on funded research projects.}

abstract = {Both increased plant density and wide seedling strip planting (WSP) can improve wheat grain yield. However, whether and how greater gains in grain yield can be achieved by combining WSP with an increased plant density is unclear. In this study, two winter wheat cultivars were subjected to three plant densities (lower, normal, and higher) and two planting patterns (conventional planting [CP] and WSP). The effects of plant density, planting pattern, and their combination on the solar radiation interception and conversion, biomass accumulation, harvest index, and grain yield were investigated. In response to an increase in plant density from lower to higher and a shift from CP to WSP and their combination, grain yield increased by 15.43 %, 10.85 % and 27.62 % for cultivar Taimai198, and by 13.13 %, 8.31 % and 22.41 % for Shannong30, respectively. The larger increases in grain yield were mainly ascribed to enhanced dry matter production, in particular after anthesis with no variation or a slight decline in the harvest index. The higher plant density was the dominant driver of the enhanced radiation interception, whereas WSP was mainly responsible for ameliorating the reduction in radiation use efficiency (RUE) caused by the higher plant density. The combined effects of these two management practices in increasing grain yield were much greater than the independent effects of a shift from CP to WSP or an increase in plant density. Optimizing the planting method may thus be a promising option for further improving grain yield of a densely planted wheat population by increasing the RUE.}

A rarely discussed phenomenon, though gaining importance considering the increasing number of real-life use cases, is using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. By manipulating visualizations, artificial intelligence (AI) allows politicians to eliminate or minimize the deficits of their performance and highlight or create features perceived as attractive by the audience. Such manipulations pose a significant epistemic problem, and can severely distort perception of real politicians and their characteristics. These disruptions might correspond to the classic “Ship of Theseus” paradox that addresses the problem of changing identity. The aim of this study is to analyze how this philosophical conundrum could be used for crafting better transparency obligations (disclaimers) for using deep fakes for political advertising purposes. The aim of such disclaimers is to sensitize and protect public opinion against manipulation. However, at the moment the basic labels concentrate on technological dimension of manipulation, overlooking cognitive consequences for human audiences. This paper proposes extensive disclaimers to strengthen their informative and sensitizing potential.}

The analysis revealed that the potential distribution area of Asian elephants spans 530,418 km2 (10.59% of the study area), with significant potential distribution areas observed in Indonesia (136,890 km2) and Malaysia (119,497 km2). Vegetation type emerged as the dominant environmental factor influencing model outcomes, encompassing aspects such as broadleaved evergreen tree coverage, broadleaved deciduous closed tree coverage and EVI. The potential distribution area of Asian elephants overlaps with regions inhabited by 55.25 million people, with 6.07 million people residing in highly suitable habitats. India and Malaysia have high potential for human-elephant conflict (HEC) due to the high number of people living in potential and highly suitable habitats for elephants. Bangladesh and Nepal, on the other hand, have fewer people living in these habitats suitable for elephants, but they face relatively high human population density in these areas.}

abstract = {The objectivity of a vortex identification method, which is critical in capturing vortices in rotating machineries, requires that the visualized vortical structures are independent of the movement of the observer. However, the common methodology to objectivize an Eulerian vortex identification method with relative/net vorticity or relative/net velocity gradient suffers from the issues of requirement to select a spatial volume to do vorticity average and inconsistency with the non-objective counterpart in an inertial reference frame. In this regard, a new objective Liutex vector method to visualize vortices is developed in the current study, which is based on the observed intermittency of Liutex represented vortices in turbulence. The intermittency indicates that a large volume fraction of the considered domain is void of Liutex, and the rotating motion of the observer is very likely to decrease this volume fraction. Therefore, an optimization procedure is proposed to approximate the rotating angular velocity of the observer by maximizing the zero Liutex volume percentage. With the known angular velocity to offset the rotational effects of the observer’s reference frame, objective version of Eulerian vortex identification methods can be introduced. As an example, the new objective Liutex method has been applied to turbulent channel flow at Reτ=180 in arbitrarily rotating coordinate systems, and the results show that the new method is both objective, i.e. independent of observer’s motion including translation and rotation and consistent with the original Liutex method in an inertial reference frame.}

Tryptophan metabolism is involved in esophageal carcinogenesis. However, its genetic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic variants that encode tryptophan metabolism on susceptibility to esophageal cancer (EC) and elucidate the mechanisms underlying genetic variation in EC progression.
Methods
Age- and sex-matched cohorts of 167 patients with EC and 236 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The concentrations of tryptophan and its metabolites were determined by self-assembled high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. High-throughput sequencing techniques were utilized to detect candidate coding genetic variants, and dominant genetic models were used to elucidate the genotypic associations.
Results
Tryptophan metabolism was significantly imbalanced in patients with EC, with elevated indolepropionic acid (IPA) levels reducing the risk of EC susceptibility. ACSM2B rs73530508 (A > G) mutation was associated with higher IPA levels in vivo (P = 0.0004, false discovery rate [FDR] = 0.0092) and significantly reduced the risk of EC susceptibility (odds ratio [OR]: 0.576, Padj = 0.0161). Mediation effect analysis indicated that single-nucleotide polymorphism may inhibit carcinogenesis by reducing IPA metabolism and excretion with a mediation effect of 45.54%.
Conclusions
This study identifies the potential mechanism of ACSM2B rs73530508 (A > G) in esophageal carcinogenesis and its role in driving increased IPA levels, thereby suppressing the risk of development.}

abstract = {With the ongoing climate warming, recurrent extreme rainfall events have become a pervasive global challenge. The integration of disaster warnings with precipitation nowcasting can effectively mitigate both human casualties and economic losses. Currently, deep learning techniques are widely employed for radar echo extrapolation as a primary approach to precipitation nowcasting. However, the lack of physical constraints often leads to blurriness in predicted images as the forecast time increases, ultimately resulting in a decline in forecast quality. In this study, we proposed an evolution network that incorporates Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to extract physical motion information and enhance the network’s ability to learn such information. The results demonstrated that employing convolutional KANs (ConvKANs) as the fundamental module significantly reduced the number of model parameters while achieving superior performance. ConvKAN proved to be a highly effective foundational module for the evolution network, not only substantially reducing the number of model parameters and effectively improving specific meteorological metrics (CSI, POD) and the clarity metric of predicted images (Tenengrad), but also achieving the best performance in precipitation forecasting. Notably, our CUX2&evOnet (K2) model combining convolutional modules exhibited optimal performance. Compared to the CNN-based model named CUX2&evOnet(C32), it improved CSI, POD, and Tenengrad by 2.02%, 5.17%, and 2.52%, respectively, while requiring only 2.37% of its evolution network parameters. These findings confirm that deep learning models driven by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT) exhibit enhanced proficiency in precipitation nowcasting.}

Teachers’ information-based teaching ability has emerged as a pivotal factor in driving the digital transformation of education, particularly in computer science and modern pedagogical approaches. Grounded in the Quality Matters (QM) online course quality standards, this study developed a comprehensive index system for evaluating teachers’ information-based teaching competencies using advanced methods such as factor analysis, index extraction, and divergence analysis. The findings reveal that the evaluation ability of information-based teaching has a positive impact on the design ability of information-based teaching objectives, the provision ability of information-based teaching resources, the organization ability of information-based teaching activities, and the guidance ability of information-based teaching, and the path coefficients are 0.86, 0.60, 0.36, and 0.45, respectively. Teachers’ platform resource integration ability has a positive impact on information-based teaching evaluation ability, information-based teaching tool application ability, and information-based teaching activity organization ability, and the path coefficients are 0.45, 0.71, and 0.39, respectively; Teachers’ organization ability of information-based teaching activities has a positive impact on information-based teaching guidance ability, and the path coefficient is 0.39. The ability of teachers to use information-based teaching tools has a positive impact on the organization ability of information-based teaching activities, and the path coefficient is 0.25. The ability to provide information teaching resources and the ability to apply information teaching tools have a positive impact on each other, and the path coefficients are 0.43 and 0.49, respectively. These seven dimensions have constructed the model of teachers' online teaching ability, and proposed the ways to improve teachers' online teaching ability based on the current situation of teachers' online teaching ability.}

abstract = {As a highly toxic gas pollutant and also an endogenous gaseous signaling molecule existing in a variety of physiological processes, the rapid and accurate in-field detection of hydrogen sulfide is of great concern. Nevertheless, two drawbacks as for the optical probes for H2S detection, taking about a long time to reach the optical signal balance or the low selectivity, always exist. Herein, by using a highly photoluminescent and H2S-stimuli responsive silver-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs): Ag-BDC (BDC = 1, 4-benzene dicarboxylate), we demonstrated that the luminescence intensity of Ag-BDC MOFs was inversely proportional to the concentration of H2S due to the Ag–S coordination and the obstruction of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition process, and there was a quick response time of below 3.0 min. Combined with a simple customized device to separate H2S from the sample, the selectivity of the method for H2S detection could be greatly improved, and no interference would be caused even if the other sulfur-containing species coexisted. The luminescence probe presented a favorable sensitivity within a linear range of 0.1–1000 μM along with a detection limit of 23.7 nM. When employed to assay the endogenous sulfide level in the human serum and mouse brain tissue, the approach showed recoveries from 96.3% to 102% with relative standard derivation (RSD) less than 2.0%. By the integration of the responsive luminescent silver-based MOFs with a simple self-assembled headspace separation device, obviously the present strategy could be beneficial to the development and design of the in-field fast H2S measurement, possessing particular advantages in biological systems to eliminate the potential interferences.}

abstract = {Background
The rapid growth of web-based symptom checkers (SCs) is not matched by advances in quality assurance. Currently, there are no widely accepted criteria assessing SCs’ performance. Vignette studies are widely used to evaluate SCs, measuring the accuracy of outcome. Accuracy behaves as a composite metric as it is affected by a number of individual SC- and tester-dependent factors. In contrast to clinical studies, vignette studies have a small number of testers. Hence, measuring accuracy alone in vignette studies may not provide a reliable assessment of performance due to tester variability.
Objective
This study aims to investigate the impact of tester variability on the accuracy of outcome of SCs, using clinical vignettes. It further aims to investigate the feasibility of measuring isolated aspects of performance.
Methods
Healthily’s SC was assessed using 114 vignettes by 3 groups of 3 testers who processed vignettes with different instructions: free interpretation of vignettes (free testers), specified chief complaints (partially free testers), and specified chief complaints with strict instruction for answering additional symptoms (restricted testers). κ statistics were calculated to assess agreement of top outcome condition and recommended triage. Crude and adjusted accuracy was measured against a gold standard. Adjusted accuracy was calculated using only results of consultations identical to the vignette, following a review and selection process. A feasibility study for assessing symptom comprehension of SCs was performed using different variations of 51 chief complaints across 3 SCs.
Results
Intertester agreement of most likely condition and triage was, respectively, 0.49 and 0.51 for the free tester group, 0.66 and 0.66 for the partially free group, and 0.72 and 0.71 for the restricted group. For the restricted group, accuracy ranged from 43.9% to 57% for individual testers, averaging 50.6% (SD 5.35%). Adjusted accuracy was 56.1%. Assessing symptom comprehension was feasible for all 3 SCs. Comprehension scores ranged from 52.9% and 68%.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that by improving standardization of the vignette testing process, there is a significant improvement in the agreement of outcome between testers. However, significant variability remained due to uncontrollable tester-dependent factors, reflected by varying outcome accuracy. Tester-dependent factors, combined with a small number of testers, limit the reliability and generalizability of outcome accuracy when used as a composite measure in vignette studies. Measuring and reporting different aspects of SC performance in isolation provides a more reliable assessment of SC performance. We developed an adjusted accuracy measure using a review and selection process to assess data algorithm quality. In addition, we demonstrated that symptom comprehension with different input methods can be feasibly compared. Future studies reporting accuracy need to apply vignette testing standardization and isolated metrics.}

To this end, motivational writing instructional strategies were integrated into the process-genre argumentative writing instructional approach and the impacts on students' writing engagement and achievements were assessed at a university in China. Quantitative data were gathered from 142 undergraduate students employing a pretest-posttest control group design. Additionally, self-report data regarding students' writing engagement and perceptions were collected from experimental groups to examine the contribution of students' perceptions of the motivational process-genre writing instructional approach to their engagement. Moreover, focus-group data were gathered from four highly-engaged and high-achieving students to identify the factors facilitating their engagement. The results showed that the experimental groups wrote significantly better argumentative essays than did the control group, and regression analyses indicated that motivational instructional strategies contributed to students' engagement significantly. Further, the thematic analysis of focus group data suggested that the three major facilitators of students’ engagement were collaborative motivational writing learning strategies, competence-boosting experiences, and active participation in creating learning opportunities. These findings show the paramount significance of incorporating the motivational strategies into the process-genre writing instructional approach. Other pedagogical implications and recommendations for further research are also discussed.}

Specifically, we first applied the Multi-LLMs Validation method, significantly reducing the manual proofreading workload involved in structured data extraction. Furthermore, based on this approach, we successfully established the largest CPM dataset (https://gitee.com/tcmdoc/cpm) with continuous on-line updates. Afterwards, we combined the CPM dataset and the RAG architecture, along with effective integration of generative capacity from LLMs and external data retrieval; all of which contributed to the RAG-CPMF.

Digital economy purportedly offers a potential way to achieve sustainable development. However, this is still debated and a consensus is elusive. Here, we propose a novel nonlinear d curve hypothesis to describe the relationship between the digital economy and carbon emissions, whereby the digital economy can no longer contribute to carbon abatement once it is overdeveloped because of a rebound in energy consumption (i.e., the overdevelopment trap). To test this hypothesis, we used county-level panel data from China and conducted an empirical analysis with expanded STIRPAT models. Through a suite of robustness tests, we find evidence supporting our hypothesis, in that nearly 30 % of our samples (N = 1450 counties) had stepped into the overdevelopment trap, with this problem being most severe in eastern China. Altogether, we believe those countries relying heavily on thermal power—and more likely to suffer from a rebound in fossil energy consumption—should take a more cautious attitude towards implementing their digital economy and consider other ways to meet their carbon abatement goals.}

Taking a social perspective, this article examines how the design of mixed-reward LPs helps to reinforce Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) image. Results from two experiments show that mixed-reward LPs can improve a firm's CSR image as well as customer loyalty, and the importance of giving customers options. Specifically, compared to a self-benefiting reward LP, a mixed-reward LP improves CSR image, but only when customers can choose the recipient charity. Allowing customers to split their donation between multiple charities further improves CSR image through the mediating effects of LP usage (i.e., prosocial redemption) and a social benefit for the customer (i.e., warm glow). These findings suggest that LPs can be relevant drivers for doing good and offer an additional, socially-based logic to rethink their role and design.}

Based on models, nine critical SRL events were retrieved from participants‘ think-aloud protocols and analyzed through sequential clustering analysis. The results show two SRL groups indicating distinct self-regulatory sequential patterns. One group had a shorter sequence length and dominantly enacted elaboration activities (Low-SRL group), while the other had longer sequence lengths and engaged in diverse SRL activities (High-regulation group). Relating to TPACK performance indicated by the quality of lesson plans, the results reveal that the participants in the High-SRL group outperformed their counterparts in the Low-SRL group. The findings are consistent with previous evidence and provide implications for practitioners about the importance of student teachers’ self-regulation trajectories.}

Due to the limitations of unstructured or semi-structured text records, current hazardous chemical accident research heavily relies on expert evaluations, often resulting in inefficiency, lack of intelligence, and subjectivity. To overcome this limitation, we propose an accident analysis framework that combines deep learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and topic mining algorithms. First, we employ a RoBERTa-BiLSTM-Attention-CRF method based on a pre-trained model to automatically recognize and extract information from accident reports according to predefined accident entities. Second, we construct a dictionary specific to the hazardous chemicals domain and apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to analyze the causes of accidents within the “CAUSE” entity, thereby deriving the hazardous themes implied in the accidents. Finally, we validate the model on a self-constructed hazardous chemical named entity recognition incident report dataset (HCNER). The research findings indicate that the methodology proposed in this study effectively addresses the challenges associated with dispersed textual information, specialized terminology, and data formatting in the digital processing of hazardous chemical incidents. This advancement propels the development within the domain of hazardous chemical safety management and serves as a viable approach for investigating the causes of such incidents.}

The animal sector is one of the major contributors to the development and dissemination of AMR and accounts for more than 50 % of global antibiotics usage. The use of antibiotics exerts a selective pressure for resistant bacteria in the exposed microbiome, but many questions about the epidemiology of AMR in farm environments remain unanswered. This is connected to several methodological challenges and limitations, such as inconsistent sampling methods, complexity of farm environment samples and the lack of standardized protocols for sample collection, processing and bioinformatical analysis. In this project, we combined metagenomics and bioinformatics to optimise the methodology for reproducible research on the resistome in complex samples from the indoor farm environment. The work included optimizing sample collection, transportation, and storage, as well as DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, such as metagenome assembly and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) detection. Our studies suggest that the current most optimal and cost-effective pipeline for ARG search should be based on Illumina sequencing of sock sample material at high depth (at least 25 M 250 bp PE for AMR gene families and 43 M for gene variants). We present a computational analysis utilizing MEGAHIT assembly to balance the identification of bacteria carrying ARGs with the potential loss of diversity and abundance of resistance genes. Our findings indicate that searching against multiple ARG databases is essential for detecting the highest diversity of ARGs.}

This pest periodically affects hardwood trees such as trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.) across large areas, causing mortality and altering stand attributes and long-term dynamics. In this study, I quantified the responses of aspen stands to forest tent caterpillar defoliation and overstory dieback, including short-term (5 years after dieback) and long-term (20 years later) dynamics. Results indicate that affected stands fully recovered to pre-dieback density but not basal area. Defoliation caused overstory dieback that stimulated understory growth and regeneration but the hardwood regeneration (mostly aspen) did not adequately replace hardwood trees lost to defoliation, resulting in decreased hardwood composition relative to unaffected stands. The high density in affected stands suggested possible further basal area recovery as regeneration and released understory conifers grew into main canopy, following the general trends of boreal mixedwood succession. The results support earlier projections based on residual stand attributes shortly after dieback and reported boreal species growth and mortality rates that indicate forest tent caterpillar defoliation and subsequent overstory dieback would accelerate aspen stand transition to conifer dominance and delay the availability of stands for harvesting by 40–50 years as stands recover.}

Existing UDA approaches highly depend on the accessibility of source domain data, which is usually limited in practical scenarios due to privacy protection, data storage and transmission cost, and computation burden. To tackle this issue, many source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) methods have been proposed recently, which perform knowledge transfer from a pre-trained source model to the unlabeled target domain with source data inaccessible. A comprehensive review of these works on SFUDA is of great significance. In this paper, we provide a timely and systematic literature review of existing SFUDA approaches from a technical perspective. Specifically, we categorize current SFUDA studies into two groups, i.e., white-box SFUDA and black-box SFUDA, and further divide them into finer subcategories based on different learning strategies they use. We also investigate the challenges of methods in each subcategory, discuss the advantages/disadvantages of white-box and black-box SFUDA methods, conclude the commonly used benchmark datasets, and summarize the popular techniques for improved generalizability of models learned without using source data. We finally discuss several promising future directions in this field.}

abstract = {Breast cancer stands as the most frequently diagnosed life-threatening cancer among women worldwide. Understanding patients' drug experiences is essential to improving treatment strategies and outcomes. In this research, we conduct knowledge discovery on breast cancer drugs using patients' reviews. A new machine learning approach is developed by employing clustering, text mining and regression techniques. We first use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to discover the main aspects of patients' experiences from the patients' reviews on breast cancer drugs. We also use Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to segment the data based on patients' overall satisfaction. We then use the Forward Entry Regression technique to find the relationship between aspects of patients' experiences and drug's effectiveness in each segment. The textual reviews analysis on breast cancer drugs found 8 main side effects: Musculoskeletal Effects, Menopausal Effects, Dermatological Effects, Metabolic Effects, Gastrointestinal Effects, Neurological and Cognitive Effects, Respiratory Effects and Cardiovascular. The results are provided and discussed. The findings of this study are expected to offer valuable insights and practical guidance for prospective patients, aiding them in making informed decisions regarding breast cancer drug consumption.}

In a companion article (Zhao et al., 2023), the modification of pectin structure with high-pressure processing (HPP) was reported. In this study, the functionalities of the HPP-modified pectins (Hp) were evaluated and compared with commercial low methoxy (LM) and high methoxy (HM) pectins. The calcium sensitivity of Hp was comparable to that of commercial LM pectin, which was remarkably higher than the control pectin extracted from untreated peel and commercial HM pectin. Hp had a dramatically higher gelling capacity for calcium-mediated gelation than the control and commercial HM pectin. The strength and viscoelastic properties of Hp-calcium gels were comparable to that of commercial LM pectin. Meanwhile, most of the Hp also showed a comparable gelling capacity for sugar-acid-mediated gelation to that of the control and commercial HM pectin. Hp also had higher emulsifying stability than the control and commercial pectins. The increased capacity of Hp for calcium-mediated gelation was attributed to the block-wise distribution of non-esterified galacturonic acid (GalA) introduced by the HPP treatment, and the higher emulsifying stability was mainly attributed to the debranching of pectin. The study further confirmed that pectin functionalities were highly correlated with its structural properties. The data reveal the great potential of producing low-cost, high-quality pectins with increased gelling capacity and a broadened scope of applications, by adding a simple HPP pretreatment of fresh source material for pectin extraction.}

abstract = {Background
To date, no direct comparisons have been performed to compare the effectiveness of all epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.
Methods
We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing osimertinib, lazertinib, aumolertinib, befotertinib, furmonertinib, dacomitinib, afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib, and chemotherapy. Pooled estimations of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and toxicity (grade ≥ 3 adverse events) were performed within the Bayesian framework.
Results
Twenty-three trials involving 11 treatments were included. All EGFR-TKIs improved PFS relative to chemotherapy, except for icotinib (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26–1.44). All EGFR-TKIs demonstrated significant ORR benefits over chemotherapy. Osimertinib seemed to prolong PFS compared with icotinib (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.1–0.86), gefitinib (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.21–0.74), and erlotinib (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29–1.0). In addition, osimertinib showed favorable superiority in improving OS compared with chemotherapy (HR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.43–0.82), gefitinib (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.45–0.83), erlotinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48–0.89), and afatinib (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.44–0.94). Among these regimens, afatinib showed the highest ORR (cumulative probability: 96.96%). Icotinib was associated with minimal toxicity among the EGFR-TKIs, followed by furmonertinib and osimertinib. Moreover, the toxicity spectra differed among the EGFR-TKIs. Subgroup analyses of patients with two common types of EGFR mutations indicated that furmonertinib possessed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with exon 19 deletion, and lazertinib showed the greatest PFS benefit in patients with Leu858Arg mutation. We also identified differences between EGFR-TKIs in prolonging PFS in patients with brain metastasis.
Conclusions
Osimertinib is the first choice of treatment with considerable efficacy and safety for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The treatments associated with the best PFS in patients with exon 19 deletions and Leu858Arg mutations were furmonertinib and lazertinib, respectively.}

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly diffusion models, to automate the sizing of analog Integrated Circuits (ICs), given the constraints of their performance metrics. Researchers have explored various automation methods, including meta-heuristics and optimization-based approaches, to address this challenge. However, each method presents distinct drawbacks and, at times, yields inefficient results. While studies have made some attempts using ANNs, they commonly face the hurdle of the ill-posed nature of the problem exacerbated by the scarcity of databases for training the models. Therefore, this work introduces a novel approach to automate the design process by leveraging diffusion models to enhance the existing ANNs-based framework and address the limitations of previous methodologies. Specifically, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to tackle the inverse problem of the analog IC sizing. DDPMs employ a noising and denoising architecture, where they learn to reconstruct input distributions by progressively adding and removing noise. Once trained, the DDPM can generate new data from pure noise. We show that even a simple DDPM can sample sizing solutions in a small amount of time, which is an important steppingstone for future research. Experimental results indicate that our models successfully sized the two tested circuits with an average median error of around 6%, surpassing the state-of-the-art approaches whose error was over 60 to 70% higher. Moreover, by taking advantage of the generative capabilities of our models, we were able to generate points for targets within the dataset, with most of them showing an error below 3%. For the more challenging targets, we managed to find solutions with errors below 10%, while the supervised approaches struggled to achieve errors under 20%.}

This shift is poised to inject renewed dynamism into the global economy. This paper develops a theoretical framework that elucidates the relationship between AI adoption and innovation within digital enterprises, drawing upon resource-based theory (RBT) and absorptive capacity theory (ACAP). Utilizing a sample of Chinese digital enterprises listed overseas from 2000 to 2023, this study employs Python to extract keywords associated with “artificial intelligence” from corporate annual reports, thereby constructing a proxy measure for AI adoption. We empirically investigate the impact of AI adoption on innovation within digital enterprises. Our findings demonstrate that AI adoption significantly enhances innovation in digital enterprises, a result that remains robust across a series of robustness tests. Additional analysis reveals that the absorptive capacity of enterprises mediates the relationship between AI adoption and innovation, while slack resources act as a moderating factor, attenuating the link between absorptive capacity and innovation. This paper extends our understanding of the implications of AI on broader innovation entities, elucidating the mechanisms and boundary conditions of AI application in digital enterprises. It also offers insights into how enterprises can effectively integrate AI technology, strategically configure and utilize slack resources, and ultimately enhance their innovation performance.}

Ethical argumentation is a combination of facts, emotions, and values that considers the consequences of right and wrong based on the values of individuals and communities. It requires support from both critical thinking to argue clearly, use evidence, and from creative thinking to generate new standpoints and solutions. This study developed a model to analyse undergraduate students’ ethical arguments during role play and free debate (n = 199) in asynchronous online discussions in an authentic, non-scaffolded blended-learning classroom. The instructions include the rules for critical discussion to promote respect for diverse opinions and collaboration, and a model of sound argument structure and common fallacies. Theoretical models of ethical argumentation and iterative data analysis were used to identify and evaluate the argumentation structure and content across different levels of quality. The quality of the content and structural complexity varied between acceptable and unacceptable depending on the topic and students’ engagement to argue. A considerable number of low-quality unsubstantiated arguments ‘other structures’ was also observed. The argumentation was generally fair and without personal attack. The number of fallacies and weak arguments was high for the first four of the six studied topics but significantly decreased thereafter. Students considered the ethical consequences across the topics. The results have implications for integrating critical, creative, and ethical thinking into argumentation in computer-supported collaborative learning environments and citizenship education.}

The phase chemistry and microstructure are well-controlled during the sintering process. The tapes are further developed into multilayer porous/dense/porous structures to provide a fast Li+ conducting ceramic framework for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). X-ray micro computed tomography (microCT) analysis reveals a fully interconnected pore network in the outer porous layers. In addition, the multilayer structures exhibit a critical current density (CCD) of 2.5 mA cm−2 at room temperature and are stable over 200 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 in symmetric Li cells.

Additionally, open-ended responses from all 258 participants provided insights into students’ perspectives on factors affecting their reading compliance. Results indicate that academic listening ability had a large effect on lecture comprehension whereas the effect for reading compliance was small. Moreover, academic reading expectancy and value were identified as having only a small effect on pre-lecture reading compliance.

Methods
MDR-TB patients managed in the Taiwan MDR-TB consortium between July 2009–December 2019 were eligible. Treatment outcomes at 30 months were assessed. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate factors associated with treatment outcomes.
Results
109 patients with FQ-resistant MDR-TB and 218 patients with FQ-susceptible MDR-TB were included. 60 (55.1%) patients with FQ-resistant MDR-TB and 63 (28.9%) patients with FQ-susceptible MDR-TB have been treated with new or repurposed drugs (p < 0.01). Of the 218 patients with FQ-susceptible MDR-TB, 187 (85.8%) had treatment success, 30 (13.8%) died, no treatment failure, and 1 (0.5%) was loss-to-follow-up; of the 109 patients with FQ-resistant MDR-TB, 78 (71.6%) had treatment success, 21 (19.3%) died, 9 (8.3%) had treatment failure, and 1 (0.9%) was loss-to-follow-up (p < 0.01). The use of new or repurposed drugs was not associated with treatment outcomes among patients with FQ-susceptible MDR-TB. No patients with FQ-resistant MDR-TB treated with ≥2 new or repurposed drugs within 6 months of treatment initiation had treatment failure (p = 0.03). Patients with FQ-resistant MDR-TB treated with 1 new or repurposed drugs was more likely to have treatment failure as compared with patients not treated with new or repurposed drugs (adjOR 7.06, 95% CI 1.72–29.06).
Conclusions
Proper use of new or repurposed anti-TB drugs can mitigate treatment failure in FQ-resistant MDR-TB.}

ONTs, including siRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, saRNA, miRNA, aptamers, and decoys, offer promising solutions for targeting previously “undruggable” molecules, such as transcription factors, and enhancing cancer immunotherapy by overcoming tumor immune evasion. The promise of ONT application in cancer treatment is exemplified by the recent FDA approval of the first oligonucleotide-based treatment to myeloproliferative disease. At the same time, there are challenges in delivering ONTs to specific tissues, mitigating off-target effects, and improving cellular uptake and endosomal release. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ONTs in clinical trials, emerging delivery strategies, and innovative therapeutic approaches, emphasizing the role of ONTs in immunotherapy and addressing hurdles that hinder their clinical translation. By examining advances and remaining challenges, we highlight opportunities for ONTs to revolutionize oncology and enhance patient outcomes.}

This study presents a framework for complementing these assessments with kinematic measurements using 3D pose estimation. A total 809 rising and 791 lying down posture transitions were recorded over 12 cubicles by 7 synchronized cameras and processed with 3D pose estimation locating the position of the poll, withers, T13 and sacrum. First, the displacement of the keypoints was used to detect phases of the posture transitions. This detection was compared with visual observations of 200 recordings. The average mean absolute difference in detected timestamps between human and machine across all phases was 0.5 s (average σ = 0.7) and was under 0.9 s for all phases. Second, indicators were scored based on spatial use and duration, and their distribution compared to existing thresholds. We observed that 59.9 % of rising bouts and 29.1 % of lying down bouts exceeded at least one threshold. Rising delay occurred in 2.8 % of rising bouts and backwards crawling in 59.2 %. Lying down duration exceeded the threshold in 28.9 % of bouts, and rear limbs shifting duration in 8.3 %. Side lunge had a binary threshold which was not adapted to continuous sensor data. Finally, we investigated the association between indicators and found distinct dimensions for head lunge and crawling. We conclude that 3D pose is useful to score posture transition indicators, and that several indicators should be used together to capture distinct dimensions.}

Effectively utilizing multi-scale features and query information poses a challenging problem in this domain. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach called the multi-scale and attention-based self-support prototype few-shot semantic segmentation network (MASNet). First, a multi-scale feature enhancement module is designed to obtain features at different scales to enrich global context information. Then, simple and efficient channel attention is utilized to guide the query features related to the target class. Finally, the query prototype is matched with the query features using a self-supporting matching module. This strategy efficiently captures class-based features and addresses the issue of intra-class variance in few-shot segmentation. The experimental results on Pascal-5i, COCO-20i and Abdominal MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves remarkable robustness and improved accuracy performance.}

However, implementing LLM-enhanced conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) presents significant ethical, technical, and clinical challenges. In this viewpoint paper, we discuss 2 challenges that affect the use of LLM-enhanced CAI for individuals with mental health issues, focusing on the use case of patients with depression: the tendency to humanize LLM-enhanced CAI and their lack of contextualized robustness. Our approach is interdisciplinary, relying on considerations from philosophy, psychology, and computer science. We argue that the humanization of LLM-enhanced CAI hinges on the reflection of what it means to simulate “human-like” features with LLMs and what role these systems should play in interactions with humans. Further, ensuring the contextualization of the robustness of LLMs requires considering the specificities of language production in individuals with depression, as well as its evolution over time. Finally, we provide a series of recommendations to foster the responsible design and deployment of LLM-enhanced CAI for the therapeutic support of individuals with depression.}

abstract = {Background
While Emotional Intelligence (EI) demonstrably affects academic success, literature lacks exploration of how implementing chatbot in education might influence both academic performance and students' emotional intelligence, despite the evident potential of such technology.
Aim
To investigate the associations between Emotional Intelligence (EI), chatbot utilization among undergraduate students.
Methods
A cross-sectional approach was employed, utilizing a convenience sample of 529 undergraduate students recruited through online questionnaires. The participants completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and modified and a modified versions of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model.
Results
of the 529 participants, 83.6 % (n = 440) of participants regularly used chatbot for learning. Students demonstrated a moderate average EI score (129.60 ± 50.15) and an exceptionally high score (89.61 ± 20.70) for chatbot acceptance and usage. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) positive correlation was found between chatbot usage frequency and EI total score. Gender and major emerged as significant factors, with female students (p < 0.05) and health science students (p < 0.05) utilizing chatbot less compared to male and other major students, respectively. A negative correlation (r = −0.111, p = 0.011) was observed between study hours and chatbot usage, suggesting students with higher study hours relied less on chatbot.
Conclusions
The positive correlation between chatbot use and EI in this study sparks promising avenues for enhancing the learning experience. By investing in further research to understand this link and integrate AI tools thoughtfully, policymakers and educators can cultivate a learning environment that prioritizes both academic excellence and student well-being, reflecting the values and perspectives of UAE culture.}

Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most elementary learning models of machine learning. Privacy issues surrounding SVM classifier training have attracted increasing attention. In this paper, we investigate Differential Privacy-compliant Federated Machine Learning with Dimensionality Reduction, called FedDPDR-DPML, which greatly improves data utility while providing strong privacy guarantees. Considering in distributed learning scenarios, multiple participants usually hold unbalanced or small amounts of data. Therefore, FedDPDR-DPML enables multiple participants to collaboratively learn a global model based on weighted model averaging and knowledge aggregation and then the server distributes the global model to each participant to improve local data utility. Aiming at high-dimensional data, we adopt differential privacy in both the principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimensionality reduction phase and SVM classifiers training phase, which improves model accuracy while achieving strict differential privacy protection. Besides, we train Differential privacy (DP)-compliant SVM classifiers by adding noise to the objective function itself, thus leading to better data utility. Extensive experiments on three high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that FedDPDR-DPML can achieve high accuracy while ensuring strong privacy protection.}

abstract = {Objectives
To systematically evaluate the reproducibility of primary data and, the reproducibility and correctness of pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates reported in a sample of diagnostic meta-analyses.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted an exemplary systematic review of diagnostic meta-analyses comparing coronary computed tomography angiography to invasive coronary angiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The objectives were to assess 1) the reproducibility of contingency tables, 2) the reproducibility of pooled sensitivity and specificity, and 3) differences to reported results when applying a recommended bivariate binomial model for pooling sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, we reproduced the contingency tables and recalculated sensitivity and specificity by utilizing both the pooling method of each meta-analysis and a bivariate binomial model. We used linear trends to assess the improvement of these objectives over time.
Results
We identified 38 diagnostic meta-analyses, each including on average 19 primary studies (range: 3 to 89 studies; total: 715—including duplicates) with an average of approximately 1800 patients per meta-analysis (range: 118 to 7516 patients). For 31 meta-analyses (82%, 95% CI: 65%, 91%), the contingency tables were reproducible; however, only 15 published them. Using the pooling method of each meta-analysis, we obtained comparable recalculated sensitivities/specificities for 28 meta-analyses (74% [57%, 86%]). Only 11 meta-analyses pooled sensitivity/specificity using a bivariate binomial model (29% [16%, 46%]). When all meta-analyses were pooled with this model, published sensitivities/specificities were confirmed for 19 of 38 meta-analyses (50% [34%, 66%]). There was only marginal improvement in data availability and application of recommended pooling methods over time.
Conclusion
Data sharing should become standard practice along with the use of appropriate pooling methods. Journal publication requirements may play a key role in enhancing the quality of scientific reporting and methodological standards which may lead to more reliable and consistent outcomes. The ability to reproduce sensitivity and specificity estimates in diagnostic imaging meta-analyses is dependent on the availability of contingency tables and the explicit reporting of pooling methods and software used.}

Biomarkers play a central role in medicine’s gradual progress toward proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, for example, for multifactorial diseases, has been challenging. The discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types—multidimensional, time series, and erroneous data—and covers key data modalities in healthcare—electronic health records, omics, and medical images.

However, the existing deposition parameter planning methods struggle to offer continuous and precise parameters when the part geometry varies dynamically due to the long-term dependence, strong coupling, and hysteresis properties of the WAAM process. To address this challenge, this research introduces an advanced algorithm for generating accurate and continuous deposition parameters by learning and utilizing the welding skills of proficient human welders. The first step involves capturing kinematic and welding parameter data from proficient human welders during practical welding processes. Following this, a human skill learning algorithm is developed based on a combination of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) architecture and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to analyse and model human motions and bead deposition results. Lastly, a practical backward model is established to generate continuous deposition parameters for weld beads with varying geometry. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through the fabrication of two practical WAAM parts. The root mean square error (RMSE) values between the target geometry and the ground truth geometry of the parts are 0.1648 and 0.1805 respectively. The result demonstrates the algorithm's superior ability in optimal deposition parameters planning for fabricating parts with complex geometries.}

abstract = {Background
The current paradigm in mental health care focuses on clinical recovery and symptom remission. This model’s efficacy is influenced by therapist trust in patient recovery potential and the depth of the therapeutic relationship. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness with severe symptoms where the possibility of recovery is a matter of debate. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes integrated into the health care field, it is important to examine its ability to assess recovery potential in major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) in comparison to mental health professionals to assess the prognosis of schizophrenia with and without professional treatment and the long-term positive and negative outcomes.
Methods
Vignettes were inputted into LLMs interfaces and assessed 10 times by 4 AI platforms: ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Google Bard, and Claude. A total of 80 evaluations were collected and benchmarked against existing norms to analyze what mental health professionals (general practitioners, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and mental health nurses) and the general public think about schizophrenia prognosis with and without professional treatment and the positive and negative long-term outcomes of schizophrenia interventions.
Results
For the prognosis of schizophrenia with professional treatment, ChatGPT-3.5 was notably pessimistic, whereas ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard aligned with professional views but differed from the general public. All LLMs believed untreated schizophrenia would remain static or worsen without professional treatment. For long-term outcomes, ChatGPT-4 and Claude predicted more negative outcomes than Bard and ChatGPT-3.5. For positive outcomes, ChatGPT-3.5 and Claude were more pessimistic than Bard and ChatGPT-4.
Conclusions
The finding that 3 out of the 4 LLMs aligned closely with the predictions of mental health professionals when considering the “with treatment” condition is a demonstration of the potential of this technology in providing professional clinical prognosis. The pessimistic assessment of ChatGPT-3.5 is a disturbing finding since it may reduce the motivation of patients to start or persist with treatment for schizophrenia. Overall, although LLMs hold promise in augmenting health care, their application necessitates rigorous validation and a harmonious blend with human expertise.}

Specifically, we investigate the disparities in the perceived credibility of AIGC, stemming from various source types and nationalities. Using an online experiment conducted in China, we found that Chinese AI sources and human-AI hybrid sources with consistent Chinese national identity were perceived as more credible than their foreign (American) counterparts, whose effects were fully mediated by machine heuristics. In contrast, less credibility was directly attributed to human-AI hybrid sources with inconsistent human-AI nationalities (e.g., a Chinese journalist using American AI). Furthermore, although foreign sources were generally seen as less credible, the presence of AI in the source moderated this negative effect. These findings indicated users' perceptions of the political dimensions of AI technology.}

Chatbots have the potential to improve user compliance in electronic Patient-Reported Outcome (ePRO) system. Compared to rule-based chatbots, Large Language Model (LLM) offers advantages such as simplifying the development process and increasing conversational flexibility. However, there is currently a lack of practical applications of LLMs in ePRO systems. Therefore, this study utilized ChatGPT to develop the Chat-ePRO system and designed a pilot study to explore the feasibility of building an ePRO system based on LLM.
Materials and Methods
This study employed prompt engineering and offline knowledge distillation to design a dialogue algorithm and built the Chat-ePRO system on the WeChat Mini Program platform. In order to compare Chat-ePRO with the form-based ePRO and rule-based chatbot ePRO used in previous studies, we conducted a pilot study applying the three ePRO systems sequentially at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital to collect patients’ PRO data.
Result
Chat-ePRO is capable of correctly generating conversation based on PRO forms (success rate: 95.7 %) and accurately extracting the PRO data instantaneously from conversation (Macro-F1: 0.95). The majority of subjective evaluations from doctors (>70 %) suggest that Chat-ePRO is able to comprehend questions and consistently generate responses. Pilot study shows that Chat-ePRO demonstrates higher response rate (9/10, 90 %) and longer interaction time (10.86 s/turn) compared to the other two methods.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing algorithms such as prompt engineering to drive LLM in completing ePRO data collection tasks, and validated that the Chat-ePRO system can effectively enhance patient compliance.}

The NLP algorithm (Radnosis, VEEV, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) subdivided each report's Impression into “phrases”, with multiple ICD-10 matches for each phrase. Only viewing the Impression, the physician reviewers selected the single best ICD-10 code for each phrase. Codes selected by the physicians and algorithm were compared for agreement.
Results
The algorithm extracted the reports' Impressions into 645 phrases, each having ranked ICD-10 matches. Regarding the reviewers' selected codes, pairwise agreement was unreliable (Krippendorff α = 0.39-0.63). Using unanimous reviewer agreement as “ground truth”, the algorithm's sensitivity/specificity/F2 for top 5 codes was 0.88/0.80/0.83, and for the single best code was 0.67/0.82/0.67. The engine tabulated “pertinent negatives” as negative codes for stated findings (e.g. “no intracranial hemorrhage”). The engine's matching was more specific for shorter than full-length ICD-10 codes (p = 0.00582x10−3).
Conclusions
Manual coding by physician reviewers has significant variability and is time-consuming, while the NLP algorithm's top 5 diagnosis codes are relatively accurate. This preliminary work demonstrates the feasibility and potential for generating codes with reliability and consistency. Future works may include correlating diagnosis codes with clinical encounter codes to evaluate imaging's impact on, and relevance to care.}

However, traditional glucose monitoring methods suffer from invasiveness, discomfort, and potential infection. This paper introduces an innovative approach that utilizes non-invasive data sources derived from wearable devices, namely Photoplethysmography (PPG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and skin temperature (ST), in combination with user-provided food logs. The proposed model, MMG-Net, uses the three waveforms along with food features extracted from food logs to estimate blood glucose levels. MMG-Net delivers exceptional performance metrics, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of 13.51 mg/dL, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 12.57 %, and a Root Mean Square Error of 17.26 mg/dL. Notably, MMG-Net outperforms existing solutions in the estimation of blood glucose levels, solidifying its status as an innovative approach. The model's clinical precision is substantiated through Clarke Error Grid analysis, with a remarkable 99.43 % of predictions falling within clinically acceptable ranges. This paper presents a substantial advancement in non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, offering a promising avenue for enhanced disease management among hyperglycemic patients with only wearable devices.}

However, its layout design often relies on traditional paradigms, leading to significant inefficiencies in manpower and material utilization. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework based on diffusion models, named FrameDiffusion. Leveraging the concept of transfer learning, this framework employs the Kronecker product to perform low-rank decomposition of the parameter matrix in a general large model, enabling cost-effective learning of component layout features on small-scale multimodal datasets. Furthermore, FrameDiffusion integrates the ControlNet model, facilitating the layout design of columns and braces in steel frame-braced structures under varying design conditions.

SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine signaling by negatively regulating JAK/STAT. We investigated this host-pathogen dialectic at the level of transcription. We used phorbol-differentiated THP-1 Mϕ infected with Mtb to investigate preferential upregulation of some SOCS isoforms that are known to inhibit signaling by IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-6. We examined time kinetics of likely transcription factors and signaling molecules upstream of SOCS transcription, and survival of intracellular Mtb following SOCS upregulation. Our results suggest a plausible mechanism that involves PGE2 secretion during infection to induce the PKA/CREB axis, culminating in nuclear translocation of C/EBPβ to induce expression of SOCS1. Mtb-infected Mϕ secreted IL-10, suggesting a mechanism of induction of STAT3, which may subsequently induce SOCS3. We provide evidence of temporal variation in SOCS isoform exspression and decay. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of SOCS1 and SOCS3 restored the pro-inflammatory milieu and reduced Mtb viability. In mice infected with Mtb, SOCS isoforms persisted across Days 28–85 post infection. Our results suggest that differential temporal regulation of SOCS isoforms by Mtb drives the host immune response towards a phenotype that facilitates the pathogen's survival.}

abstract = {Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advances in immunotherapies and targeted treatments for HCC, chemotherapy remains a valuable first-line treatment. However, the efficacy of immunotherapy compared to that of chemotherapy is unknown. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of chemotherapy and immunotherapy on survival outcomes, response rates, and adverse effects.
Methods
A thorough literature search of multiple electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from database inception to February 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared first-line chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cisplatin, tislelizumab, sorafenib, and fluorouracil) with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) for advanced HCC. Two reviewers independently identified the studies, obtained relevant information, and assessed the possibility of bias. The hazard ratios (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were merged using random effects meta-analysis.
Results
Twenty studies with 1183 patients were examined. All studies had a high risk of bias. According to a meta-analysis, immunotherapy was linked to a significantly better PFS than chemotherapy (HR: 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–2.00, I2 = 32%). OS showed a similar trend, although the difference was not statistically significant (HR: 1.26, 95% CI 0.96–1.66, I2 = 0%). Sensitivity analysis revealed that immunotherapy continued to improve PFS compared to chemotherapy while having no discernible effect on OS.
Conclusions
First-line immunotherapy may offer PFS advantages over chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced HCC. However, a high risk of bias limits definitive conclusions. Larger, higher-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the potential benefits of OS and minimize bias. Although chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment in regions with limited access, the widespread availability of immunotherapy makes it essential to compare both treatments to determine the most appropriate first-line option for advanced HCC.}

abstract = {Introduction
This study investigates the anticancer, photodynamic, antioxidant efficiency and molecular interaction profiles of Onosma aucheriana methanol extract.
Method
The cell viability of normal (HEK293) and gastric cancer (MKN28) cell lines was evaluated using IC50 values, including photodynamic activity under green light. Antioxidant potential was assessed through DPPH radical scavenging, while phytochemical contents were quantified spectrophotometrically. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis identified major compounds, and molecular docking studies explored their interactions with target proteins.
Results
Cell viability assays showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability, with IC50 values of 1036 μg/mL for HEK293 and 951.8 μg/mL for MKN28. To assess photodynamic activity, green light was used, revealing IC50 values of 56.62 μg/mL for normal cells and 32.53 μg/mL for cancer cells. A more pronounced reduction in cell viability was observed in cancer cells compared to normal cells. However, it demonstrates significant photodynamic activity at a concentration approximately 1/18th of the IC50 value for normal cells and about 1/29th of the IC50 value for cancer cells. The extract, with a DPPH radical scavenging IC₅₀ value of 154.15 ± 1.04 µg/mL, exhibits strong antioxidant activity, which is greater than that of BHT (230 ± 10 µg/mL). The total flavanol, flavonoid, phenolic, proanthocyanidin, and tannin contents are quantified as 24.30 ± 1.23 mg QE/g, 32.96 ± 3.23 mg QE/g, 6.31 ± 0.79 mg GAE/g, 83.41 ± 12.95 mg CAE/g, and 27.32 ± 2.30 mg GAE/g, respectively. GC–MS analysis reveals inositol (30.47 %), 4-((1E)‑hydroxy-1-propenyl)-2-methoxyphenol (23.04 %), 3-amino-2,6-dimethylpyridine (7.41 %), and 3-buten-2-one, 4-(4‑hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0] hept‑1-yl) (5.99 %) as major components. Molecular docking studies reveal that 3-buten-2-one, 4-(4‑hydroxy-2,2,6-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0] hept‑1-yl) exhibits strong binding interactions with BAF complex (6LTJ), inositol shows substantial hydrogen bonding, and 4-((1E)‑hydroxy-1-propenyl)-2-methoxyphenol demonstrates significant binding with several receptors.
Conclusion
The O. aucheriana extract exhibited strong antioxidant activity and a novel photodynamic cytotoxic effect that became prominent under green light exposure. These findings suggest that the extract may possess versatile therapeutic potential.}

Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design, the quantitative phase compares the accuracy of automated versus manual linguistic annotation in evaluating the pragmatic skills of EFL learners. In the qualitative phase, factors influencing the accuracy of manual annotation are explored. For automated annotation, ChatGPT-4 Omni (ChatGPT-4o) processed 116 transcriptions representing participants' performances across six verbal discourse completion tasks (DCTs), encompassing prosodic features and pragmatic functions such as requesting favors, apologizing, suggesting, complaining, inviting, and refusing invitations. The AI model was fine-tuned using a human-in-the-loop approach, incorporating ensemble techniques such as few-shot learning and instructional prompts. Manual annotation employed trained EFL teachers using standardized assessment cards. Results indicate that automated annotation surpasses manual accuracy in evaluating most pragmatic components, except cultural norms, where both methods exhibit limitations. Focus group findings reveal that annotator bias, fatigue, technological influences, linguistic background differences, and subjectivity impact manual annotation accuracy. This interdisciplinary investigation expands the methodological toolkit for pragmatic competence evaluation and holds significant implications for fields such as digital humanities, computational pragmatics, language education, machine learning, and natural language processing.}

This study aims to establish the correlation between shifts in serum trace element (TE) levels and the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), while also exploring the underlying causal relationship between these variables.
Methods
An investigation was conducted, which included a systematic review, a meta-analysis of observational studies, and a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study.
Results
This meta-analysis revealed significant differences in serum levels of copper, manganese, cadmium, and selenium between OA patients and healthy controls, after adjusting for heterogeneity. Specifically, significant disparities were observed for copper (SMD 0.118 [95 % CI: 0.061 ∼ 0.175], P < 0.001), manganese (SMD −0.180 [95 % CI: −0.326 ∼ −0.034], P = 0.016), cadmium (SMD 0.227 [95 % CI: 0.131 ∼ 0.322], P < 0.001), and selenium (SMD −0.138 [95 % CI: −0.209 ∼ −0.068], P < 0.001), while zinc levels did not show a significant difference (SMD −0.02 [95 % CI: −0.077 ∼ 0.038], P = 0.503). Further, MR analysis suggested a causal link between genetically predicted serum copper level changes and OA development, but not for other TEs.
Conclusion
The study suggests that there is an association between the occurrence of OA and variations in serum levels of copper, manganese, cadmium, and selenium. Elevated serum copper may play a pivotal role. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic potential of TE level modulation in OA management.}

abstract = {The small-scale fisheries along the northern region of the Panay Gulf face a distinctive challenge as multiple communities compete for access to the same fishing areas and resources. In response, neighboring coastal municipalities implemented conventional management measures, such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and seasonal closures, aiming to enhance the abundance of fisheries resources. However, these measures only imposed economic hardships on artisanal fishermen. To address this issue, a survey involving 135 informants from coastal barangays was conducted between June to November 2021. The study used semi-structured questionnaires and GPS data loggers to collect essential information on the spatial and temporal distribution of fishing activities and specific target catches. The integration of local knowledge played a crucial role in bridging critical data gaps within the study site, facilitating the identification of more effective management reforms. The findings revealed that traditional harvest locations for various gear types exhibited zonation patterns across the gulf. Fishing activities were strategically conducted in areas with available resources, often disregarding municipal fishing boundaries. Coordinated management strategies are deemed imperative due to the varying timing of seasonal closures among municipalities. On the other hand, the temporal analysis of fishing activities revealed peak seasons of fisheries resources, providing a basis for adjusting the selection of target species and the duration of seasonal closures. Interestingly, the existing management measures failed to reduce the annual fishing activities and were ineffective, contrary to popular claims. This outcome was primarily due to constant shifts in the types of fishing gear used and target catches between seasons, highlighting the displacement of exploitation. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of aligning fisheries policies with the dynamic nature of small-scale fisheries. Unless these policies adapt to the evolving conditions of the sector, they are likely to remain ineffective in addressing issues faced by artisanal fishermen in the region.}

abstract = {Amid the global surge in generative AI and the resulting compute revolution, thermal management has emerged to be a pivotal determinant of its success. Innovation in thermal interface materials (TIMs) now represents a strategic frontier in shaping the trajectory of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Conventional silicone-based TIMs face a performance dilemma comprising thermal cycling-induced interfacial delamination, aging-related increases in interfacial thermal resistance. Building on previous work that introduced poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) as a novel alternative to silicones, this study further optimizes the molecular structure of PILs. Incorporation of ethoxy groups significantly enhances the mechanical compliance of PIL while maintaining high adhesion strength. Robust hydrogen bonding between ethoxy groups in PIL and liquid metal enables a high loading of 82 vol% without leakage, achieving a thermal conductivity of nearly 5 W m−1 K−1. Meanwhile, strong interfacial adhesion yields a interface contact thermal resistance of 0.74 ± 0.12 × 10-6 m2·K/W between the PIL/LM composite and Si, lower than that of silicone-based TIMs. The noncovalent self-healing of the PIL matrix effectively prevents crack formation in TIMs during aging. This work advances the application of PILs in TIMs and provides strategies for performance optimization, paving the way for their practical deployment as viable matrix alternatives.}

abstract = {The personal, social and economic burden of chronic pain is enormous. Tremendous research efforts are being directed toward understanding, preventing, and managing chronic pain. Yet patients with chronic pain, clinicians and the public are sometimes poorly served by an evidence architecture that contains multiple structural weaknesses. These include incomplete research governance, a lack of diversity and inclusivity, inadequate stakeholder engagement, poor methodological rigour and incomplete reporting, a lack of data accessibility and transparency, and a failure to communicate findings with appropriate balance. These issues span pre-clinical research, clinical trials and systematic reviews and impact the development of clinical guidance and practice. Research misconduct and inauthentic data present a further critical risk. Combined, they increase uncertainty in this highly challenging area of study and practice, drive the provision of low value care, increase costs and impede the discovery of more effective solutions. In this focus article, we explore how we can increase trust in pain science, by examining critical challenges using contemporary examples, and describe a novel integrated conceptual framework for enhancing the trustworthiness of pain science. We end with a call for collective action to address this critical issue.
Perspective
Multiple challenges can adversely impact the trustworthiness of pain research and health research more broadly. We present ENTRUST-PE, a novel, integrated framework for more trustworthy pain research with recommendations for all stakeholders in the research ecosystem, and make a call to action to the pain research community.}

To study this, adults receiving hemodialysis for three months or more with hyperkalemia (pre-dialysis sK+ 5.1–6.5 mmol/l) had cardiac monitors implanted and were randomized to either eight weeks of 2.0 mmol/l potassium/1.25 mmol/l calcium dialysate without sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) (2.0 potassium/noSZC) or 3.0 mmol/l potassium/1.25 mmol/l calcium dialysate combined with SZC (3.0 potassium/SZC) on non-dialysis days to maintain pre-dialysis sK+ 4.0–5.5 mmol/l, followed by treatment crossover for another eight weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of adjudicated atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes of at least 2 minutes duration. Secondary outcomes included clinically significant arrhythmias (bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and/or asystole) and the proportion of sK+ measurements within an optimal window of 4.0–5.5 mmol/l. Among 88 participants (mean age: 57.1 years; 51% male; mean pre-dialysis sK+: 5.5 mmol/l) with 25.5 person-years of follow-up, 296 AF episodes were detected in nine patients. The unadjusted AF rate was lower with 3.0 potassium/SZC versus 2.0 potassium/noSZC; 9.7 vs. 13.4/person-year (modeled rate ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.41–0.65). Clinically significant arrhythmias were reduced with 3.0 potassium/SZC vs. 2.0 potassium/noSZC (6.8 vs. 10.2/person-year modeled rate ratio 0.47; 0.38; 0.58). Fewer sK+ measurements outside the optimal window occurred with 3.0 potassium/SZC (modeled odds ratio: 0.27; 0.21–0.35). Hypokalemia was less frequent (33 vs. 58 patients) with 3.0 potassium/SZC compared with 2.0 potassium/noSZC. Thus, in patients with hyperkalemia on maintenance hemodialysis, a combination of hemodialysate potassium 3.0 mmol/l and SZC on non-hemodialysis days reduced the rates of AF, other clinically significant arrhythmias, and post-dialysis hypokalemia compared with hemodialysate potassium 2.0/noSZC.}

The role of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in the management of HCM has expanded over the past 2 decades to become a key informant of risk in this patient population, delivering unique insights into tissue health and its influence on future outcomes. Numerous mature CMR-based techniques are clinically available for the interrogation of tissue health in patients with HCM, inclusive of contrast and noncontrast methods. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging remains a cornerstone technique for the identification and quantification of myocardial fibrosis with large cumulative evidence supporting value for the prediction of arrhythmic outcomes. T1 mapping delivers improved fidelity for fibrosis quantification through direct estimations of extracellular volume fraction but also offers potential for noncontrast surrogate assessments of tissue health. Water-sensitive imaging, inclusive of T2-weighted dark blood imaging and T2 mapping, have also shown preliminary potential for assisting in risk discrimination. Finally, emerging techniques, inclusive of innovative multiparametric methods, are expanding the utility of CMR to assist in the delivery of comprehensive tissue characterization toward the delivery of personalized HCM care. In this narrative review we summarize the contemporary landscape of CMR techniques aimed at characterizing tissue health in patients with HCM. The value of these respective techniques to identify patients at elevated risk of future cardiovascular outcomes are highlighted.
Résumé
La cardiomyopathie hypertrophique (CMH) est une cardiomyopathie héréditaire courante qui affecte entre 1 : 200 et 1 : 500 de la population générale. Le rôle de l'imagerie par résonance magnétique cardiovasculaire (IRM-C) dans la prise en charge de la CMH s'est développé au cours des deux dernières décennies pour devenir un élément clé informant du risque pour cette population de patients, fournissant des informations uniques relatives à la santé des tissus et son influence sur les pronostics. De nombreuses techniques matures basées sur l'IRM-C sont disponibles en clinique pour examiner l'état de santé des tissus chez les patients atteints de CMH, incluant des méthodes avec et sans contraste. L'imagerie de rehaussement tardif au gadolinium reste une technique de base pour l'identification et la quantification de la fibrose myocardique, avec de nombreuses preuves cumulées soutenant sa valeur pour la prédiction des résultats arythmiques. La cartographie T1 offre une fidélité améliorée pour la quantification de la fibrose grâce à des estimations directes de la fraction du volume extracellulaire, mais elle offre également un potentiel pour des évaluations substitutives sans contraste de l'état de santé du tissu. L'imagerie, sensible au contenu en eau des tissus, y compris l'imagerie à contraste « sang noir » pondérée en T2 et la cartographie du temps de relaxation transversal T2, a également montré un potentiel préliminaire pour aider à la discrimination du risque. Enfin, les techniques émergentes, incluant des méthodes multiparamétriques innovantes, élargissent l'utilité de l'IRM-C pour aider à la caractérisation complète des tissus en vue d'une prise en charge personnalisée de la CMH. Dans cette revue narrative, nous résumons le panorama actuel des techniques d'IRM-C visant à caractériser l'état de santé des tissus chez les patients atteints de CMH. L'intérêt de ces techniques respectives pour identifier les patients présentant un risque élevé d'effets cardiovasculaires futurs est mis en évidence.}

In Experiment 1, using seven pigeons, the effect of stimulus continuity, the presentation of the same stimulus (background color of the computer screen) during the post-reinforcer delay period as in the pre-reinforcer delay period, was examined. In Experiment 2, the effect of stimulus continuity was examined under the conditions where a response was required (FR 1) to initiate the post-reinforcer delay using eight pigeons. The experimental results indicated that when the same stimulus as in the pre-reinforcer delay was presented continuously during the post-reinforcer delay and a response was required to start the post-reinforcer delay, the subjects showed relatively high sensitivity to differences between post-reinforcer delays. The implications of the results are discussed from a new perspective for the analysis of self-control choices.}

This study aims to investigate the degree of correlated responses to selection between hands and feet and to determine whether one of the autopods has exerted a greater influence on this coevolution, focusing on their homologous elements and morphological traits. We analyzed the 38 long bones of the hands and feet from 96 modern human specimens, employing a comprehensive methodological framework that includes morphological analysis, assessments of modularity, integration, and covariation patterns under random selection. Additionally, Bayesian analyses were conducted to test whether foot morphology drives hand morphology or vice versa. Our findings indicate a high degree of morphological integration between the hands and feet, revealing a trend of increasing correlation from the first to the fifth ray. Consistent with previous studies, our Bayesian model provides robust evidence that the feet drive the morphological coevolution of human autopods, likely in response to functional selection pressures associated with bipedalism. However, our results also highlight that the intertwined evolutionary trajectories of the hands and feet are not a simple unidirectional model, underscoring the complexity of morphological integration and the diverse coevolutionary patterns among different rays, reflecting their specialized functions and evolutionary adaptations.}

abstract = {During the large-scale fracturing and exploitation of unconventional reservoirs, artificial fractures progressively widen in reservoirs with natural fracture development, which is highly prone to fracture leakage between segment clusters, thereby impacting the complexity of fracture networks. Nevertheless, the existing research on the evaluation model of fracture leakage in the fracturing process is limited and lacks precise predictive capabilities. The model has been developed to assess the variations in bottom hole pressure and bottom hole temperature during fracture extension by considering the combined effects of pressure loss, temperature exchange, along-track drag, static column pressure, and integrated heat transfer among the fracturing fluid, tubing wall, annulus, casing wall, and formation. The model is capable of evaluating the occurrence of fracture leakage by analyzing the extent of temperature and pressure variations at the base of the wellbore. The study findings compare the temperature and pressure data from 14 out of 144 actual fracture leakage sections of three wells monitored in an oilfield, and it is believed that the situation of fracture leakage can be identified when the predicted temperature changes fall within the range of −2.95 °C–7.53 °C, and the predicted pressure changes range from −0.87 MPa to 6.55 MPa. The model yields an average error of 4.09% for pressure and 5.73% for temperature. Moreover, the model demonstrates high overall prediction accuracy, which holds significant implications for promptly identifying inter-segmental fracture leakage and facilitating the efficient development of oil and gas fields.}

The synthesized INBIL showed a 'turn off' luminescent property that has been used to detect picric acid. This luminescent sensor has a broad emission band at 415 nm in acetonitrile due to the conjugation of its double bond. It is worth noting that INBIL can be recycled through TEA treatment. The chemosensor exhibited the highest sensitivity with Ksv = 1.51 × 10−6 M, and a detection limit of 2.91 × 10−7 M, with perfect linearity up to 22 µL.

Background
There is a need for new tools for monitoring of the response to TB treatment. Such tools may allow for tailored treatment regimens, and stratify patients initiating TB treatment into different risk groups. We evaluated combinations between previously published host biomarkers and new candidates, as tools for monitoring TB treatment response, and prediction of relapse.
Methods
Serum samples were collected at multiple time points, from patients initiating TB treatment at research sites situated in South Africa (ActionTB study), Brazil and Uganda (TBRU study). Using a multiplex immunoassay platform, we evaluated the concentrations of selected host inflammatory biomarkers in sera obtained from clinically cured patients with and without subsequent relapse within 2 years of TB treatment completion.
Results
A total of 130 TB patients, 30 (23%) of whom had confirmed relapse were included in the study. The median time to relapse was 9.7 months in the ActionTB study (n = 12 patients who relapsed), and 5 months (n = 18 patients who relapsed) in the TBRU study. Serum concentrations of several host biomarkers changed during TB treatment with IL-6, IP-10, IL-22 and complement C3 showing potential individually, in predicting relapse. A six-marker signature comprising of TTP, BMI, sICAM-1, IL-22, IL-1β and complement C3, predicted relapse, prior to the onset of TB treatment with 89% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Furthermore, a 3-marker signature (Apo-CIII, IP-10 and sIL-6R) predicted relapse in samples collected at the end of TB treatment with sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 74%. A previously identified baseline relapse prediction signature (TTP, BMI, TNF-β, sIL-6R, IL-12p40 and IP-10) also showed potential in the current study.
Conclusion
Serum host inflammatory biomarkers may be useful in predicting relapse in TB patients prior to the initiation of treatment. Our findings have implications for tailored patient management and require prospective evaluation in larger studies.}
