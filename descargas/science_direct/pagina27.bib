abstract = {Introduction
The rising prevalence of obesity is of particular concern due to its association with a range of serious complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer. Obesity medications can control the disease but it is unclear how patients choose which medication to use.
Methods
A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to investigate how patients select between obesity medications. Fifteen treatment naive adults with a body mass index ≥27 kg/m2 with at least one weight-related complications were recruited.
Results
The 5 major themes depicting how patients make selections included 1) Effectiveness of medication, 2) Information to make decisions, 3) Safety of medications, 4) Practicality and 5) Individual Strategies and Community Supports in Obesity Management. Safety concerns of side effects and long-term risks were perceived major barriers to initiating or adhering to pharmacotherapy.
Conclusion
In a situation where the medications are described as being free and readily available, patient preferences for obesity medications are shaped by treatment efficacy, safety, information provided by healthcare providers. To enhance adherence and improve patient outcomes, healthcare providers should focus on delivering clear, comprehensive information and fostering strong support systems for patients.}

abstract = {Introduction
Bloodletting therapy (BLT), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) non-pharmaceutical therapy, may have a good antipyretic effect, but the evidence has not been evaluated. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the antipyretic effect and safety of TCM BLT used in patients with infections.
Methods
The protocol of this review was registered in PROSPERO (No.CRD42023411059). We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BLT alone or in combination with another therapy to controls (no treatment or usual care). A search of CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Sinomed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases was conducted up to March 2023. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and GRADE were used for assessing methodological quality of included trials and certainty of evidence.
Result
Fourteen RCTs (1419 participants) were included. BLT (either used alone or as add on therapy) was superior to drugs alone in increasing antipyretic rate and lowering the body temperature only for adults. For children or when combined with pediatric Tuina or herbal medicine, its advantages were not shown. The fever clearance time may be shortened (Mean Difference (MD)=-7.59 h, 95 %CI -12.73 h to -2.44 h, 194 participants, I2=69 %, 3 trials, P = 0.004) and the commencement of fever abatement (MD=-1.48 h, 95 %CI -2.02 h to -0.94 h, 134 participants, I2=0 %, 2 trials, P < 0.00001) improved when used as an adjunctive treatment with pediatric Tuina. Safety of BLT to treat fever was still unclear since few trials reported this relevant outcome. Certainty of evidence was very low.
Conclusion
The long-term (24hrs+) antipyretic effect of BLT alone and combined with drugs may be better than that of drugs alone for adults. For children combining BLT and pediatric Tuina/herbal medicine was no better in increasing antipyretic rate compared to pediatric Tuina/herbal medicine alone. Current evidence does not provide firm conclusions about the safety of BLT.}

abstract = {As global energy demand rises and environmental problems worsen, energy optimization in intelligent buildings has become a key research focus. This paper combines generative AI technology with 3D modeling to propose a spatial design method for energy optimization of intelligent buildings. This method employs generative AI to enhance the spatial layout of the building and iteratively optimizes energy consumption in the design scheme through several rounds of refinement. Experiments show that the design scheme using this method can significantly reduce building energy consumption. The energy consumption of the intelligent optimization design solution is 600 kWh lower than that of the traditional design solution across several types of buildings, including office buildings, residential areas, and public spaces. This reduction was observed under varying environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, highlighting the adaptability and effectiveness of the intelligent optimization design solution. In addition, a comparative analysis of multiple building configurations and external environmental factors, such as varying spatial layouts, solar panel usage, and insulation materials, further validates the applicability of this intelligent design approach in different building types and operational settings. In addition, with the increase of spatial layout optimization, building energy efficiency has been improved, and the energy efficiency improvement ratio in some areas is close to 20 %. Solar photovoltaic panels offer the most significant energy efficiency improvement, increasing efficiency by 30 % with a long service life. Other renewable energy sources, such as geothermal and bioenergy, also enhance efficiency. Geothermal energy, for instance, improves efficiency by 20 % to 45 %, depending on location and system integration, and is particularly effective in climates with seasonal temperature variations, reducing heating and cooling energy demand. The optimization solution combining generative AI and 3D modeling not only improves the energy efficiency of buildings, but also provides a sustainable and low-carbon building design path. Through intelligent optimization, buildings can achieve lower energy consumption and higher energy utilization efficiency during use, providing strong technical support for the realization of green buildings.}

abstract = {The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping technological pathways in the global energy transition. While AI holds great potential to enhance the efficiency, resilience, and integration of renewable energy systems, its effective deployment depends heavily on supportive financial structures. Moreover, empirical assessments of AI’s macroeconomic impact are limited by the absence of standardized, internationally comparable measures of AI development. To address this problem, we construct a multidimensional AI composite index using the projection pursuit method, integrating eleven indicators across scientific innovation, infrastructure support, and global competitiveness. The index spans 119 countries from 2010 to 2022, offering improved spatial-temporal coverage for global analysis. Using this dataset, we empirically investigate the effect of AI on renewable energy transition and explore the mediating and threshold roles of financial development. We apply a suite of econometric models, including fixed-effect regression, mediation effect regression, dynamic threshold effect regression, and robustness check using industrial robot proxies and GMM. Results show that AI development significantly promotes the energy transition toward renewables. This finding holds true in both low-income and high-income countries. However, the role of financial development is twofold: it mediates AI’s impact, but in its current fossil fuel–biased form, may also exert a suppressive effect on green transformation. Notably, once financial development surpasses a critical threshold, the influence of AI on energy transition is amplified. Our findings offer new insights into the interaction between digital innovation and sustainable finance, and provide timely evidence for designing financial and technological policies that support AI-driven renewable energy transition.}

However, the complex optimizations required for successful TinyML deployment continue to impede its widespread adoption. A promising route to simplifying TinyML is through automatic machine learning (AutoML), which can distill elaborate optimization workflows into accessible key decisions. Notably, Hardware Aware Neural Architecture Searches — where a computer searches for an optimal TinyML model based on predictive performance and hardware metrics — have gained significant traction, producing some of today’s most widely used TinyML models. TinyML systems operate under extremely tight resource constraints, such as a few kB of memory and an energy consumption in the mW range. In this tight design space, the choice of input data configuration offers an attractive accuracy-latency tradeoff. Achieving truly optimal TinyML systems thus requires jointly tuning both input data and model architecture. Despite its importance, this “Data Aware Neural Architecture Search” remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a new state-of-the-art Data Aware Neural Architecture Search technique and demonstrate its effectiveness on the novel TinyML “Wake Vision” dataset. Our experiments show that across varying time and hardware constraints, Data Aware Neural Architecture Search consistently discovers superior TinyML systems compared to purely architecture-focused methods, underscoring the critical role of data-aware optimization in advancing TinyML.}

abstract = {Introduction A definitive cure for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains elusive. Inter and Intra-patient heterogeneity in antigen expression profiles is a major challenge for AML treatment. Adapter CAR-T cell therapies utilize a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) which binds to a non-natural small molecule, which in turn can be attached to a soluble affinity domain that binds the tumor antigen. Decoupling cancer cell binding and CAR engagement provides flexibility and control in directing the CAR-T therapy through dosing of the adapter, which can improve safety and decrease T cell exhaustion. A critical challenge for the success of adapter CAR-T is finding an ideal adapter molecule. Antibodies and antibody-derived molecules have been used, but this strategy is sub-optimal. Labeling antibodies with small molecules is not site-specific and only a portion of the small molecule will be in the correct orientation to activate the CAR-T. In addition, these natural proteins present a number of flaws including low stability, high internalization, and poor tumor penetrance. De novo designed miniproteins are a novel therapeutic modality. They are approximately 45 amino acids in length and adopt a highly stable tertiary structure, are easily produced recombinantly or synthetically, and present many additional advantages over traditional biologics. The structure of the miniprotein is created from scratch using generative artificial intelligence and is therefore controllable, permitting specific design of the conjugation site, as well as precise tuning the affinity. The small size, high solubility, and compact structure confers better biodistribution and lower internalization in the tumor cell surface. Additionally, de novo-designed miniproteins are superior to any biologic on the manufacturing side, since they can be expressed on common hosts, easily purified, and conjugated to small molecules efficiently and specifically using harsh methods that would denature or destroy a natural protein. Here, we show that miniproteins outperform antibodies as the targeting moiety of an adapter CAR-T therapy, and we demonstrate this using CD123 directed treatment of AML. Results We engineered AIP26GQ, a 5.6 kDa miniprotein that binds selectively to CD123 with KD = 0.5 pM. AIP26GQ is thermostable, able to be produced recombinantly from Escherichia coli or using solid phase peptide synthesis, and conjugated to a fluorescein molecule (FITC) via an engineered lysine residue. We demonstrated that AIP26GQ can direct anti-FITC CAR-T cells to kill AML model cell lines (MV-4-11) in vitro. We evaluated multiple positions for selective attachment of FITC, and identified the optimal geometric orientation for maximizing CAR-T activation. In vivo efficacy studies using MV-4-11 in NCG mice showed that AIP26GQ-directed CAR-T treatment reduces tumor burden to background levels and the remission is stable at least 15 days after the last dose. In the same study, a talacotuzumab antibody based adapter molecule and a direct anti-CD123 CAR-T were used for comparison. The miniprotein-directed CAR exhibited multiple advantages over both the antibody and the direct CAR-T, including increased efficacy with lower dose required of both the adapter and the CAR-T cells, improved tumor occupation, and less CAR-T exhaustion. Conclusions Our system combining a FITC-conjugated miniprotein with anti-FITC CAR-T cells yields complete remission in an MV-4-11 xenograft mice model, outperforming both an antibody adapter and direct CAR-T approaches. We demonstrated that the use of controllable CAR-T cells combined with miniprotein adapters exhibits an unprecedented potential for the design of dosable, redirectable and multiplexable cancer treatments.}

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
The role of MR imaging in patients with cognitive impairment is to evaluate each component of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), small vessel disease (SVD), and glymphatic function. We want to validate the diagnostic performance of the comprehensive interpretation of these parameters to predict the cognitive impairment stage.
Materials and Methods
This retrospective single-center study included 359 patients with cognitive impairment who had undergone MRI (FLAIR, T2WI, 3D-T1WI, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) and a neuropsychological screening battery between January 2020 and July 2022. Each AD and SVD-related MR parameter was visually evaluated, and DTI analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index was calculated. Volumetry analysis was performed using Neurophet AQUA AI-based software. Using logistic regression analysis, four types of models were developed and compared by adding the components in the following order: (1) clinical factors and AD, (2) SVD, (3) glymphatic function-related MR parameters, and (4) volumetric data. Chi-square automatic interaction detection algorithm was used to develop diagnostic tree analysis (DTA) model to predict late-stage cognitive impairment.
Results
APOE4 status, years of education, medial temporal lobe atrophy score, Fazekas scale score, DTI-ALPS index, and white matter hyperintensity were significant predictors of late-stage cognitive impairment. The performance of the prediction model increased from Model 1 to Model 4 (AUC: 0.880, 0.899, 0.914, and 0.945, respectively). The overall accuracy of the DTA model was 87.47%.
Conclusion
Integrative brain MRI assessments in patients with cognitive impairment, AD, SVD, and glymphatic function-related MR parameters, improve the prediction of late-stage cognitive impairment.}

However, the mechanisms underlying the achievement of flow experience in this context remain underexplored. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how GAI-IDLE influences flow experience through the lens of three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Specifically, we aim to examine the mediating effects of these psychological needs on the relationship between GAI-IDLE and flow experience. To achieve this, we conducted a survey among 333 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners from various colleges in China. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with Smart PLS 4.0 software, our results show that GenAI literacy and English proficiency positively and directly impacted flow experience, while gender had no direct effect. GAI-IDLE directly predicted flow experience and positively influenced autonomy and relatedness, which in turn directly enhanced flow experience. Thus, GAI-IDLE indirectly affected flow experience through the mediation of autonomy and relatedness. However, contrary to SDT, GAI-IDLE did not directly affect competence, and competence did not directly influence flow experience, resulting in an insignificant mediating role for competence. We discuss potential explanations for these findings and conclude with educational implications.}

abstract = {This article reviews two highly prevalent medical conditions: abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), highlighting their impact on women's health and quality of life. It is noted that AUB, particularly HMB, is associated with iron deficiency and anemia, which not only affect physical health but also emotional well-being and work productivity. The importance of early detection and appropriate management to prevent long-term complications is emphasized. The article reviews the physiology of menstrual bleeding, the structural and non-structural causes of AUB according to the PALM-COEIN classification, and the relevance of iron metabolism in these conditions. Additionally, it discusses the epidemiology of AUB and HMB, noting that these conditions are underdiagnosed, which perpetuates their negative impact. Methods for diagnosing HMB in clinical practice are proposed, including qualitative tools such as questionnaires, and the importance of a comprehensive approach that considers the impact of bleeding on patients’ quality of life is highlighted. Finally, treatment strategies for HMB and iron deficiency are discussed, emphasizing the need for individualized and appropriate management.}

The concurrent use and ethical awareness of ChatGPT among pharmacy students are examined in detail in this study. During the academic year 2023–2024, a cross-sectional survey was conducted with 413 pharmacy students from different universities in Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire evaluated their perception and impressions, as well as literacy levels about ChatGPT, together with its proper applications in this professional field of study. Based on the awareness levels of ChatGPT, participants were split into two groups for comparison. It was revealed that a sizable proportion of students (62.55%) were unaware of the concepts and their use. However, students with prior experience using ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of awareness. Nonetheless, on pharmacy-related issues, only 57.7% of participants thought that ChatGPT's responses and information were either somewhat or to some extent appropriate. However, a number of participants (52.3%) had doubts and worries regarding the using ChatGPT. The majority of the participants (78.0%) thought that ChatGPT would have a beneficial effect on pharmacy education regardless of the pending concerns. Only 1.2% and 2.7% of total participants correctly identified the problematic and appropriate applications of ChatGPT, respectively, which indicated an insufficient literacy and ethical awareness about the use of ChatGPT. These results demonstrated a critical need for improved education and training for ChatGPT use, which also warranted more precise recommendations for ethical applications of ChatGPT. It is imperative to fill the educational gaps for a better profession-bound ethical use of ChatGPT. The current ChatGPT use status, including current levels of ethical considerations, guidelines for better ethical use, prospects, and recommendations for enhancing ChatGPT use, are outlined.}

Decision-making is important in user-involved maternity care and patient experience instruments Mothers Autonomy in Decision Making scale (MADM) and Mothers on Respect index (MORi) are used internationally to measure the user involvement quality and users’ experiences of autonomy and respect. This study aimed to translate and qualitatively adapt the original MADM and MORi instruments to the Danish language and culture.
Methods
A forward and backward translation using a standard guideline. Subsequently, qualitative interviews to refine the translation and cultural adaptation by pilot testing the scales.
Results
The translation process showed cultural differences linked to linguistic variations between Danish and English. Cognitive interviews with 14 diverse pregnant women revealed challenges in women's understanding of decision-making in maternity care. Changes in wording and assisting descriptive texts were made. Further, the order of the MADM items was changed to improve the understanding of decision-making.
Discussion
Primarily, the discussion concerns how decision-making can be understood in the context of maternity care and why women's understanding of decision-making in Danish maternity care in the MADM scale items was challenged.
Conclusion
The qualitative pilot test using cognitive interviews after translation of the instruments was a valuable method for cultural adaptation providing important knowledge on women's understanding and perceptions of item contents. The cognitive interviews provided a comprehensive understanding of decision-making and contributed to a thoroughly worked Danish version of the MADM and MORi instruments.}

abstract = {Objective
To demonstrate the impact of demographic data on the clinical outcomes of patients with emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) treated at our center, and to present the results obtained—particularly through the comparison of drainage methods—in the largest patient group possible.
Materials and methods
This retrospective single-center study included 54 EPN patients treated at a tertiary care hospital. Inclusion required symptoms of upper urinary tract infection and gas in the renal parenchyma, collecting system, or perinephric space on abdominal CT. Data on demographics, urinary tract stones, labs, imaging (Huang and Tseng classification), hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality were analyzed by initial treatment, drainage method, and platelet count. Patients with at least 6 months of follow-up were assessed for infection recurrence, renal function loss, and delayed nephrectomy.
Results
Advanced age was associated with increased ICU need and mortality (respectively p = 0.047, p = 0.039). Diabetes was associated with longer hospital stays compared to those without DM (14 vs. 7.5 days, p = 0.015). Thrombocytopenia was linked to higher rates of non-functioning kidneys (66.7%) and delayed nephrectomy (33.3%). No significant differences in morbidity or mortality were found between drainage methods (percutaneous vs. DJ stent). More male patients had advanced-stage disease, though this did not impact outcomes.
Conclusion
EPN is an emergency urological situation with high rate of mortality. Therefore, early diagnosis and appropriate management are crucial to decrease morbidity and mortality. Patient management approaches can be improved with growing evidence and prospective data with future studies.
Resumen
Objetivo
Evaluar el impacto de las características demográficas en los resultados clínicos de los pacientes con pielonefritis enfisematosa (PE) tratados en nuestro centro, y presentar los resultados obtenidos—especialmente mediante la comparación de los métodos de drenaje—en el mayor grupo de pacientes posible.
Material y métodos
Este estudio retrospectivo unicéntrico incluyó a 54 pacientes con PE tratados en un hospital de tercer nivel. Los criterios de inclusión fueron pacientes con síntomas de infección del tracto urinario superior y presencia de gas en el parénquima renal, el sistema colector o el espacio perinéfrico en la TC abdominal. Las características demográficas, la presencia de litiasis urinaria, los hallazgos de laboratorio y pruebas de imagen (clasificación de Huang y Tseng), la estancia hospitalaria y en la unidad de cuidados intensivos (UCI) y la mortalidad se analizaron según el tratamiento inicial, la técnica de drenaje y el recuento plaquetario. En los pacientes con al menos 6 meses de seguimiento se evaluó la infección recurrente, la pérdida de función renal y la nefrectomía diferida.
Resultados
La edad avanzada se asoció con mayor necesidad de ingreso en UCI y mortalidad (p = 0,047 y p = 0,039, respectivamente). La diabetes se asoció con estancias hospitalarias más prolongadas en comparación con los pacientes sin DM (14 frente a 7,5 días, p = 0,015). La trombocitopenia se relacionó con tasas más elevadas de riñones no funcionantes (66,7%) y de nefrectomía diferida (33,3%). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en cuanto a morbilidad o mortalidad entre los tipos de drenaje (percutáneo o catéter DJ). Un mayor número de varones presentó enfermedad en estadio avanzado, aunque esto no influyó en los resultados.
Conclusiones
La PE constituye una urgencia urológica con una elevada mortalidad. El diagnóstico temprano y un manejo adecuado resultan esenciales para disminuir tanto la morbilidad como la mortalidad. La incorporación de nueva evidencia y de datos prospectivos procedentes de futuros estudios permitirá optimizar el abordaje de estos pacientes.}

abstract = {Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for clinical decision support, but their real-world performance varies. We compared three leading models (OpenAI's “o1” Large Reasoning Model (LRM), Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Meta's Llama-3.2–70B) to human experts in an emergency internal medicine setting.
Methods
We conducted a prospective comparative study on 73 anonymized patient cases from the Emergency Internal Medicine ward of the University Hospital Split, Croatia (June–September 2024). Two independent internal medicine specialists, blinded to model identity, graded the LLM-generated reports in two steps: (1) they evaluated the relevance of recommended diagnostic tests based on the patient's signs, symptoms, and medical history; (2) after reviewing the actual diagnostic test results, they assessed each model's final diagnosis, therapy plan, and follow-up recommendations. The same evaluative framework was applied to human-authored reports. Likert scales (1–4 or 1–3) were used, and statistical comparisons included the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
Results
The o1 model achieved a mean final rating (3.63) statistically indistinguishable from human physicians (3.67; p = 0.62). Claude-3.5-Sonnet (3.38) and Llama-3.2–70B (3.23) scored significantly lower (p < 0.01 vs. o1), largely due to errors in therapy planning and non-medication recommendations. Despite this gap, all three models demonstrated ≥90 % accuracy in final diagnoses and patient admission decisions. The o1 model correctly classified all abnormal lab values (100 %), while Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Llama-3.2–70B showed minor errors (99.5 % and 99 % accuracy, respectively).
Conclusions
When evaluated on real-world emergency cases, an advanced LLM with enhanced reasoning (o1) can match expert-level clinical performance, underscoring its potential utility as a decision-support tool.}

Traditional machine learning approaches require significant expertise in data preprocessing and model development, which limits their accessibility. This study introduces an innovative large language model (LLM)-based technique to automate the implementation and optimization of machine learning algorithms for battery state-of-health (SOH) forecasting. The proposed framework integrates ChatGPT into the complete machine learning pipeline, including data pre-processing, determining importance of characteristics, model recommendation and selection based on learning from reference studies, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The LLM-driven approach involves iterative refinement of the model through structured prompts, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to the specific requirements of the SOH estimation. The study utilized a publicly available dataset of a lithium-ion battery used in the propulsion system of an eVTOL vehicle, which includes comprehensive flight missions and structured charge–discharge cycles. Three machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were implemented and optimized using ChatGPT. The performance of the LLM-driven models was benchmarked against conventional methods, demonstrating a 52% reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to traditional approaches. The findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven machine learning in enhancing battery health prediction, making advanced techniques more accessible to a broader audience. This study demonstrates that integrating ChatGPT into the machine learning workflow can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of SOH estimation for eVTOL applications.}

abstract = {Purpose
To identify the potential target genes of blast lung injury (BLI) for the diagnosis and treatment.
Methods
This is an experimental study. The BLI models in rats and goats were established by conducting a fuel-air explosive power test in an unobstructed environment, which was subsequently validated through hematoxylin-eosin staining. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on lung tissues from both goats and rats. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the criteria of q ≤ 0.05 and |log2 fold change| ≥ 1. Following that, enrichment analyses were conducted for gene ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The potential target genes were further confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
Results
Observations through microscopy unveiled the presence of reddish edema fluid, erythrocytes, and instances of focal or patchy bleeding within the alveolar cavity. Transcriptome sequencing analysis identified a total of 83 differentially expressed genes in both rats and goats. Notably, 49 genes exhibited a consistent expression pattern, with 38 genes displaying up-regulation and 11 genes demonstrating down-regulation. Enrichment analysis highlighted the potential involvement of the interleukin-17 signaling pathway and vascular smooth muscle contraction pathway in the underlying mechanism of BLI. Furthermore, the experimental findings in both goats and rats demonstrated a strong association between BLI and several key genes, including anterior gradient 2, ankyrin repeat domain 65, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family A member 1, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family B member 1, and keratin 4, which exhibited up-regulation.
Conclusions
Anterior gradient 2, ankyrin repeat domain 65, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family A member 1, bactericidal/permeability-increasing fold containing family B member 1, and keratin 4 hold potential as target genes for the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of BLI.}

abstract = {Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, overwhelming healthcare systems. Numerous clinical trials have explored the efficacy of Chinese herbal formulae (CHFs) in treating COVID-19, resulting in a surge of systematic reviews (SRs). This review critically evaluates the additive effectiveness of CHFs for COVID-19, aiming to provide a robust foundation for high-quality research and integrated therapeutic strategies.
Methods
This PRISMA-compliant review was registered on PROSPERO. We included SRs assessed oral CHFs combined with guideline recommended Standard Treatment (ST), versus ST in patients with COVID-19 patients. Primary outcomes included clinical improvement (e.g., days without ventilator support) and deterioration (e.g., new need for oxygen therapy). PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Sinomed, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP were searched from inception to July 1, 2024, for SRs (Cochrane/non-Cochrane) of RCTs reporting predefined outcomes. Secondary meta-analyses were conducted using RevMan 5.3, with methodological quality and evidence certainty assessed via AMSTAR-II and GRADE.
Results
Eight SRs (6860 cases) were included. Meta-analyses showed that CHF combined with ST outperformed ST alone in reducing all-cause mortality (RR = 0.27, 95 %CI [0.08–0.96], P = 0.04), adverse events (RR = 0.34, 95 %CI [0.20–0.59], P < 0.0001), severe case conversion (RR = 0.33, 95 %CI [0.17–0.66], P = 0.002), and improving pulmonary imaging (RR = 1.28, 95 %CI [1.12–1.46], P = 0.0003). No significant differences were observed in clinical symptom recovery rates (cough) or recovery times (cough and fatigue). Bubble plots suggested weak to moderate effects of specific CHFs (e.g., Buzhongyiqi Decoction, Maxingshigan-Weijing Decoction) on viral clearance, severe case conversion, adverse events, and pulmonary imaging.
Conclusion
Comprehensive analyses indicated that CHFs showed good add-on effect in treating COVID-19. However, it is important to note that the overall quality of evidence in these studies is generally low, and further high-quality clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.}

For efficient phosphate recovery, different organic ligands are calcined herein using the metal-organic framework (MOF) template sacrificial method to synthesize nano-magnesium oxides (MgOs) with varying morphologies, pore structures, and vacancie concentrations (oxygen vacancy and Mg vacancy). 2,5-Dihydroxyterephthalic acid (DHTA)-MgO, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (H3BTC)-MgO, and adipic acid (AA)-MgO primarily rely on chemical adsorption, supplemented by physical adsorption. AA-MgO exhibits an adsorption capacity of 323.9 mg P/L for phosphate at pH8, which is 3.89 and 1.09 times higher than those of DHTA-MgO and H3BTC-MgO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations (DFT) confirm that the main mechanisms involved in phosphate adsorption are ligand exchange, intraspherical complexation, and electrostatic attraction. Moreover, the main phosphate adsorption sites on AA-MgO are oxygen vacancy, Mg, and Mg vacancy. When the inorganic phosphorus concentration = 38.39 ± 0.2 mg P/L, AA-MgO dosage = 1.2 g/L, the removal rate of phosphate in livestock wastewater reaches 100 %. Thus, the proposed method can be beneficial for improving the quality of acidic water bodies. This study provides a new approach for phosphate removal from livestock wastewater.}

Without co-exposure, P. velutina completely decolorizes RB5 within 9 days. The highest inhibitory effect was found for soluble CdCl2 with an EC50 of 583 μg l−1, followed by MPA-QDs (10,628 μg l−1) and NAC-QDs (17,575 μg l−1). The different EC50 values indicate that the nanoparticle coatings have a strong influence on the inhibitory effects, as the organic ligands used for surface passivation prevented the leaching of acute toxic Cd ions from the metallic QD core. Compared to CdCl2, the CdTe QDs were less inhibitory to the formation of fungal metabolites and their decolorization ability on co-exposed textile dyes. In addition, the literature comparison suggests that P. velutina is more resilient to cadmium than other microorganisms. The fungus could therefore be used for bioremediation applications of dye- or QD-contaminated wastewater from the textile or semiconductor industries.}

abstract = {Objectives
The chemokine CCL22 is recognized for recruiting immunosuppressive regulatory T-cells (Treg) that contribute to disease progression in various tumor entities helping them to evade the host immune response. Our study aims to identify the expressing cell types and to evaluate the prognostic significance of CCL22 secretion and its association with Treg invasion in endometrial cancer (EC), an immunogenic cancer.
Methods
Specimens from 275 patients with EC and 28 healthy controls were screened immunohistochemically for CCL22. Immunofluorescence double-staining for CCL22 and different immune cell markers was performed. In vitro regulation of CCL22-expression was examined in EC cell lines (Ishikawa+, RL95–2) and human PBMCs in coculture settings via qPCR and ELISA.
Results
Elevated CCL22 staining in tumor cells and CCL22-positive M1-macrophages in tumordistant areas were significantly associated with increased overall survival (OS). Conversely, high, secretory-appearing staining in the peritumoral and intratumoral stroma correlated with reduced OS. Although the analysis of the in vitro coculture model of epithelial tumor- and immune cells revealed PBMCs as the primary source of CCL22, we could confirm expression of the chemokine also in the EC epithelial cells.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that CCL22 in EC is associated with OS, dependent on its location and the cell type producing it. Intracellular upregulation and extracellular secretion must be considered separately when investigating CCL22 expressing cell types in EC. These results may provide evidence for CCL22-mediated Treg recruitment in EC as a potential future therapeutic target.}

Such valuable organic materials produced from previously considered waste products are increasingly viewed as attractive nature-positive solutions to improve soil quality and fertility that could help in climate change mitigation and address sustainable development goals. In this study, compost and compost-derived biochar were produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and tested as soil amendments for the cultivation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L), irrigated with both tap water and secondary wastewater effluent. Physicochemical characterization of compost, biochar and soil showed that the investigated materials were not so rich, compared to biochars from different feedstocks but when applied to the soil for lettuce cultivation, they may provide a positive effect. The combined effect of the use of bio-based materials and irrigation with treated wastewater was found to lead to higher soil and crops quality. Longer crop growth cycles are necessary to clearly demonstrate the positive effect of biochar on crop yield. Such materials can effectively be used for sustainable agriculture, contributing to the promotion of nature-based solutions as useful tools that promote circular practices.}

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic was accompanied by a barrage of false, misleading, and manipulated information that inhibited effective pandemic response and led to thousands of preventable deaths. Recognition of the urgent public health threat posed by this infodemic led to the development of numerous infodemic management interventions by a wide range of actors. The need to respond rapidly and with limited information sometimes came at the expense of strategy and conceptual rigor. Given limited funding for public health communication and growing politicization of countermisinformation efforts, responses to future infodemics should be informed by a systematic and conceptually grounded evaluation of the successes and shortcomings of existing interventions to ensure credibility of the field and evidence-based action.
Objectives
This study sought to identify gaps and opportunities in existing infodemic management interventions and to assess the use of public health frameworks to structure responses to infodemics.
Methods
We expanded a previously developed dataset of infodemic management interventions, spanning guidelines, policies, and tools from governments, academic institutions, nonprofits, media companies, and other organizations, with 379 interventions included in total. We applied framework analysis to describe and interpret patterns within these interventions through their alignment with codes derived from 3 frameworks selected for their prominence in public health and infodemic-related scholarly discourse: the epidemiological model, the socioecological model, and the environmental health framework.
Results
The epidemiological model revealed the need for rigorous, transparent risk assessments to triage misinformation. The socioecological model demonstrated an opportunity for greater coordination across levels of influence, with only 11% of interventions receiving multiple socioecological codes, and more robust partnerships with existing organizations. The environmental health framework showed that sustained approaches that comprehensively address all influences on the information environment are needed, representing only 19% of the dataset.
Conclusions
Responses to future infodemics would benefit from cross-sector coordination, adoption of measurable and meaningful goals, and alignment with public health frameworks, which provide critical conceptual grounding for infodemic response approaches and ensure comprehensiveness of approach. Beyond individual interventions, a funded coordination mechanism can provide overarching strategic direction and promote collaboration.}

The present study aimed at comparing the behavior of adolescent male and female rats (post-natal day P30) tested in the Hole-Board paradigm, with a particular emphasis on the temporal organization and anxiety-related behaviors. Our analysis revealed a peculiar lack of significant findings in quantitative measures (e.g., mean occurrences and durations); on the contrary, highly significant sex-based differences concerning the temporal organization of behavior and the overall behavioral organization were observed. Our results suggest that adolescents female exhibited behaviors less constrained by the anxiety-related patterns observed in their male counterparts. These findings underscore the crucial role of adolescence in shaping key developmental dynamics, such as motivation, exploration, and anxiety regulation, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of how these processes evolve differently between the sexes during this critical period of development.}

abstract = {Introduction
With the advent of FLASH radiotherapy, alanine dosimetry has gained attention as a promising dosimeter owing to its dose-rate independence. However, before utilized in radiotherapy, procedures for determining the absorbed dose to water using alanine under clinical proton beams must be established. This study sought to develop a formula for alanine dosimetry by deriving beam quality correction factors and validating them through Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements.
Materials and Methods
To calculate the absorbed dose to water using alanine dosimeters, a formula was developed specifically for the plateau region. Alanine dosimeters were irradiated under both a reference beam (Cobalt-60) and clinical proton beams. Beam quality correction factors were calculated and subsequently validated through Monte Carlo simulations using the Tool for Particle Simulation (TOPAS), which is based on GEANT4, as well as through experimental measurements. During the simulations, both crystalline and bulk densities of alanine were considered.
Results
The simulation results showed that the average beam quality correction factors for alanine were 1.005 for crystalline density and 1.012 for bulk density. Experimental measurements under clinical proton beams yielded a beam quality correction factor of 1.014, with a standard uncertainty of 2.2%.
Conclusions
These results suggest that alanine dosimeters provide reliable and reproducible measurements for proton therapy. The robust methodology demonstrated here highlights the potential of alanine dosimeters in clinical applications, demonstrating their effectiveness and reliability in determining the absorbed dose to water under clinical proton beam conditions.}

However, single-stage networks often yield suboptimal results with blurred textures and structural distortion, while existing progressive strategies struggle to effectively balance local and global information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative adversarial model that progressively reconstructs mural details by adaptively integrating multi-scale local features and global context based on damage severity. We first obtain initial coarse results using an encoder-decoder network. Then, a mask-guided network adaptively extracts and fuses local features according to damage levels. Next, multi-level residual learning further refines details at different scales. Finally, a global network captures overall artistic characteristics using an optimized Transformer-UNet architecture. In this way, our method harmonizes detailed local restoration with the preservation of overall artistic integrity throughout the progressive inpainting process. Extensive experiments on multiple mural datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of texture clarity and structural coherence.

abstract = {Background
Communication among health care professionals is essential for the delivery of safe clinical care. Secure messaging has rapidly emerged as a new mode of asynchronous communication. Despite its popularity, relatively little is known about how secure messaging is used and how such use contributes to communication burden.
Objective
This study aims to characterize the use of an electronic health record–integrated secure messaging platform across 14 hospitals and 263 outpatient clinics within a large health care system.
Methods
We collected metadata on the use of the Epic Systems Secure Chat platform for 6 months (July 2022 to January 2023). Information was retrieved on message volume, response times, message characteristics, messages sent and received by users, user roles, and work settings (inpatient vs outpatient).
Results
A total of 32,881 users sent 9,639,149 messages during the study. Median daily message volume was 53,951 during the first 2 weeks of the study and 69,526 during the last 2 weeks, resulting in an overall increase of 29% (P=.03). Nurses were the most frequent users of secure messaging (3,884,270/9,639,149, 40% messages), followed by physicians (2,387,634/9,639,149, 25% messages), and medical assistants (1,135,577/9,639,149, 12% messages). Daily message frequency varied across users; inpatient advanced practice providers and social workers interacted with the highest number of messages per day (median 19). Conversations were predominantly between 2 users (1,258,036/1,547,879, 81% conversations), with a median of 2 conversational turns and a median response time of 2.4 minutes. The largest proportion of inpatient messages was from nurses to physicians (972,243/4,749,186, 20% messages) and physicians to nurses (606,576/4,749,186, 13% messages), while the largest proportion of outpatient messages was from physicians to nurses (344,048/2,192,488, 16% messages) and medical assistants to other medical assistants (236,694/2,192,488, 11% messages).
Conclusions
Secure messaging was widely used by a diverse range of health care professionals, with ongoing growth throughout the study and many users interacting with more than 20 messages per day. The short message response times and high messaging volume observed highlight the interruptive nature of secure messaging, raising questions about its potentially harmful effects on clinician workflow, cognition, and errors.}

abstract = {Background
Although prior work demonstrated the surprising accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) on neurosurgery board-style questions, their use in day-to-day clinical situations warrants further investigation. This study assessed GPT-4.0′s responses to common clinical questions across various subspecialties of neurosurgery.
Methods
A panel of attending neurosurgeons formulated 35 general neurosurgical questions spanning neuro-oncology, spine, vascular, functional, pediatrics, and trauma. All questions were input into GPT-4.0 with a prespecified, standard prompt. Responses were evaluated by two attending neurosurgeons, each on a standardized scale for accuracy, safety, and helpfulness. Citations were indexed and evaluated against identifiable database references.
Results
GPT-4.0 responses were consistent with current medical guidelines and accounted for recent advances in the field 92.8 % and 78.6 % of the time respectively. Neurosurgeons reported GPT-4.0 responses providing unrealistic information or potentially risky information 14.3 % and 7.1 % of the time respectively. Assessed on 5-point scales, responses suggested that GPT-4.0 was clinically useful (4.0 ± 0.6), relevant (4.7 ± 0.3), and coherent (4.9 ± 0.2). The depth of clinical responses varied (3.7 ± 0.6), and “red flag” symptoms were missed 7.1 % of the time. Moreover, GPT-4.0 cited 86 references (2.46 citations per answer), of which only 50 % were deemed valid, and 77.1 % of responses contained at least one inappropriate citation.
Conclusion
Current general LLM technology can offer generally accurate, safe, and helpful neurosurgical information, but may not fully evaluate medical literature or recent field advances. Citation generation and usage remains unreliable. As this technology becomes more ubiquitous, clinicians will need to exercise caution when dealing with it in practice.}

abstract = {Synthetic polymers are often utilized in the creation of vascular devices, and need to possess specific qualities to prevent thrombosis. Traditional strategies for this include surface modification of vascular devices through covalent attachment of substrates such as heparin, antiplatelet agents, thrombolytic agents, or hydrophilic polymers. One promising prosthetic material is polyether ether ketone (PEEK), which is utilized in various FDA-approved medical devices, including vascular and endovascular prostheses. We hypothesized that surface modification of biologically inert PEEK can help improve its endothelial cell affinity and reduce its thrombogenic potential. To evaluate this, we developed an effective surface-modification approach with unique cyclic peptides, such as CCHGGVRLYC and CCREDVC. We treated the PEEK surface with ammonia plasma, which introduced amine groups onto the PEEK surface. Subsequently, we were able to conjugate these peptides to the plasma-modified PEEKs. We observed that cyclic CCHGGVRLYC conjugated on prosthetic PEEK not only supported endothelialization, but minimized platelet adhesion and activation. This technology can be potentially applied for in vivo vascular and endovascular protheses to enhance their utility and patency.}

abstract = {Introduction
Fatigue is common and burdensome in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), yet pharmacological treatments offer limited relief. Exercise is gaining attention as a non-pharmacological strategy, and resistance training is increasingly recommended. However, Tai Chi—a traditional Chinese exercise—has not yet been evaluated in this population. This study compared the effects of Tai Chi and resistance training on multiple outcomes in patients with UC.
Methods
This single-center, evaluator-blind, three-arm randomized clinical trial block-randomized 75 patients with UC to 12 weeks of Tai Chi or resistance training and a control group involving standard treatment and care with general exercise advice. Eligible participants had fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score ≥ 40) and were in remission or had mild-to-moderate disease activity (Modified Mayo score ≤ 10). The primary outcome was fatigue, secondary outcomes included handgrip strength (HGS), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), sleep quality, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life, all strongly associated with fatigue.
Results
The three groups showed significant differences in total fatigue and in general, physical, and mental fatigue subdimensions. Compared with the control group, fatigue improved in both the Tai Chi group (mean difference:8.90 [95 % confidence interval [CI], -15.11 to -2.69]) and the resistance training group (mean difference:7.00 [95 % CI, -13.16 to -0.84]), with no significant differences between them. However, between the two interventions, Tai Chi showed numerically greater improvements in anxiety, depression, and emotional function, while resistance training led to greater improvements in HGS (mean difference: 7.50 [95 % CI, 2.37 to 12.63]) and SMI (mean difference: 0.54 [95 % CI, 0.01 to 1.08]). No adverse events occurred, except for one case of mild abdominal discomfort in the resistance training group, which resolved with rest.
Conclusions
Both Tai Chi and resistance training effectively reduced fatigue and improved related outcomes in UC patients. Tai Chi may be more beneficial for psychological symptoms, while resistance training showed greater improvements in physical strength. Given their complementary advantages and safety, both may serve as valuable non-pharmacological options in UC management. Future studies should explore their integration into long-term, multimodal treatment strategies.

Exposure to air pollutants is a major factor in both the development and exacerbation of asthma symptoms. This study reviewed the impact of key air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) or ≤10μm (PM10), and ozone (O3), on asthma outcomes. Our analysis of 20 studies showed significant associations between exposure to these pollutants and increased asthma incidence and prevalence, particularly in children. Specifically, pollutants such as elemental carbon (EC), benzene, NO2, PM10, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were found to be significantly associated with asthma development in children, while NO2 and PM2.5 were linked to asthma exacerbations in both children and adults. Additionally, hospitalizations and emergency room visits were positively correlated with exposure to PM2.5 and O3 in both children and adults, and the elderly showed significant associations with O3 exposure. Although asthma-related mortality was not directly linked to specific pollutants, a few studies indicated a broader association between exposure to pollutants like NO2 and PM2.5 and increased overall mortality. These findings highlight the importance of reducing exposure to outdoor air pollutants to mitigate asthma risk and improve public health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.
Resumen
El asma es una enfermedad pulmonar crónica que afecta a personas de todas las edades, contribuyendo a una morbimortalidad significativa. La exposición a contaminantes atmosféricos es un factor clave tanto en el desarrollo como en la exacerbación de los síntomas del asma. Este estudio revisa el impacto de los principales contaminantes del aire, incluyendo dióxido de nitrógeno (NO2), material particulado con un diámetro ≤2,5μm (PM2,5) o ≤10μm (PM10), y ozono (O3), sobre los resultados del asma. Nuestro análisis de 20 estudios muestra asociaciones significativas entre la exposición a estos contaminantes y un aumento en la incidencia y prevalencia del asma, especialmente en niños. En particular, contaminantes como el carbono elemental (EC), el benceno, el NO2, el PM10 y el dióxido de azufre (SO2) se asociaron significativamente con el desarrollo del asma en niños, mientras que el NO2 y el PM2,5 se vinculaban con exacerbaciones del asma tanto en niños como en adultos. Además, se encontraron correlaciones positivas entre las hospitalizaciones y las visitas a urgencias con la exposición a PM2,5 y O3 en niños y adultos, y los ancianos mostraron asociaciones significativas con la exposición a O3. Aunque la mortalidad relacionada con el asma no se vinculó directamente a contaminantes específicos, algunos estudios indicaron una asociación más amplia entre la exposición a contaminantes como NO2 y PM2,5 y un aumento en la mortalidad general. Estos hallazgos resaltan la importancia de reducir la exposición a contaminantes atmosféricos exteriores para mitigar el riesgo de asma y mejorar los resultados en salud pública, especialmente en poblaciones vulnerables como niños y ancianos.}

Higher education faces daily challenges: deep and specialized knowledge is available from everywhere and accessible to almost everyone. University lecturers of specialized master courses confront the problem that their lectures are either too boring or too complex for the attending students. Additionally, curricula are changing more rapidly than they have in the past 10–30 years. The German education system comprises different educational forms, with universities providing less practical content. Consequently, many university students do not obtain the practical skills they should ideally gain through university lectures. Therefore, in this work, a new lecture concept is proposed based on the extension of the just-in-time teaching paradigm: Personalized and Demand-Based Education. This concept includes: 1) an initial assessment of students’ backgrounds, 2) selecting the appropriate educational blocks, and 3) collecting ongoing feedback during the semester. The feedback was gathered via Pingo, ensuring anonymity for the students. Our concept was exemplarily tested in the new lecture ”Practical Tools for Control Engineers” at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The initial results indicate that our proposed concept could be beneficial in addressing the current challenges in higher education.}

Introduction
There is currently no clear consensus on the standards for using large language models such as ChatGPT in academic medicine. Hence, we performed a scoping review of available literature to understand the current state of LLM use in medicine and to provide a guideline for future utilization in academia.
Materials and methods
A scoping review of the literature was performed through a Medline search on February 16, 2023 using a combination of keywords including artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, generative pre-trained transformer, ChatGPT, and large language model. There were no restrictions to language or date of publication. Records not pertaining to LLMs were excluded. Records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT were identified and evaluated separately. Among the records pertaining to LLM ChatBots and ChatGPT, those that suggest recommendations for ChatGPT use in academia were utilized to create guideline statements for ChatGPT and LLM use in academic medicine.
Results
A total of 87 records were identified. 30 records were not pertaining to large language models and were excluded. 54 records underwent a full-text review for evaluation. There were 33 records related to LLM ChatBots or ChatGPT.
Discussion
From assessing these texts, five guideline statements for LLM use was developed: (1) ChatGPT/LLM cannot be cited as an author in scientific manuscripts; (2) If use of ChatGPT/LLM are considered for use in academic work, author(s) should have at least a basic understanding of what ChatGPT/LLM is; (3) Do not use ChatGPT/LLM to produce entirety of text in manuscripts; humans must be held accountable for use of ChatGPT/LLM and contents created by ChatGPT/LLM should be meticulously verified by humans; (4) ChatGPT/LLMs may be used for editing and refining of text; (5) Any use of ChatGPT/LLM should be transparent and should be clearly outlined in scientific manuscripts and acknowledged.
Conclusion
Future authors should remain mindful of the potential impact their academic work may have on healthcare and continue to uphold the highest ethical standards and integrity when utilizing ChatGPT/LLM.}

abstract = {Objectives
To gather the perspectives of APS ACTION members regarding the strengths and limitations of Damage Index for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (DIAPS); and establish recommendations for the improvement of DIAPS.
Methods
APS ACTION members were invited to answer a survey regarding their satisfaction with DIAPS scoring system and individual items. The level of agreement (LoA) among members with the inclusion of individual items in DIAPS was calculated (LoA of <75% was considered disagreement). Respondents’ open-ended comments about DIAPS limitations were also collected, which helped formulate our recommendations for DIAPS improvement.
Results
Forty-two APS ACTION members (58.3%) answered the survey. Of them, 26 (61.9%) were satisfied, 4 (9.5%) were neutral, and 12 (28.6%) were dissatisfied with the current DIAPS scoring system. Fifteen items (39.5%) presented a LoA <75% regarding the inclusion in DIAPS. Respondents provided comments that were grouped under six main categories related to concerns about: a) definitions and attribution of damage (including causality and temporal relationship); b) scoring system; c) overlapping items; d) specific items (exclusion of redundant items and inclusion of additional ones); e) the need to incorporate multiple events; and f) feasibility and practicality. Finally, the APS ACTION “Damage” Working Group developed 7 recommendations that should be considered for the next generation DIAPS.
Conclusion
Approximately 60% of respondents were satisfied with DIAPS and its definitions; however, our survey demonstrated that there is substantial room to improve the current damage index for APS. Efforts for updating DIAPS should consider the APS ACTION “Damage” Working Group recommendations.}

In this study, we assessed the composition and diversity of macrobenthic communities at ten different sites in the Jianjiang River estuary reserve in both Spring and Autumn and used three biotic indices to evaluate the ecological quality status (EcoQs) across the reserve. We identified 58 macrobenthic taxa, of which the largest proportion were Mollusca (48.28 %), followed by Annelida (27.59 %) and Arthropoda (18.97 %). Macrobenthic abundance and biomass varied among sites and seasons, and community composition was driven by different environmental variables in Spring and Autumn. With respect to our three indices of ecological quality, abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) curve analysis and the associated W-statistics indicated that macrobenthic communities in the reserve were undisturbed in the Spring but disturbed in Autumn. The AZTI marine biotic index (AMBI) indicated that most sites have high or good EcoQs, with higher EcoQs in the Spring, and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) index similarly suggested that the average EcoQs were good in Spring but only moderate in Autumn. We suspect that the consistently lower EcoQs in Autumn across all sites were largely due to a 1-in-10-year flood discharge that occurred during our sampling year and disturbed sites near the river outflow. Overall, our results point towards specific, scientifically informed suggestions for future management of the Jianjiang River estuary reserve.}

abstract = {Virtual fencing presents a promising solution for grazing management, providing flexibility, individual monitoring, potential improvements in land management, and enhanced animal welfare. However, welfare issues related to electric stimuli and species-specific learning abilities need consideration. This study aimed to investigate if sheep could learn and be fenced by a fully automated virtual fencing system. Eight Norwegian White ewes with twin lambs, all naïve to virtual fencing, were randomly selected at the beginning of September 2018. Fitted with Nofence virtual fence collars designed for goats, the ewes were subjected to daily behavioural observations over nine days. The Nofence technology is a fully automated system that uses GPS coordinates, that trigger an audio cue when an animal crosses the boundary. If the animal does not turn, it receives an electric stimulus. The study was divided into three periods: an adaptation period (2 days), period 1 (5 days), where the first virtual boundary was introduced on day 1, and period 2 (4 days) when a second boundary was introduced. Additionally, the ewes wore heart rate monitors for at least one hour daily. Throughout the study, the ewes received a total of 218 audio cues and 38 electric stimuli, indicating an approximate individual mean of 27 audio cues and 5 electric stimuli received The number of audio cues and electric stimuli significantly decreased over days in both experimental periods. In period 2, the number of audio cues was significantly higher compared to period 1, while the success ratio in avoiding electric stimuli remained stable across days. The experimental period significantly influenced the frequency of standing/walking behaviour, being more common in the adaptation period compared to periods 1 and 2. However, the period did not have a significant effect on the percentages of lying or grazing behaviour. During heart rate monitoring, four ewes received one electric stimulus each, resulting in an immediate heart rate increase that returned to baseline within minutes. The present study demonstrates that sheep wearing a fully automated system quickly learned to associate audio cues with electric stimuli. The ability to generalise experiences from one virtual boundary to another emphasises their learning ability. Minor changes in activity were likely influenced by factors other than the virtual fencing system. The short-lasting increase in heart rate as a response to electric stimuli suggests a temporary stress reaction. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential of virtual fencing for sheep management.}

abstract = {Background
Medical abstract sentence classification is crucial for enhancing medical database searches, literature reviews, and generating new abstracts. However, Chinese medical abstract classification research is hindered by a lack of suitable datasets. Given the vastness of Chinese medical literature and the unique value of traditional Chinese medicine, precise classification of these abstracts is vital for advancing global medical research.
Objective
This study aims to address the data scarcity issue by generating a large volume of labeled Chinese abstract sentences without manual annotation, thereby creating new training datasets. Additionally, we seek to develop more accurate text classification algorithms to improve the precision of Chinese medical abstract classification.
Methods
We developed 3 training datasets (dataset #1, dataset #2, and dataset #3) and a test dataset to evaluate our model. Dataset #1 contains 15,000 abstract sentences translated from the PubMed dataset into Chinese. Datasets #2 and #3, each with 15,000 sentences, were generated using GPT-3.5 from 40,000 Chinese medical abstracts in the CSL database. Dataset #2 used titles and keywords for pseudolabeling, while dataset #3 aligned abstracts with category labels. The test dataset includes 87,000 sentences from 20,000 abstracts. We used SBERT embeddings for deeper semantic analysis and evaluated our model using clustering (SBERT-DocSCAN) and supervised methods (SBERT-MEC). Extensive ablation studies and feature analyses were conducted to validate the model’s effectiveness and robustness.
Results
Our experiments involved training both clustering and supervised models on the 3 datasets, followed by comprehensive evaluation using the test dataset. The outcomes demonstrated that our models outperformed the baseline metrics. Specifically, when trained on dataset #1, the SBERT-DocSCAN model registered an impressive accuracy and F1-score of 89.85% on the test dataset. Concurrently, the SBERT-MEC algorithm exhibited comparable performance with an accuracy of 89.38% and an identical F1-score. Training on dataset #2 yielded similarly positive results for the SBERT-DocSCAN model, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of 89.83%, while the SBERT-MEC algorithm recorded an accuracy of 86.73% and an F1-score of 86.51%. Notably, training with dataset #3 allowed the SBERT-DocSCAN model to attain the best with an accuracy and F1-score of 91.30%, whereas the SBERT-MEC algorithm also showed robust performance, obtaining an accuracy of 90.39% and an F1-score of 90.35%. Ablation analysis highlighted the critical role of integrated features and methodologies in improving classification efficiency.
Conclusions
Our approach addresses the challenge of limited datasets for Chinese medical abstract classification by generating novel datasets. The deployment of SBERT-DocSCAN and SBERT-MEC models significantly enhances the precision of classifying Chinese medical abstracts, even when using synthetic datasets with pseudolabels.}

abstract = {In recent years, deep learning has seen widespread application in many fields. However, the emergence of adversarial examples has revealed a critical vulnerability, making them susceptible to potential attacks. Although numerous adversarial attack methods have been proposed, they are often constrained by certain constraints. Most current adversarial attack methods are based on addition of perturbations, which are confined to clean examples and fail to generate diverse and natural adversarial examples. Moreover, owing to the additional perturbations, these methods exhibit limited robustness against adversarial defenses, such as image denoising. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposed a three-stage attack framework based on an adversarial diffusion model, named AT-Diff (Adversarial Transfer on Diffusion model). Firstly, to address the issue of inadequate robustness in traditional adversarial examples, we utilize a diffusion model to learn the adversarial example distribution of the target model and generate highly realistic adversarial examples from scratch without any additional perturbations, thereby significantly enhancing their performance under defense measures. Additionally, we design a Temporal Adaptive Loss (TAL) function, which dynamically adjusts the visual loss and the adversarial loss according to the current time step, ensuring that the generated adversarial examples gradually enhance their adversarial efficacy while maintaining high visual quality. Extensive experiments conducted on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have shown that our method attains noteworthy results in imperceptibility, while also exhibiting stronger robustness.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and airplane or satellite imagery are widely used technologies for data acquisition in precision agriculture, each with advantages and disadvantages. UAVs capture high-resolution images but have a limited collection range, leading to higher costs per acre. In contrast, airplane imagery is more cost-effective and covers larger areas but typically provides lower spatial resolution (15–50 cm), which is inadequate for assessing specialty crops. For example, Agroview, an AI-driven platform for plant inventories and plant-level analytics, requires high-resolution imagery (<10 cm/pixel) for optimal performance. This study aims to address this limitation by developing an agriculture intelligence generative adversarial network (AgI-GANs) to enhance airplane imagery (∼15 cm/pixel resolution) to resolutions comparable to UAV imagery (∼3.9 cm/pixel). The AgI-GAN-enhanced images significantly improved Agroview’s tree detection accuracy, reducing detection errors to below 10 %, with an average error of 4.11 % ± 4.5 across 10 citrus orchards, compared to 36.21 % ± 9 when using unenhanced airplane images. Additionally, cost analysis demonstrates that AgI-GAN-enhanced airplane imagery reduces data acquisition costs to approximately $2.44 per acre, a 60 % reduction from the $6.07 per acre cost associated with UAV data collection. This study highlights the transformative potential of AgI-GAN in precision agriculture, providing a cost-effective solution that combines the extensive coverage of airplane imagery with the high resolution required for precise data analytics, benefiting specialty crop growers and agricultural stakeholders.}

abstract = {Background
Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a critical competency in critical care training, yet standardized methods for assessing MV-related knowledge are lacking. Traditional multiple-choice question (MCQ) development is resource-intensive, and prior studies have suggested that generative AI tools could streamline question creation. However, the quality of AI-generated MCQs remains unclear.
Research Question
Are MCQs generated by ChatGPT non-inferior to human-expert (HE) created questions in terms of quality and relevance for MV education.
Study Design and Methods
Three key MV topics were selected: Equation of Motion & Ohm’s Law, Tau & Auto PEEP, and Oxygenation. Fifteen learning objectives were used to generate 15 AI-written MCQs via a standardized prompt with ChatGPT (model o1-preview-2024-09-12). A group of 31 faculty experts, all of whom regularly teach MV, evaluated both AI-generated and HE-generated MCQs. Each MCQ was assessed based on its alignment with learning objectives, accuracy of chosen answer, clarity of stem, plausibility of distractors, and difficulty level. The faculty members were blinded to the provenance of the MCQ questions. The non-inferiority margin was predefined as 15% of the total possible score (-3.45).
Results
AI-generated MCQs were statistically non-inferior to expert-written MCQs (95% upper CI: [-1.15, ∞]). Additionally, respondents were unable to reliably differentiate AI-generated from HE-written MCQs (p = 0.32).
Interpretation
AI-generated MCQs using ChatGPT o1 are comparable in quality to those written by human experts. Given the time and resource-intensive nature of human MCQ development, AI-assisted question generation may serve as an efficient and scalable alternative for medical education assessment, even in highly specialized domains such as mechanical ventilation.

The increasing demand for task-oriented chatbots has triggered the proposal of many tools for their construction, like Dialogflow, Lex, Rasa, or Watson. However, selecting the most appropriate one is difficult; the conceptual design behind a chatbot may become buried under the tool technicalities; and migration between chatbot development platforms must be done manually. To alleviate these problems, we propose a platform-independent design notation for task-oriented chatbots, based on the analysis of fifteen chatbot development platforms. Following model-driven engineering principles, the chatbot implementation is synthesised from the design, and designs can be extracted from the implementations, enabling the migration and re-engineering of chatbots. Moreover, a recommender suggests the most suitable platform for a given chatbot design, considering contextual factors. We have realised these ideas in Conga: an extensible web application featuring a design notation editor; a development platform recommender; platform-specific validators; and generators and parsers for Dialogflow and Rasa. We evaluated Conga over 291 Dialogflow and Rasa open-source chatbots, showing its expressiveness, portability, and usefulness for finding chatbot quality issues (found in 93,8% of the chatbots). Overall, our architecture enables neutral chatbot designs, automates migration, and provides mechanisms for defect detection at the design level.}

This study presents a novel colorimetric sensor for glyphosate based on inhibiting Fe/ZnO nanozyme activity. By doping with iron and modulating the growth process of Fe/Zn MOFs precursors with triethylamine (TEA), Fe/ZnO nanozymes with substantial active surfaces and abundant Fe active sites were derived. The Fe/ZnO possessed excellent peroxidase-like activities, measuring 15.3 and 7.5 times higher than those of the materials synthesized without iron doping (ZnO) and the use of TEA (Fe/ZnO-w), respectively. Glyphosate inhibited the enzyme-like activity of Fe/ZnO by adsorbing on its surface through electrostatic interaction and occupying its catalytic active site. Based on this mechanism, a colorimetric sensing assay was created to directly and selectively detect glyphosate. The linear range for glyphosate detection was 0.02 to 10 mg L−1, with a detection limit (3σ) of 15.6 μg L−1. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of real samples. Metal oxides derived from well-designed MOFs provide a simple and effective strategy for creating high-performing pesticide detection platforms.}

Synthetic biology revolutionizes our ability to decode and recode genetic systems. The capability to reconstruct and flexibly manipulate multi-gene systems is critical for understanding cellular behaviors and has significant applications in therapeutics.
Objectives
This study aims to construct a diverse library of synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) to enable flexible control of multi-gene expression in mammalian cells.
Methods
We designed and constructed synthetic tunable promoters (STPs) that incorporate both a universal activation site (UAS) and a specific activation site (SAS), enabling multi-level expression control via the CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system. To evaluate promoter activity, we utilized Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) to assess the basal strengths of the STPs and their activation responses. Next, we constructed a three-gene reporter system to assess the capacity of the synthetic promoters for achieving multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems.
Results
The promoter library contains 24,960 unique non-redundant promoters with distinct sequence characteristics. MPRA revealed a wide range of promoter activities, showing different basal strengths and distinct activation levels when activated by the CRISPRa system. When regulated by targeting the SAS, the STPs exhibited orthogonality, allowing multilevel control of single-gene expression within multi-gene systems without cross-interference. Furthermore, the combinatorial activation of STPs in a multi-gene system enlarged the scope of expression levels achievable, providing fine-tuned control over gene expression.
Conclusion
We provide a diverse collection of synthetic tunable promoters, offering a valuable toolkit for the construction and manipulation of multi-gene systems in mammalian cells, with applications in gene therapy and biotechnology.}

abstract = {Conventional cognitive assessment is widely used in clinical and research settings, in educational institutions, and in the corporate world for personnel selection. Such approaches involve having a client, a patient, or a research participant complete a series of standardized cognitive tasks in order to challenge specific and global cognitive abilities, and then quantify performance for the desired end purpose. The latter may include a diagnostic confirmation of a disease, description of a state or ability, or matching cognitive characteristics to a particular occupational role requirement. Metrics derived from cognitive assessments are putatively informative about important features of the brain and its function. For this reason, the research sector also makes use of cognitive assessments, most frequently as a stimulus for cognitive activity from which to extract functional neuroimaging data. Such “task-related activations” form the core of the most widely used neuroimaging technologies, such as fMRI. Much of what we know about the brain has been drawn from the interleaving of cognitive assessments of various types with functional brain imaging technologies. Despite innovation in neuroimaging (i.e., quantifying the neural response), relatively little innovation has occurred on task presentation and volitional response measurement; yet these together comprise the core of cognitive performance. Moreover, even when cognitive assessment is interleaved with functional neuroimaging, this is most often undertaken in the research domain, rather than the primary applications of cognitive assessment in diagnosis and monitoring, education and personnel selection. There are new ways in which brain imaging—and even more importantly, brain modulation—technologies can be combined with automation and artificial intelligence to deliver next-generation cognitive assessment methods. In this review paper, we describe some prototypes for how this can be done and identify important areas for progress (technological and otherwise) to enable it to happen. We will argue that the future of cognitive assessment will include semi- and fully-automated assessments involving neuroimaging, standardized perturbations via neuromodulation technologies, and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the fact that cognitive assessments take place in a social/interpersonal context—normally between the patient and clinician—makes the human-machine interface consequential, and this will also be discussed.}

abstract = {Background
The use of natural language processing (NLP) in mental health research is increasing, with a wide range of applications and datasets being investigated.
Objective
This review aims to summarize the use of NLP in mental health research, with a special focus on the types of text datasets and the use of social determinants of health (SDOH) in NLP projects related to mental health.
Methods
The search was conducted in September 2024 using a broad search strategy in PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL Complete. All citations were uploaded to Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation) software. The screening and extraction process took place in Covidence with the help of a custom large language model (LLM) module developed by our team. This LLM module was calibrated and tuned to automate many aspects of the review process.
Results
The screening process, assisted by the custom LLM, led to the inclusion of 1768 studies in the final review. Most of the reviewed studies (n=665, 42.8%) used clinical data as their primary text dataset, followed by social media datasets (n=523, 33.7%). The United States contributed the highest number of studies (n=568, 36.6%), with depression (n=438, 28.2%) and suicide (n=240, 15.5%) being the most frequently investigated mental health issues. Traditional demographic variables, such as age (n=877, 56.5%) and gender (n=760, 49%), were commonly extracted, while SDOH factors were less frequently reported, with urban or rural status being the most used (n=19, 1.2%). Over half of the citations (n=826, 53.2%) did not provide clear information on dataset accessibility, although a sizable number of studies (n=304, 19.6%) made their datasets publicly available.
Conclusions
This scoping review underscores the significant role of clinical notes and social media in NLP-based mental health research. Despite the clear relevance of SDOH to mental health, their underutilization presents a gap in current research. This review can be a starting point for researchers looking for an overview of mental health projects using text data. Shared datasets could be used to place more emphasis on SDOH in future studies.}

Based on literature review and expert interviews/workshops, we develop a model, inspired by existing maturity models, that comprises five levels: explorer, beginner, advanced, expert and pioneer. By specifically assessing these dimensions, companies can identify their strengths and weaknesses, set strategic priorities and implement targeted measures to improve their sustainability and digitalization practices. A widespread adaptation of the framework could promote the competitiveness and resilience of companies in the age of digital transformation and contributes to the transition into a sustainable economy.

With the widespread promotion of generative AI, social recognition of ChatGPT's potential value increased. This study verifies the moderation effect of social attention in strengthening ChatGPT's impact, demonstrating that a higher search index for ChatGPT enhances stock returns for GPT-focused companies. Heterogeneity tests reveal that the impact of ChatGPT is significantly positive for large or non-state-owned companies, while small or state-owned companies show no significant effect.

abstract = {Objectives
Maladaptive risky decision-making is a common pathological behavior among patients with various psychiatric disorders. Brain entropy, which measures the complexity of brain time series signals, provides a novel approach to assessing brain health. Despite its potential, the dynamics of brain entropy have seldom been explored. This study aimed to construct a dynamic model of brain entropy and examine its predictive value for risky decision-making in patients with mental disorders, utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).
Methods
This study analyzed the rs-fMRI data from a total of 198 subjects, including 48 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), 47 patients with schizophrenia (SZ), 40 patients with adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as well as 63 healthy controls (HC). Time series signals were extracted from 264 brain regions based on rs-fMRI. The traditional static entropy and dynamic entropy (coefficient of variation, CV; rate of change, Rate) were constructed, respectively. Support vector regression was employed to predict risky decision-making utilizing leave-one-out cross-validation within each group.
Results
Our findings showed that CV achieved the best performances in HC and BD groups (r = −0.58, MAE = 6.43, R2 = 0.32; r = −0.78, MAE = 12.10, R2 = 0.61), while the Rate achieved the best in SZ and ADHD groups (r = −0.69, MAE = 10.20, R2 = 0.47; r = −0.78, MAE = 7.63, R2 = 0.60). For the dynamic entropy, the feature selection threshold rather than the time window length and overlapping ratio influenced predictive performance.
Conclusions
These results suggest that dynamic brain entropy could be a more effective predictor of risky decision-making than traditional static brain entropy. Our findings offer a novel perspective on exploring brain signal complexity and can serve as a reference for interventions targeting risky decision-making behaviors, particularly in individuals with psychiatric diagnoses.}

However, the factors that lead athletes to start using illegal substances are less known. The gateway to doping hypothesis posits that widespread dietary supplement usage among athletes could potentially desensitise them, increasing the inclination towards doping use. To examine this hypothesis, the personality structure of athletes using dietary supplements for diverse motives is examined, aiming to identify patterns indicative of doping propensity, including dark traits, perfectionism, ego and task orientation and attitude towards doping. The final sample comprises 687 athletes (479 women; mean age = 26.06 ± 9.21 years). The findings suggest that the overall use and frequency of dietary supplement intake are not significantly predicted by personality traits indicative of a predisposition towards doping. While athletes that use supplements to enhance performance, regeneration, and body shape display a slightly more favourable attitude towards doping, dark traits exhibit an inverse link across all motives (except body shape enhancement) with substantial effect sizes. Although doping usage is not assessed in this study, the outcomes indicate that personality structures associated with doping do not predict dietary supplement use, thus challenging the gateway to doping hypothesis.}

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to compare the quality and readability of the responses generated by 3 publicly available artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in answering frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (OMR) to assess their suitability for patient education.
Study Design
Fifteen OMR-related questions were selected from professional patient information websites. These questions were posed to ChatGPT-3.5 by OpenAI, Gemini 1.5 Pro by Google, and Copilot by Microsoft to generate responses. Three board-certified OMR specialists evaluated the responses regarding scientific adequacy, ease of understanding, and overall reader satisfaction. Readability was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) scores. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to compare the scores assigned by the evaluators to the responses from the chatbots and professional websites. Interevaluator agreement was examined by calculating the Fleiss kappa coefficient.
Results
There were no significant differences between groups in terms of scientific adequacy. In terms of readability, chatbots had overall mean FKGL and FRE scores of 12.97 and 34.11, respectively. Interevaluator agreement level was generally high.
Conclusions
Although chatbots are relatively good at responding to FAQs, validating AI-generated information using input from healthcare professionals can enhance patient care and safety. Readability of the text content in the chatbots and websites requires high reading levels.}

abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the performance of four large language models (LLMs)—GPT-4, PaLM 2, Qwen, and Baichuan 2—in generating responses to inquiries from Chinese patients about dry eye disease (DED).
Design
Two-phase study, including a cross-sectional test in the first phase and a real-world clinical assessment in the second phase.
Subjects
Eight board-certified ophthalmologists and 46 patients with DED.
Methods
The chatbots' responses to Chinese patients' inquiries about DED were assessed by the evaluation. In the first phase, six senior ophthalmologists subjectively rated the chatbots’ responses using a 5-point Likert scale across five domains: correctness, completeness, readability, helpfulness, and safety. Objective readability analysis was performed using a Chinese readability analysis platform. In the second phase, 46 representative patients with DED asked the two language models (GPT-4 and Baichuan 2) that performed best in the in the first phase questions and then rated the answers for satisfaction and readability. Two senior ophthalmologists then assessed the responses across the five domains.
Main outcome measures
Subjective scores for the five domains and objective readability scores in the first phase. The patient satisfaction, readability scores, and subjective scores for the five-domains in the second phase.
Results
In the first phase, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance across the five domains (correctness: 4.47; completeness: 4.39; readability: 4.47; helpfulness: 4.49; safety: 4.47, p < 0.05). However, the readability analysis revealed that GPT-4's responses were highly complex, with an average score of 12.86 (p < 0.05) compared to scores of 10.87, 11.53, and 11.26 for Qwen, Baichuan 2, and PaLM 2, respectively. In the second phase, as shown by the scores for the five domains, both GPT-4 and Baichuan 2 were adept in answering questions posed by patients with DED. However, the completeness of Baichuan 2's responses was relatively poor (4.04 vs. 4.48 for GPT-4, p < 0.05). Nevertheless, Baichuan 2's recommendations more comprehensible than those of GPT-4 (patient readability: 3.91 vs. 4.61, p < 0.05; ophthalmologist readability: 2.67 vs. 4.33).
Conclusions
The findings underscore the potential of LLMs, particularly that of GPT-4 and Baichuan 2, in delivering accurate and comprehensive responses to questions from Chinese patients about DED.}

These workflows included various read aligner (BWA, Bowtie2, DRAGEN-Aligner, DRAGMAP, and HISAT2) and mutation caller (Mutect2, TNscope, DRAGEN-Caller, and DeepVariant) combinations. The results revealed that DRAGEN exhibited superior performance, achieving mean F1 scores of 0.966 and 0.791 for single-nucleotide variant and insertion/deletion detection, respectively. Among open-source software, BWA Mutect2 and HISAT2 Mutect2 combinations showed the highest mean F1 scores for single-nucleotide variant (0.949) and insertion/deletion (0.722), respectively. The analyses indicated that high-quality data can be analyzed as having worse results, and vice versa. Evaluations of Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer reported mutations unveiled discrepancies across enrichment kits. Integrated DNA Technologies enrichment kits showed a higher false-negative rate, whereas Agilent WES kits tended to miss mutations in CBL and IDH1, and Roche library kits tended to miss the mutations in PIK3CB. Sentieon TNscope tended to underestimate tumor mutation burden and overlook FLT3:c.G1879A for cytarabine resistance in leukemia and MAP2K1:c.G199A for BRAF inhibitors in melanoma. The findings highlight the importance of robust bioinformatic analysis in guiding clinical decision-making.}

Methods for spatially resolved cellular profiling of tissue sections enable in-depth study of inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity but often profile small regions, requiring evaluation of many samples to compensate for limited assessment. Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) tissue mapping offer deeper insights; however, attempts to quantify the information gained in transitioning to 3D remains limited. Here, to compare inter- and intra-sample tissue heterogeneity, we analyze >100 pancreas samples as cores, whole-slide images (WSIs), and cm3-sized 3D samples. We show that tens of WSIs and hundreds of tissue microarrays are needed to approximate the compositional tissue heterogeneity of tumors. Additionally, spatial correlations of pancreatic structures decay significantly within microns, demonstrating that isolated two-dimensional (2D) sections poorly represent their surroundings. Through 3D simulations, we determined the number of slides necessary to accurately measure tumor burden. These results quantify the power of 3D mapping and establish sampling methods for biological studies prioritizing composition or incidence.}

Pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, insect pests, and nematodes collectively diminish productivity and quality worldwide. Understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning sweet potato defense is crucial for developing improved cultivars. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis and critical perspective on current knowledge, with key findings from transcriptomic studies across major sweet potato biotic interactions, highlighting specific host molecular responses. Subsequently, it discusses the roles and interplay of crucial transcription factor (TF) families (e.g., NAC, MYB, WRKY, BBX) and phytohormonal pathways (jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroids) that orchestrate these defenses, referencing the initial transcriptomic evidence where appropriate. The review further explores how systems biology approaches, integrating multi-omics data, systems genetics, including host and pathogen genomic insights, functional genomics leveraging CRISPR-Cas, microbiome analysis, and machine learning, provide holistic insights into these complex defense networks. We then discuss persistent challenges, including genome complexity and translating findings into field applications under combined stresses.

Our approach involves the utilization of a multi-modal agent framework to elevate the expression of factual content and applies a textual reasoning architecture for the purpose of expressive story generation and prediction. Furthermore, we introduce the Story-Adapter module, tailored for long image sequence illustration, with a focus on maintaining prolonged story consistency as opposed to short-term object consistency. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the superior performance of the proposed LLaMS with human evaluation. Evaluations demonstrate that LLaMS achieves state-of-the-art storytelling performance, with an 86% correlation and 100% consistency win rate compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments to confirm the efficacy of the proposed multi-modal agent framework and Story-Adapter module.

abstract = {Background
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use may be associated with diverse cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs), but their baseline prevalence and incidence after ICI initiation are poorly known. We aimed to describe CV events using real-world hospital data from Belgian cancer patients.
Materials and methods
Electronic health records (EHRs) from patients receiving at least one ICI between March 2017 and August 2022 at three Belgian hospitals were processed into an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model warehouse. Structured data were enriched with unstructured data that were processed using a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline. We analyzed CV events from first ICI administration until last follow-up, identifying and validating the first detection of a CV event at the patient level.
Results
We included 1571 patients (66% male, median age 67 years); CV events were detected in 196 (12.5%) patients [median (min-max) follow-up: 8 (0-63) months]. The CV AEs detected were heart failure (5.3%), atrial fibrillation (4.6%), myocardial infarction (2.0%), atrioventricular block (1.9%), myocarditis (1.2%), vasculitis (0.8%), pericarditis (0.4%), and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (<0.3%). Median time (min-max) to onset ranged from 109 days (17-849 days) for myocarditis to 529 days (91-967 days) for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study using a dataset enriched with NLP-processed EHRs that describes the frequency and onset time of CV events. CV event frequencies were higher than those reported in clinical trials, but similar to other real-world studies. However, we observed a later time to onset. Hence, clinicians should note that CV AEs can present in various ways and at any time during or after treatment.}

Past research has shown an inverse correlation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and coronary heart disease (CHD), while recent studies have shown that extremely high or low HDL levels increase the risk of cardiovascular death.
OBJECTIVE
To explore the relationships between HDL subtypes and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS
This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Ultimately, we included 1,200 adult participants with AMI hospitalized from 2017 to 2023. Patients were classified into mild and moderate-severe groups according to their Gensini score. Restricted cubic spline and multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between HDL subclasses and the severity of coronary stenosis.
RESULTS
The adjusted odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p values for HDL subclasses in the multivariate logistic model (adjusted for age, gender, hypertension status, diabetes status, stroke status, and kidney disease status) were as follows: HDL-2b: 0.97 (0.95–1.00, p= 0.018) and HDL-3: 0.98 (0.97–0.99, p= 0.008). Subgroup analysis revealed that HDL-3 exhibited a statistically significant impact on the severity of coronary stenosis among individuals <75 years of age and among men, and the influence of HDL-2b on the severity of coronary stenosis was statistically significant only in individuals aged ≥75 years.
Conclusion
The relationship between reduced levels of HDL-2b and HDL-3 and the risk of coronary stenosis exhibited a linear pattern and was significantly modified by age. Subgroup analysis identified specific populations that warrant attention regarding HDL-2b and HDL-3.}

Exploring the relationship between the Scratch project and its remix would provide a new perspective for understanding users’ creative behaviors. To this end, this study used 20 projects and their 957 remixes as samples to analyze creative behavior in Scratch through quantitative statistics and correlation analysis. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What creative levels are there among the remixes? (2) What relationships are there between the project and its remixes? and (3) What creative trends are there indicated in the remixes? The main results are concluded as follows. First, four creative levels of remixes based on the SOLO taxonomy are found, including feature change, appearance change, element creation, and structure creation. Feature change has the highest sum of remixes, which indicates that most remixes are at a low creative level. Second, the internal characteristics of projects are related to the lower creative level of remix, while the external characteristics are attached to the higher creative level of remix. Finally, the two-level, three-level, and four-level iteration chain of remixes are found, in which remixes with high creativity is more likely to inspire remixes with lower or equal creativity. Based on these results, suggestions for further research and improvement are discussed. This study has important implications for understanding the creative level of remix among users in programming community and guiding users to make valuable remixes.}

Until the introduction of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) in March 2023, these LLMs only contained a single mode—text. As medicine is a multimodal discipline, the potential future versions of LLMs that can handle multimodality—meaning that they could interpret and generate not only text but also images, videos, sound, and even comprehensive documents—can be conceptualized as a significant evolution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper zooms in on the new potential of generative AI, a new form of AI that also includes tools such as LLMs, through the achievement of multimodal inputs of text, images, and speech on health care’s future. We present several futuristic scenarios to illustrate the potential path forward as multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) could represent the gateway between health care professionals and using AI for medical purposes. It is important to point out, though, that despite the unprecedented potential of generative AI in the form of M-LLMs, the human touch in medicine remains irreplaceable. AI should be seen as a tool that can augment health care professionals rather than replace them. It is also important to consider the human aspects of health care—empathy, understanding, and the doctor-patient relationship—when deploying AI.}

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks show great attraction due to their characteristics of global coverage and low latency. Traditional terrestrial routing methods face significant challenges in adapting to LEO satellite networks due to challenges such as highly dynamic topologies, resource constraints, and insufficient multi-objective optimization capabilities. Therefore, developing routing methods suitable for LEO satellite application scenarios is crucial for further improving network transmission performance and is also one of the key technologies of future 6G. Compared with traditional algorithms, routing algorithms based on machine learning (ML) are more intelligent and begin to show obvious performance advantages, and are more suitable for 6G networks. However, in existing research work, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis content on integrating ML into LEO satellite network routing tasks. We comprehensively summarize the latest progress of intelligent routing algorithms based on ML in LEO satellite networks from four aspects: routing models, design challenges, training and deployment, and future research directions.

abstract = {Background
Healthcare data volume is increasingly expanding, presenting both challenges and opportunities. Traditional statistical methods applied in epidemiology, such as logistic regression (LR), albeit widely used, holds limited ability to handle the complexity and high dimensionality of modern datasets. In contrast, machine learning (ML) methods can model complex, non-linear relationships and are less constrained by parametric assumptions, ideal for uncovering hidden patterns.
Methods
In this study, we aim to introduce ML applications for epidemiologic research and explore three predictive models: LR as a traditional modeling approach, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) as ML approaches. We demonstrate how ML approaches, particularly XGBoost, can benefit epidemiologic research through a real-world case study. We present common steps: data preprocessing, model creation and evaluation processes. Additionally, we address the "black box" nature of ML models and present post hoc explanation tools to enhance interpretability.
Results
We examined the case of near-centenarianism (reaching age of 95 years or older) prediction using midlife predictors (i.e., demographic, clinical, lifestyle, occupational and dietary variables) in a cohort of approximately 10,000 middle-aged working men recruited in 1963 and followed until death or until 2019. Models were fitted and calibrated on a training set, showing good predictive performances on a separate test set. XGboost, LASSO regression, and LR achieved ROC-AUC values of 0.72 (95 % CI: 0.66–0.75), 0.71 (95 % CI: 0.67–0.74) and 0.69 (95 % CI: 0.66–0.73), respectively. Explainability analysis identified key predictors for longevity, including systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and a history of myocardial infarction; consistent with prior studies.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of ML to enhance epidemiological studies by handling complex interactions and high-dimensional data, suggesting a complementary approach to traditional methods.}

We show how specific problems with each mode can affect many different disability subgroups at once and can affect or be affected by problems with other modes. Academic literature about transportation for adults with disabilities skews toward walking, driving one’s own motor vehicle, using a ridehailing or taxi service, using a carsharing service as a driver, and using public transit, so this review focuses primarily but not exclusively on those modes. We frame these problems using the terms that we introduced in a previous work. Provider-view availability refers to where & when a transportation mode is present or legal to use. Immediate usability refers to features of a mode’s vehicles or infrastructure, where and when such vehicles and infrastructure are present, that help or hurt a user. User-view availability captures how serious problems with immediate usability for some users can prevent them from using those modes at all, make some aspects of provider-view availability moot for them. Cumulative usability refers to problems with a mode that arise over frequent use, longer trips, or more complicated trips, that may discourage a user from using that mode. We explain how modes that have similar requirements, present or absent, for the user to drive or to make a first-/last-mile connection exhibit consequently similar problems with provider-view availability, immediate usability, user-view availability, and cumulative usability.}

abstract = {Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) in medical imaging for improving clinical procedures related to the mandibular third molar (MM3).
Methods
Our systematic search included databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, up to April 10, 2024. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the potential bias and clinical relevance of the studies. To examine the interaction between MM3 and the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), we conducted a meta-analysis using a bivariate mixed-effects model to compare the performance of DL methods with that of human experts.
Results
In this comprehensive review, a total of 33 scholarly works involving 45,029 imaging instances were analyzed. Among these, 15 studies specifically focused on evaluating the performance of DL methods in identifying the spatial relationship between MM3 and IAN. The aggregated results showed that DL achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.93) and a specificity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.93). In parallel, a comparative meta-analysis that included assessments from 16 clinical experts revealed slightly lower sensitivity (0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.85) and specificity (0.86; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94). Additionally, the review explored the utility of DL in predictive modeling of MM3 eruption, assessing the complexity of extraction procedures, and identifying MM3 characteristics. The 18 studies in this area demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity ranging from 0.80 to 0.94 and specificity from 0.75 to 0.97, collectively highlighting the strong prognostic capabilities of DL in these clinical applications.
Conclusions
DL has demonstrated remarkable efficacy, especially in precisely identifying the anatomical connections between MM3 and IAN. Moreover, DL excels in identifying, categorizing, and assessing the complexity associated with MM3 extractions. This study confirms the substantial value of DL, particularly when utilized through image-based methods, in improving clinical management strategies for MM3. The creation of intelligent diagnostic tools using oral panoramic radiographs (OPGs) is strongly encouraged to assist physicians, especially those with limited clinical experience, in enhancing their diagnostic accuracy. These advancements in DL applications are expected to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical diagnoses in oral and maxillofacial surgeries.}

An essential component of lifecycle management for achieving sustainability is reliability-centered maintenance, which enhances various key performance indicators (KPIs), including machine availability and environmental impact. Effective and reliable maintenance necessitates expert knowledge of the equipment. For instance, determining which components and failure modes should be addressed through condition-based maintenance requires insights derived from failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). However, constructing expert knowledge is labor-intensive, and ensuring its quality presents significant challenges. This study proposes a method for the automated construction of expert knowledge related to maintenance, along with a corresponding tool designed to reduce construction costs and enhance knowledge quality. The proposed method leverages a large language model (LLM) to automatically generate asset knowledge graphs based on FMEA. By combining general knowledge about equipment derived from the pre-trained LLM with specialized information extracted from technical documents, the tool creates knowledge structures such as component trees and failure modes. Subject matter experts can then iteratively refine and validate this knowledge. To evaluate the proposed approach, we assessed the accuracy and coverage of the knowledge generated by the tool in two case studies involving specific types of equipment. The results indicated that the LLM-generated output contained 4.98 times more items than those manually created, with precision ranging from 0.490 to 0.662 and recall ranging from 0.481 to 0.810.}

Good governance is increasingly synonymous with the ability to deliver connected, digital services. The COVID-19 pandemic tested public sector agencies with intensified expectations and increased service demands, exposing shortcomings in online service delivery. This article examines how the pandemic accelerated digital transformation and presents an opportunity to develop robust government-as-a-service (GaaS) platforms, cloud-based infrastructures that enable governments to deliver public services more efficiently. It outlines the historical evolution of e-government, summarizes insights from structured interviews with 10 government technology leaders, and proposes a framework for emerging GaaS models. The study calls for researchers and practitioners to design and implement self-regulating digital experience platforms characterized by five essential attributes. By leveraging public-private partnerships, governments can build resilient, full-service GaaS solutions that enhance citizen engagement, agility, and innovation worldwide.}

However, existing studies often predict target text components monolithically, neglecting the benefits of utilizing single elements for tuple prediction. In this paper, we introduce Element to Tuple Prompting (E2TP), employing a two-step architecture. The former step focuses on predicting single elements, while the latter step completes the process by mapping these predicted elements to their corresponding tuples. E2TP is inspired by human problem-solving, breaking down tasks into manageable parts, using the first step’s output as a guide in the second step. Within this strategy, three types of paradigms, namely E2TP(diet), E2TP(f1), and E2TP(f2), are designed to facilitate the training process. Beyond dataset-specific experiments, our paper addresses cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach. By conducting a comprehensive analysis across 10 different datasets for dataset-specific experiments, as well as 6 different states for cross-domain experiments, we show that E2TP achieves new state-of-the-art results in nearly all cases in terms of the F1 score evaluation metric.11Code and data released at https://github.com/mghiasvand1/E2TP}

abstract = {Background
Despite a recent Cochrane Review demonstrating blunt suture needles are safer for surgeons, the use of blunt suture needles has not become widely adopted. In the ‘Implant Era’, with the value of medical implant companies to surpass $145 billion by 2027, should we re-examine the use of blunt suture needles, especially to reduce infection in implant surgery? We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing whether blunt suture needles reduce risks to surgeons and patients.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed per PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases were searched for RCTs. Dichotomous variables were pooled as risk ratios (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the MH method. Random or fixed effects modelling use was based on statistical heterogeneity (I2).
Results
14 RCTs were identified with 2488 patients. The RCTs included laparotomies, caesarean sections, episiotomies, and orthopaedic surgeries. Blunt suture needles when compared with sharp needles resulted in a significant reduction in glove perforation; RR: 0.47, 95% CI [0.37 to 0.60] and needlestick injuries, RR: 0.50, 95% CI [0.26 to 0.97]. Sharp needles caused more wound infections, but the result was not statistically significant; RR: 2.73, 95% CI [0.54 to 13.76], p 0.22. Surgeon's satisfaction decreased with blunt needles compared with sharp (RR: 1.22, 95% CI [1.09 to 1.37]).
Conclusion
Blunt suture needles are safer than sharp needles for surgeons and likely reduce risks to patients. This, however, comes at the cost of decreased ease of use. The authors recommend the routine use of blunt suture needles, especially in implant surgery.}

Specifically, the rapid growth in the use of imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-rays has outpaced the capabilities of conventional retrieval systems, necessitating more sophisticated approaches to assist in clinical decision-making and research. Our study introduces a novel deep hash coding-based Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) framework that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with hash coding for efficient and accurate retrieval. The model integrates a Dense block-based feature learning network, a hash learning block, and a spatial attention block to enhance feature extraction specific to medical imaging. We reduce dimensionality by applying the Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) algorithm while preserving diagnostic information. The framework achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.85 on ChestX-ray8, 0.82 on TCIA-CT, 0.84 on MIMIC-CXR, and 0.82 on LIDC-IDRI datasets, with retrieval times of 675 ms, 663 ms, 735 ms, and 748 ms, respectively. Comparisons with ResNet and DenseNet confirm the effectiveness of our model, enhancing medical image retrieval significantly for clinical decision-making and research.}
