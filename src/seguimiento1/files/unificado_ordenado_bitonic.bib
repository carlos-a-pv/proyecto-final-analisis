    abstract = {With the increasing development of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have been utilized to solve problems in natural language processing tasks. More recently, LLMs have shown unique potential in numerous applications within medicine but have been particularly investigated for their ability in clinical reasoning. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist. However, the physician maintained a significantly higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and LLaMa 2 for either disease. Overall, we explore and discuss the unique potential of LLMs in diagnostics for autoimmune diseases.},

It has the potential to radically transform the business landscape, with consequences for operations and supply chain management (O&SCM). However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI's effects in O&SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. We collected data from O&SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters. Adopters also display diverse behavioral patterns toward efficiency, agility, responsiveness, etc. This study provides valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in comprehending Gen-AI/ChatGPT's implications in O&SCM for both adopters and non-adopters. Additionally, it underscores the importance of organizational learning processes in facilitating successful Gen-AI/ChatGPT adoption in O&SCM.},

Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 % of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a key component of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications for creating new content including text, imagery, audio, code, and videos in response to textual instructions. Without human oversight, guidance and responsible design and operation, such generative AI applications will remain a party trick with substantial potential for creating and spreading misinformation or harmful and inaccurate content at unprecedented scale. However, if positioned and developed responsibly as companions to humans augmenting but not replacing their role in decision making, knowledge retrieval and other cognitive processes, they could evolve into highly efficient, trustworthy, assistive tools for information management. This perspective describes how such tools could transform data management workflows in healthcare and medicine, explains how the underlying technology works, provides an assessment of risks and limitations, and proposes an ethical, technical, and cultural framework for responsible design, development, and deployment. It seeks to incentivise users, developers, providers, and regulators of generative AI that utilises LLMs to collectively prepare for the transformational role this technology could play in evidence-based sectors.},

One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.},

    abstract = {Background
The use of generative artificial intelligence, more specifically large language models (LLMs), is proliferating, and as such, it is vital to consider both the value and potential harms of its use in medical education. Their efficiency in a variety of writing styles makes LLMs, such as ChatGPT, attractive for tailoring educational materials. However, this technology can feature biases and misinformation, which can be particularly harmful in medical education settings, such as mental health and substance use education. This viewpoint investigates if ChatGPT is sufficient for 2 common health education functions in the field of mental health and substance use: (1) answering users’ direct queries and (2) aiding in the development of quality consumer educational health materials.
Objective
This viewpoint includes a case study to provide insight into the accessibility, biases, and quality of ChatGPT’s query responses and educational health materials. We aim to provide guidance for the general public and health educators wishing to utilize LLMs.
Methods
We collected real world queries from 2 large-scale mental health and substance use portals and engineered a variety of prompts to use on GPT-4 Pro with the Bing BETA internet browsing plug-in. The outputs were evaluated with tools from the Sydney Health Literacy Lab to determine the accessibility, the adherence to Mindframe communication guidelines to identify biases, and author assessments on quality, including tailoring to audiences, duty of care disclaimers, and evidence-based internet references.
Results
GPT-4’s outputs had good face validity, but upon detailed analysis were substandard in comparison to expert-developed materials. Without engineered prompting, the reading level, adherence to communication guidelines, and use of evidence-based websites were poor. Therefore, all outputs still required cautious human editing and oversight.
Conclusions
GPT-4 is currently not reliable enough for direct-consumer queries, but educators and researchers can use it for creating educational materials with caution. Materials created with LLMs should disclose the use of generative artificial intelligence and be evaluated on their efficacy with the target audience.},

    abstract = {Background
In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Google Bard, a generative artificial intelligence (AI) platform.
Methods
We searched published case reports from our department for difficult or uncommon case descriptions and mock cases created by physicians for common case descriptions. We entered the case descriptions into the prompt of Google Bard to generate the top 10 differential-diagnosis lists. As in previous studies, other physicians created differential-diagnosis lists by reading the same clinical descriptions.
Results
A total of 82 clinical descriptions (52 case reports and 30 mock cases) were used. The accuracy rates of physicians were still higher than Google Bard in the top 10 (56.1% vs 82.9%, P < .001), the top 5 (53.7% vs 78.0%, P = .002), and the top differential diagnosis (40.2% vs 64.6%, P = .003). Even within the specific context of case reports, physicians consistently outperformed Google Bard. When it came to mock cases, the performances of the differential-diagnosis lists by Google Bard were no different from those of the physicians in the top 10 (80.0% vs 96.6%, P = .11) and the top 5 (76.7% vs 96.6%, P = .06), except for those in the top diagnoses (60.0% vs 90.0%, P = .02).
Conclusion
While physicians excelled overall, and particularly with case reports, Google Bard displayed comparable diagnostic performance in common cases. This suggested that Google Bard possesses room for further improvement and refinement in its diagnostic capabilities. Generative AIs, including Google Bard, are anticipated to become increasingly beneficial in augmenting diagnostic accuracy.},

    abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) tools, although beneficial for data collection and analysis, can also facilitate scientific fraud. AI detectors can help resolve this problem, but their effectiveness depends on their ability to track AI progress. In addition, many methods of evading AI detection exist and their constantly evolving sophistication can make the task more difficult. Thus, from an AI-generated text, we wanted to: (1) evaluate the AI detection sites on a text generated entirely by the AI, (2) test the methods described for evading AI detection, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of these methods to evade AI detection on the sites tested previously.
Hypothesis
Not all AI detection tools are equally effective in detecting AI-generated text and some techniques used to evade AI detection can make an AI-produced text almost undetectable.
Materials and methods
We created a text with ChatGPT-4 (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and submitted it to 11 AI detection web tools (Originality, ZeroGPT, Writer, Copyleaks, Crossplag, GPTZero, Sapling, Content at scale, Corrector, Writefull et Quill), before and after applying strategies to minimise AI detection. The strategies used to minimize AI detection were the improvement of command messages in ChatPGT, the introduction of minor grammatical errors such as comma deletion, paraphrasing, and the substitution of Latin letters with similar Cyrillic letters (а and о) which is also a method used elsewhere to evade the detection of plagiarism. We have also tested the effectiveness of these tools in correctly identifying a scientific text written by a human in 1960.
Results
From the initial text generated by the AI, 7 of the 11 detectors concluded that the text was mainly written by humans. Subsequently, the introduction of simple modifications, such as the removal of commas or paraphrasing can effectively reduce AI detection and make the text appear human for all detectors. In addition, replacing certain Latin letters with Cyrillic letters can make an AI text completely undetectable. Finally, we observe that in a paradoxical way, certain sites detect a significant proportion of AI in a text written by a human in 1960.
Discussion
AI detectors have low efficiency, and simple modifications can allow even the most robust detectors to be easily bypassed. The rapid development of generative AI raises questions about the future of scientific writing but also about the detection of scientific fraud, such as data fabrication.

@article{SHIMIZU2023,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), represented by large language models, have the potential to transform health care and medical education. In particular, GAI’s impact on higher education has the potential to change students’ learning experience as well as faculty’s teaching. However, concerns have been raised about ethical consideration and decreased reliability of the existing examinations. Furthermore, in medical education, curriculum reform is required to adapt to the revolutionary changes brought about by the integration of GAI into medical practice and research.
Objective
This study analyzes the impact of GAI on medical education curricula and explores strategies for adaptation.
Methods
The study was conducted in the context of faculty development at a medical school in Japan. A workshop involving faculty and students was organized, and participants were divided into groups to address two research questions: (1) How does GAI affect undergraduate medical education curricula? and (2) How should medical school curricula be reformed to address the impact of GAI? The strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) framework was used, and cross-SWOT matrix analysis was used to devise strategies. Further, 4 researchers conducted content analysis on the data generated during the workshop discussions.
Results
The data were collected from 8 groups comprising 55 participants. Further, 5 themes about the impact of GAI on medical education curricula emerged: improvement of teaching and learning, improved access to information, inhibition of existing learning processes, problems in GAI, and changes in physicians’ professionality. Positive impacts included enhanced teaching and learning efficiency and improved access to information, whereas negative impacts included concerns about reduced independent thinking and the adaptability of existing assessment methods. Further, GAI was perceived to change the nature of physicians’ expertise. Three themes emerged from the cross-SWOT analysis for curriculum reform: (1) learning about GAI, (2) learning with GAI, and (3) learning aside from GAI. Participants recommended incorporating GAI literacy, ethical considerations, and compliance into the curriculum. Learning with GAI involved improving learning efficiency, supporting information gathering and dissemination, and facilitating patient involvement. Learning aside from GAI emphasized maintaining GAI-free learning processes, fostering higher cognitive domains of learning, and introducing more communication exercises.
Conclusions
This study highlights the profound impact of GAI on medical education curricula and provides insights into curriculum reform strategies. Participants recognized the need for GAI literacy, ethical education, and adaptive learning. Further, GAI was recognized as a tool that can enhance efficiency and involve patients in education. The study also suggests that medical education should focus on competencies that GAI hardly replaces, such as clinical experience and communication. Notably, involving both faculty and students in curriculum reform discussions fosters a sense of ownership and ensures broader perspectives are encompassed.},

VR technology faces a number of ethical issues, including a reduction of users’ autonomy, health problems, and privacy concerns. The use of VR and realism in education can turn out to be a double-edged sword. While realistic visualizations can promote learning for some content domains, they can hinder comprehension in others. Furthermore, the effects of realism on learning also depend on learners’ spatial abilities. Letting young children and teenagers engage in virtual educational experiences can expose them to manipulation, could lead to health issues, and may infringe on their privacy. In short, realism and virtual experiences may severely limit learners’ autonomy in a number of ways. Based on a review of the literature and considerations of emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence, this paper presents guidelines for the ethically sound utilization of VR and realism. By applying findings and conclusions established in the context of research on the ethics of VR to the educational utilization of this technology, I develop several suggestions that may help to avoid negative consequences of educational VR. These suggestions include the utilization of spatial ability testing, requiring virtual experiences to offer alternative paths to prevent manipulation, as well as using algorithms that deidentify the highly detailed developmental profiles that can be generated through educational VR use.},

    abstract = {Background
The increasing application of generative artificial intelligence large language models (LLMs) in various fields, including dentistry, raises questions about their accuracy.
Objective
This study aims to comparatively evaluate the answers provided by 4 LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bing Chat (Microsoft Corp), to clinically relevant questions from the field of dentistry.
Methods
The LLMs were queried with 20 open-type, clinical dentistry–related questions from different disciplines, developed by the respective faculty of the School of Dentistry, European University Cyprus. The LLMs’ answers were graded 0 (minimum) to 10 (maximum) points against strong, traditionally collected scientific evidence, such as guidelines and consensus statements, using a rubric, as if they were examination questions posed to students, by 2 experienced faculty members. The scores were statistically compared to identify the best-performing model using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. Moreover, the evaluators were asked to provide a qualitative evaluation of the comprehensiveness, scientific accuracy, clarity, and relevance of the LLMs’ answers.
Results
Overall, no statistically significant difference was detected between the scores given by the 2 evaluators; therefore, an average score was computed for every LLM. Although ChatGPT-4 statistically outperformed ChatGPT-3.5 (P=.008), Bing Chat (P=.049), and Bard (P=.045), all models occasionally exhibited inaccuracies, generality, outdated content, and a lack of source references. The evaluators noted instances where the LLMs delivered irrelevant information, vague answers, or information that was not fully accurate.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that although LLMs hold promising potential as an aid in the implementation of evidence-based dentistry, their current limitations can lead to potentially harmful health care decisions if not used judiciously. Therefore, these tools should not replace the dentist’s critical thinking and in-depth understanding of the subject matter. Further research, clinical validation, and model improvements are necessary for these tools to be fully integrated into dental practice. Dental practitioners must be aware of the limitations of LLMs, as their imprudent use could potentially impact patient care. Regulatory measures should be established to oversee the use of these evolving technologies.},

    abstract = {This article explores the potential advantages of corpora over generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in understanding language patterns and usage, while also acknowledging the potential of GenAI to address some of the main shortcomings of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL). One of the main advantages of corpora is that we know exactly the domain of texts from which the corpus data is derived, something that we cannot track from current large language models underlying applications like ChatGPT. We know the texts that make up large general corpora such as BNC2014 and BAWE, and can even extract full texts from these corpora if needed. Corpora also allow for more nuanced analysis of language patterns, including the statistics behind multi-word units and collocations, which can be difficult for GenAI to handle. However, it is important to note that GenAI has its own strengths in advancing our understanding of language-in-use that corpora, to date, have struggled with. We therefore argue that by combining corpus and GenAI approaches, language learners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how language works in different contexts than is currently possible using only a single approach.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”).},

    abstract = {The public release of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools (e.g., ChatGPT) has had a disruptive effect on the assessment practices of higher education institutions (HEIs) worldwide. Concerns have largely been associated with academic integrity, cheating and plagiarism. HEIs have had to develop guidelines in response to GAI. As many of these guidelines were developed in haste and could affect a large number of instructors and students, there is a need to examine their content, coverage and suitability. This review examines the extent to which the world's 50 top-ranking HEIs have developed or modified their assessment guidelines to address GAI use and, where guidelines exist, the primary content and advice given to guide instructors in their GAI assessment design and practices. The findings show that just under half of the institutions have developed publicly available guidelines. The guidelines cover three main areas: academic integrity, advice on assessment design and communicating with students. Amongst the suggestions for teachers on assessment design, two appear particularly pertinent in helping develop effective assessment tasks and developing learners’ AI literacy: first, running assessment tasks through GAI to check the extent to which the tool can accomplish the task and, second, having students use GAI as part of the assessment process. Overall, the review suggests that HEIs have come to accept the use of GAI and drafted assessment guidelines to advise instructors on its use. In the article, we argue that it may be beneficial to embrace GAI as a part of the assessment process since this is the reality of today's educational and job landscape. This will require instructors to develop a new competence - generative artificial intelligence assessment literacy - which is conceptualised in this article.},

This creates a dilemma for management educators wanting to utilise the technology whilst staying relevant but also interested in authentic learning. Thus, it is critical for management educators to quickly implement policies regarding ChatGPT and subsequent new generative artificial intelligence because of its ease of use and affordability. This article is conceptual in nature and discusses ChatGPT as a generative form of artificial intelligence that presents challenges for management educators that need to be addressed through appropriate strategies. Thereby contributing to the literature on how technological innovations can be included in curriculum design and management learning practices. Practical and managerial implications are stated that highlight the critical need to re-examine existing education practices as a way of incorporating new technological innovation that can be utilised in a beneficial way.},

The development of natural language processing (NLP) tools, such as GPT-4, can accelerate the extraction of published information related to microbial performance under complex strain engineering and bioreactor conditions. As a proof of concept, we proposed prompt engineering for a GPT-4 workflow pipeline to extract knowledge from 176 publications on two oleaginous yeasts (Yarrowia lipolytica and Rhodosporidium toruloides). After human intervention, the pipeline obtained a total of 2037 data instances. The structured data sets and feature selections enabled ML approaches (e.g., a random forest model) to predict Yarrowia fermentation titers with decent accuracy (R 2 of 0.86 for unseen test data). Via transfer learning, the trained model could assess the production potential of the engineered nonconventional yeast, R. toruloides, for which there are fewer published reports. This work demonstrated the potential of generative artificial intelligence to streamline information extraction from research articles, thereby facilitating fermentation predictions and biomanufacturing development.},

@article{SHARMASHARMA2023150,
    abstract = {Purpose
Empirical attempts to recommend enabling mechanisms for organizational unlearning are sparse and have almost neglected the vital role of leadership in transforming organizations through unlearning. Based on the tenets of persistence theories like path-dependence and imprinting theory, this study examines the relationship between transformational leadership and unlearning with the mediating role of knowledge sharing, transparent internal communication and intrapreneurship.
Design/methodology/approach
To analyze the hypothesized relationship between these constructs, data were collected from 452 faculty members working in Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs) in India. The data were analyzed using Process macro (Hayes, 2022).
Findings
The results show a significant effect of transformational leadership on organizational unlearning. This effect is mediated by transparent internal communication and intrapreneurship. However, knowledge sharing did not mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and organizational unlearning.
Practical implications
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Covid-19, the rise of generative artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and policy reforms have pushed higher educational institutions to transform by unlearning old practices and experimenting with new ones. This paper informs how educational institutions can initiate and sustain the unlearning process.

Persistence theories like path-dependence and imprinting theory suggest that organizations often stick with proven success formulas and find it challenging to adopt new practices. Moreover, path dependence theorists advocate the role of an external intervening mechanism to break away from rigid and inefficient routines (or paths). This paper argues that in addition to external events (e.g. crisis, etc.), transformational leaders combined with organizational processes also help in unlearning obsolete knowledge and routines.},

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
Artificial intelligence (AI) generative models driven by the integration of AI and natural language processing technologies, such as OpenAI’s chatbot generative pre-trained transformer large language model (LLM), are receiving much public attention and have the potential to transform personalized medicine. Dialysis patients are highly dependent on technology and their treatment generates a challenging large volume of data that has to be analyzed for knowledge extraction. We argue that, by integrating the data acquired from hemodialysis treatments with the powerful conversational capabilities of LLMs, nephrologists could personalize treatments adapted to patients’ lifestyles and preferences. We also argue that this new conversational AI integrated with a personalized patient-computer interface will enhance patients’ engagement and self-care by providing them with a more personalized experience. However, generative AI models require continuous and accurate updates of data, and expert supervision and must address potential biases and limitations. Dialysis patients can also benefit from other new emerging technologies such as Digital Twins with which patients’ care can also be addressed from a personalized medicine perspective. In this paper, we will revise LLMs potential strengths in terms of their contribution to personalized medicine, and, in particular, their potential impact, and limitations in nephrology. Nephrologists’ collaboration with AI academia and companies, to develop algorithms and models that are more transparent, understandable, and trustworthy, will be crucial for the next generation of dialysis patients. The combination of technology, patient-specific data, and AI should contribute to create a more personalized and interactive dialysis process, improving patients’ quality of life.

    abstract = {Data sharing is often hindered by concerns of patient privacy, regulatory aspects, and proprietary interests thereby impeding scientific progress and establishing a gatekeeping mechanism in clinical medicine since obtaining large data sets is costly and time-consuming. We employed two different generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies: CTAB-GAN+ and Normalizing Flows (NFlow) to synthesize clinical trial data based on pooled patient data from four previous multicenter clinical trials of the German Study Alliance Leukemia (AML96, AML2003, AML60+, SORAML) that enrolled adult patients (n=1606) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received intensive induction therapy. As a generative adversarial network (GAN), CTAB-GAN+ consists of two adversarial networks: a generator producing synthetic samples from random noise and a discriminator aiming to distinguish between real and synthetic samples. The model converges as the discriminator can no longer reliably differentiate between real or synthetic data. Contrastingly, NFlow consists of a sequence of invertible transformations (flows) starting from a simple base distribution and gradually adding complexity to better mirror the training data. Both models were trained on tabular data including demographic, laboratory, molecular genetic and cytogenetic patient variables. Detection of molecular alterations in the original cohort was performed via next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 5% variant-allele frequency (VAF) mutation calling cut-off. For cytogenetics, standard techniques for chromosome banding and fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) were used. Hyperparameter tuning of generative models was conducted using the Optuna Framework. For each model, we used a total of 70 optimization trials to optimize a custom score inspired by TabSynDex which assesses both the resemblance of the synthetic data to real training data and its utility. Pairwise analyses were conducted between the original and both synthetic data sets, respectively. All tests were carried out as two-sided tests using a significance level α of 0.05. Table 1 summarizes baseline patient characteristics and outcome for both synthetic cohorts compared to the original cohort. Firstly, we found both models to adequately represent patient features, albeit that some individual variables showed a statistically significant deviation from the original cohort. It is important to note that for such a large sample size (n=1606 for each cohort), even miniscule differences can be rendered statistically significant notwithstanding any meaningful clinical difference. Interestingly, variables that deviated from the original distribution were different for both models indicating model architecture to play a vital role in sample representation: While CTAB-GAN+ showed significant deviations for both age and sex, NFlow showed significant deviations for AML status. Complete remission rate was similar between original (70.7%, odds ratio [OR]: 2.41) and CTAB-GAN+ (73.7%, OR: 2.81, p=0.059) and NFlow (69.1%, OR: 2.24, p=0.356). For event-free survival (EFS), which was not included as a target in hyperparameter tuning, both networks deviated significantly from the original cohort (original: median 7.2 months, HR: 1.36; CTAB-GAN+: median 12.8 months, HR 0.74, p<0.001; NFlow: median 9.0 months, HR: 0.87, p=0.001). Overall survival (OS) was well represented by NFlow compared to the original cohort, while CTAB-GAN+ showed a significant deviation (original: median 17.5 months, HR: 1.14; CTAB-GAN+: median 19.5 months, HR 0.88, p<0.001; NFlow: median 16.2 months, HR: 1.00, p=0.055). Both models showed an adequate graph representation in Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 1). Here, we demonstrate using two different generative AI technologies that synthetic data generation provides an attractive solution to circumvent issues in current standards of data collection and sharing. It effectively allows for bypassing logistical, organizational, and financial burdens, as well as regulatory and ethical concerns. Ultimately, this enables explorative research inquiries into previously inaccessible data sets and offers the prospect of fully synthetic control arms in prospective clinical trials.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly being utilized across various fields, with considerable interest and concern regarding their potential application in medical education. These technologies, such as Chat GPT and Bard, can generate new content and have a wide range of possible applications.
Objective
This study aimed to synthesize the potential opportunities and limitations of generative AI in medical education. It sought to identify prevalent themes within recent literature regarding potential applications and challenges of generative AI in medical education and use these to guide future areas for exploration.
Methods
We conducted a scoping review, following the framework by Arksey and O'Malley, of English language articles published from 2022 onward that discussed generative AI in the context of medical education. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. We screened articles for inclusion, extracted data from relevant studies, and completed a quantitative and qualitative synthesis of the data.
Results
Thematic analysis revealed diverse potential applications for generative AI in medical education, including self-directed learning, simulation scenarios, and writing assistance. However, the literature also highlighted significant challenges, such as issues with academic integrity, data accuracy, and potential detriments to learning. Based on these themes and the current state of the literature, we propose the following 3 key areas for investigation: developing learners’ skills to evaluate AI critically, rethinking assessment methodology, and studying human-AI interactions.
Conclusions
The integration of generative AI in medical education presents exciting opportunities, alongside considerable challenges. There is a need to develop new skills and competencies related to AI as well as thoughtful, nuanced approaches to examine the growing use of generative AI in medical education.},

    abstract = {Digital pathology has transformed the traditional pathology practice of analyzing tissue under a microscope into a computer vision workflow. Whole-slide imaging allows pathologists to view and analyze microscopic images on a computer monitor, enabling computational pathology. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), computational pathology has emerged as a promising field in recent years. Recently, task-specific AI/ML (eg, convolutional neural networks) has risen to the forefront, achieving above-human performance in many image-processing and computer vision tasks. The performance of task-specific AI/ML models depends on the availability of many annotated training datasets, which presents a rate-limiting factor for AI/ML development in pathology. Task-specific AI/ML models cannot benefit from multimodal data and lack generalization, eg, the AI models often struggle to generalize to new datasets or unseen variations in image acquisition, staining techniques, or tissue types. The 2020s are witnessing the rise of foundation models and generative AI. A foundation model is a large AI model trained using sizable data, which is later adapted (or fine-tuned) to perform different tasks using a modest amount of task-specific annotated data. These AI models provide in-context learning, can self-correct mistakes, and promptly adjust to user feedback. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent advances in computational pathology enabled by task-specific AI, their challenges and limitations, and then introduce various foundation models. We propose to create a pathology-specific generative AI based on multimodal foundation models and present its potentially transformative role in digital pathology. We describe different use cases, delineating how it could serve as an expert companion of pathologists and help them efficiently and objectively perform routine laboratory tasks, including quantifying image analysis, generating pathology reports, diagnosis, and prognosis. We also outline the potential role that foundation models and generative AI can play in standardizing the pathology laboratory workflow, education, and training.},

LLMs have been shown to be useful in a myriad of health care–related tasks and processes. In this paper, I argue that attention to, public access to, and debate about LLMs have initiated a wave of products and services using generative artificial intelligence (AI), which had previously found it hard to attract physicians. This paper describes what AI tools have become available since the beginning of the ChatGPT revolution and contemplates how it they might change physicians’ perceptions about this breakthrough technology.},

    abstract = {ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer) is one of the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that have started to be used in programming education. However, the effect of using ChatGPT in programming education on learning processes and outcomes is not yet known. This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings. The research findings, it was emphasized how the most effective use of AI support in the lessons could be made, and various suggestions were made for researchers and educators in this regard.},

    abstract = {Background
Enhanced self-management is crucial for long-term survival following cardiothoracic surgery.
Objectives
This study aimed to develop a conversational agent to enhance patient self-management after cardiothoracic surgery.
Methodology
The solution was designed and implemented following the Design Science Research Methodology. A pilot study was conducted at the hospital to assess the feasibility, usability, and perceived effectiveness of the solution. Feedback was gathered to inform further interactions. Additionally, a focus group with clinicians was conducted to evaluate the acceptability of the solution, integrating insights from the pilot study.
Results
The conversational agent, implemented using a rule-based model, was successfully tested with patients in the cardiothoracic surgery unit (n = 4). Patients received one month of text messages reinforcing clinical team recommendations on a healthy diet and regular physical activity. The system received a high usability score, and two patients suggested adding a feature to answer user prompts for future improvements. The focus group feedback indicated that while the solution met the initial requirements, further testing with a larger patient cohort is necessary to establish personalized profiles. Moreover, clinicians recommended that future iterations prioritize enhanced personalization and interoperability with other hospital platforms. Additionally, while the use of artificial generative intelligence was seen as relevant for content personalization, clinicians expressed concerns regarding content safety, highlighting the necessity for rigorous testing.
Conclusions
This study marks a significant step towards enhancing post-cardiothoracic surgery care through conversational agents. The integration of a diversity of stakeholder knowledge enriches the solution, grants ownership and ensures its sustainability. Future research should focus on automating message generation and delivery based on patient data and environmental factors. While the integration of artificial generative intelligence holds promise for enhancing patient interaction, ensuring the safety of its content is essential.},

    abstract = {The booming Internet economy and generative artificial intelligence have driven the rapid growth of the digital content trading industry, creating an urgent need for the fair protection of the rights of both buyers and sellers. To meet this need, a technique known as buyer–seller watermarking has emerged. Despite its existence, the majority of existing buyer–seller watermarking schemes adopt the owner-side embedding mode, which results in poor scalability. While a handful of schemes adopt the client-side embedding mode to enhance scalability, they either require the deep involvement of a trusted third party or fall short of ensuring complete fairness due to the unresolved unbinding problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fair and scalable watermarking scheme for digital content transactions based on proxy re-encryption and digital signatures. For one thing, this scheme solves the unbinding problem and ensures complete fair protection of the rights of both buyers and sellers. For another, it adopts the client-side embedding mode and has good scalability. Additionally, it eliminates the need for a trusted third party. Finally, theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the intended design goals and possesses superior efficiency advantages.},

    abstract = {Due to the subjectivity of emotions and the limited number of emotion categories, existing deep learning models require assistance to achieve objective, accurate, and flexible personalized music emotion recommendations. This paper introduces a deep learning approach that combines Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and explicitly leverages physiological indicators to enhance the model's intelligence, versatility, and automation. Physiological indicators such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) can be measured using sensors placed on the body's surface, providing more precise information about human emotional changes. This research employs a three-dimensional emotion model, including the tension-arousal axis, energy-arousal axis, and valence axis, to explain the correlation and accuracy between music data and emotions. Based on this, a music emotion classifier is designed, incorporating GAI algorithms to recommend music by matching users' physiological and emotional types with the emotional features of music. The classifier uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to transform audio into Mel-spectrogram as input features. The music emotion selection module adopts a GAI framework of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and integrates multi-scale parallel convolution and attention mechanism modules. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is competitive compared to existing deep learning architectures on PMEmo, RAVDESS, and Soundtrack datasets. Furthermore, due to GAI's efficient classification capability, this model is suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices and other smart devices. The results of this study can be applied to emotion-based music recommendation systems, contributing to emotional interventions and improving the performance of exercise and music therapy.},

@article{HELD2024,
    abstract = {Background
Digital mental health tools, designed to augment traditional mental health treatments, are becoming increasingly important due to a wide range of barriers to accessing mental health care, including a growing shortage of clinicians. Most existing tools use rule-based algorithms, often leading to interactions that feel unnatural compared with human therapists. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution for the development of more natural, engaging digital tools. In this paper, we detail the development of Socrates 2.0, which was designed to engage users in Socratic dialogue surrounding unrealistic or unhelpful beliefs, a core technique in cognitive behavioral therapies. The multiagent LLM-based tool features an artificial intelligence (AI) therapist, Socrates, which receives automated feedback from an AI supervisor and an AI rater. The combination of multiple agents appeared to help address common LLM issues such as looping, and it improved the overall dialogue experience. Initial user feedback from individuals with lived experiences of mental health problems as well as cognitive behavioral therapists has been positive. Moreover, tests in approximately 500 scenarios showed that Socrates 2.0 engaged in harmful responses in under 1% of cases, with the AI supervisor promptly correcting the dialogue each time. However, formal feasibility studies with potential end users are needed.
Objective
This mixed methods study examines the feasibility of Socrates 2.0.
Methods
On the basis of the initial data, we devised a formal feasibility study of Socrates 2.0 to gather qualitative and quantitative data about users’ and clinicians’ experience of interacting with the tool. Using a mixed method approach, the goal is to gather feasibility and acceptability data from 100 users and 50 clinicians to inform the eventual implementation of generative AI tools, such as Socrates 2.0, in mental health treatment. We designed this study to better understand how users and clinicians interact with the tool, including the frequency, length, and time of interactions, users’ satisfaction with the tool overall, quality of each dialogue and individual responses, as well as ways in which the tool should be improved before it is used in efficacy trials. Descriptive and inferential analyses will be performed on data from validated usability measures. Thematic analysis will be performed on the qualitative data.
Results
Recruitment will begin in February 2024 and is expected to conclude by February 2025. As of September 25, 2024, overall, 55 participants have been recruited.
Conclusions
The development of Socrates 2.0 and the outlined feasibility study are important first steps in applying generative AI to mental health treatment delivery and lay the foundation for formal feasibility studies.

Quality services are achieved partly by addressing employee satisfaction, specifically in the work environment. This paper presents a prototype study of a virtual university support agent, a system grounded in a Large Language Model (LLM) engineered to address inquiries from university students, faculty and staff related to the student handbook. The study investigates the integration of generative artificial intelligence and natural conversation properties inherent in LLMs to overcome customer service shortcomings identified in previous chatbot applications. The LLMs’ susceptibility to ‘hallucination’ is mitigated through a combined approach of few-shot learning and chain of thought libraries in the training phase. The information core of this system comprises student handbook PDF files, from which an algorithm extracts and structures data to be utilized by the LLM. As a result, the university support agent facilitates a viable Q&A interface for students, faculty, and administrators to inquire about university guidelines and policies.},

Design
A literature review and analysis of current AI applications and educational programs in ophthalmology.
Methods
Analysis of published studies, reviews, articles, websites, and institutional reports on AI use in ophthalmology. Examination of educational programs incorporating AI, including curriculum frameworks, training methodologies, and evaluations of AI performance on medical examinations and clinical case studies.
Results
Generative AI, particularly LLMs, shows potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care in ophthalmology. Applications include aiding in patient, physician, and medical students’ education. However, challenges such as AI hallucinations, biases, lack of interpretability, and outdated training data limit clinical deployment. Studies revealed varying levels of accuracy of LLMs on ophthalmology board exam questions, underscoring the need for more reliable AI integration. Several educational programs nationwide provide AI and data science training relevant to clinical medicine and ophthalmology.
Conclusions
Generative AI and LLMs offer promising advancements in ophthalmology education and practice. Addressing challenges through comprehensive curricula that include fundamental AI principles, ethical guidelines, and updated, unbiased training data is crucial. Future directions include developing clinically relevant evaluation metrics, implementing hybrid models with human oversight, leveraging image-rich data, and benchmarking AI performance against ophthalmologists.

    abstract = {Background
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have experienced rapid development over the last decade and are gaining increasing popularity as assistive models in academic writing. However, the ability of AI to generate reliable and accurate research articles is a topic of debate. Major scientific journals have issued policies regarding the contribution of AI tools in scientific writing.
Methods
We conducted a review of the author and peer reviewer guidelines of the top 25 Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine journals as per the 2023 SCImago rankings. Data were obtained though reviewing journal websites and directly emailing the editorial office. Descriptive data regarding journal characteristics were coded on SPSS. Subgroup analyses of the journal guidelines were conducted based on the publishing company policies.
Results
Our analysis revealed that all scientific journals in our study permitted the documented use of AI in scientific writing with certain limitations as per ICMJE recommendations. We found that AI tools cannot be included in the authorship or be used for image generation, and that all authors are required to assume full responsibility of their submitted and published work. The use of generative AI tools in the peer review process is strictly prohibited.
Conclusion
Guidelines regarding the use of generative AI in scientific writing are standardized, detailed, and unanimously followed by all journals in our study according to the recommendations set forth by international forums. It is imperative to ensure that these policies are carefully followed and updated to maintain scientific integrity.},

In previous work, we proposed a framework (i.e., the Thera-Turing Test - TTT) for measuring the quality of conversations between users and CAs by independent (potentially blind) therapists, comparing the performance of CAs to human therapists. In this paper, we revised and expanded upon the TTT; by including a new stage of assessment (i.e. testing simulated conversations) and providing further guidance on the phases of the TTT. First, the CA is tested in a safe environment with simulated clients (with Gen AI), instead of human clients; second, the TTT is conducted with a selected sample of actual users; and third, the TTT is conducted with a large sample of users. Adopting this innovative assessment method will guide the future development of mental health CAs, ensuring AI-led interventions meet the rigorous standards expected of human therapists.},

Cross-domain recommender systems (CDRS) have emerged as a favorable solution to solve issues related to cold start, data sparsity, and diversity by leveraging knowledge from the source domains. This systematic literature review delves into the latest deep learning approaches utilized for CDRS, comprehensively analyzing state-of-the-art techniques, methodologies, metrics, datasets, and applications. We systematically review selected primary studies from popular databases covering sixty-eight publications from 2019 to March 2024. The review process involved selecting relevant studies based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the inclusion of high-quality research. Key deep learning (DL) models explored include neural collaborative filtering, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoder, and generative adversarial networks. We also examine the hybrid models that integrate DL with traditional machine learning techniques to enhance recommendation performance. Our findings reveal that DL approaches significantly improve accuracy, cold start, and data sparsity. This review also identifies current trends and future research directions, emphasizing the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), transfer learning, and reinforcement learning in advancing CDRS. In our analysis, we discovered that the domains mainly utilized are movies, books, and music, respectively, and the most widely used evaluation metrics are root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Research challenges and future scope are also highlighted to assist the researchers and practitioners seeking to develop robust cross-domain recommender systems using DL techniques.},

    abstract = {Background:
Digital therapeutics (DTx) in the form of mobile Health (mHealth) self-management programs have shown efficacy in reducing disease activity in different rheumatic diseases, including fibromyalgia and arthritis. They are mostly based on cognitive behavior therapy, lifestyle modification, adherence and physical exercise. The specific content of individual online programs are heterogeneous and hardly comparable.
Objectives:
To use generative artificial intelligence (AI)-based knowledge graphs and network analysis to illustrate and structure mHealth content in order to improve its quality.
Methods:
The content of a previously developed mHealth online program (POCOS) for post-viral fibromyalgia-like syndromes was used for this analysis (24 modules, 22.150 words in total). Animated or video files were excluded. We used ChatGPT4 (OpenAI) and Infranodus (Nodus Labs) with built-in GPT-4 as generative AI web-applications to create knowledge graphs and perform text network analysis.
Results:
ChatGPT-generated knowledge graph provided a visual overview with 5 main edges: ‘Mental health challenges’, ‘stress and its impact’, ‘immune system function’, ‘long covid and fibromyalgia’, ‘pain management and therapeutic approaches’. In the 3-dimensional visualization, the term ‘pain’ had the highest betweenness with ‘sleep’, ‘body’ and ‘stress’. Topical cluster analysis revealed the following categories: chronic pain management, sleep hygiene, immune system function cognitive therapy, healthy eating, emotional development, fibromyalgia causes and deep relaxation. A gap analysis revealed several lacking connections such as between the terms ‘negative behavior’ and ‘systemic inflammation’. Selected Concepts Relation Analysis was performed for several nodes. For example, the node ‘pain’ and ‘covid’ had an influence of 0.48 (19% of total). It was connected to 23 of 150 nodes (15%) in the knowledge graph with a relation to the terms sleep, muscle and breathing.
Conclusion:
Generative AI-tools for text network analysis structure and illustrate DTx content. They can be used to highlight concepts and work on knowledge-synapses and to elucidate gaps in order to improve content.

A salient question in these debates pertains to perceptions of the extent to which creators contribute to the co-produced output. As the current research establishes, the answer to this question depends on the evaluation target. Nine studies (seven preregistered, total N = 4498) document that people evaluate their own contributions to co-produced outputs with ChatGPT as higher than those of others. This systematic self–other difference stems from differential inferences regarding types of GenAI usage behavior: People think that they predominantly use GenAI for inspiration, but others use it to outsource work. These self–other differences in turn have direct ramifications for GenAI acceptability perceptions, such that usage is considered more acceptable for the self than for others. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for science, education, and marketing.},

    abstract = {Background
Recent surveys indicate that 48% of consumers actively use generative artificial intelligence (AI) for health-related inquiries. Despite widespread adoption and the potential to improve health care access, scant research examines the performance of AI chatbot responses regarding emergency care advice.
Objective
We assessed the quality of AI chatbot responses to common emergency care questions. We sought to determine qualitative differences in responses from 4 free-access AI chatbots, for 10 different serious and benign emergency conditions.
Methods
We created 10 emergency care questions that we fed into the free-access versions of ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI), Google Bard, Bing AI Chat (Microsoft), and Claude AI (Anthropic) on November 26, 2023. Each response was graded by 5 board-certified emergency medicine (EM) faculty for 8 domains of percentage accuracy, presence of dangerous information, factual accuracy, clarity, completeness, understandability, source reliability, and source relevancy. We determined the correct, complete response to the 10 questions from reputable and scholarly emergency medical references. These were compiled by an EM resident physician. For the readability of the chatbot responses, we used the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of each response from readability statistics embedded in Microsoft Word. Differences between chatbots were determined by the chi-square test.
Results
Each of the 4 chatbots’ responses to the 10 clinical questions were scored across 8 domains by 5 EM faculty, for 400 assessments for each chatbot. Together, the 4 chatbots had the best performance in clarity and understandability (both 85%), intermediate performance in accuracy and completeness (both 50%), and poor performance (10%) for source relevance and reliability (mostly unreported). Chatbots contained dangerous information in 5% to 35% of responses, with no statistical difference between chatbots on this metric (P=.24). ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Claud AI had similar performances across 6 out of 8 domains. Only Bing AI performed better with more identified or relevant sources (40%; the others had 0%-10%). Flesch-Kincaid Reading level was 7.7-8.9 grade for all chatbots, except ChatGPT at 10.8, which were all too advanced for average emergency patients. Responses included both dangerous (eg, starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation with no pulse check) and generally inappropriate advice (eg, loosening the collar to improve breathing without evidence of airway compromise).
Conclusions
AI chatbots, though ubiquitous, have significant deficiencies in EM patient advice, despite relatively consistent performance. Information for when to seek urgent or emergent care is frequently incomplete and inaccurate, and patients may be unaware of misinformation. Sources are not generally provided. Patients who use AI to guide health care decisions assume potential risks. AI chatbots for health should be subject to further research, refinement, and regulation. We strongly recommend proper medical consultation to prevent potential adverse outcomes.},

While these technological breakthroughs present new possibilities for legal automation, they also raise concerns about over-reliance and automation bias. Drawing insights from the COMPAS case, this paper examines the implications of deploying generative LLMs in the judicial domain. It identifies the persistent factors that contributed to an accountability gap when AI systems were previously used for judicial decision-making. To address these risks, the paper analyses the relevant provisions of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, outlining a comprehensive accountability framework based on the regulation's risk-based approach. The paper concludes that the successful integration of generative LLMs in judicial decision-making requires a holistic approach addressing cognitive biases. By emphasising shared responsibility and the imperative of AI literacy across the AI value chain, the regulatory framework can help mitigate the risks of automation bias and preserve the rule of law.},

    abstract = {The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked debate in education about whether to ban AI tools for assessments. This study explores the adoption and impact of AI tools on an undergraduate research proposal assignment using a mixed-methods approach. From a sample of 187 students, 69 completed a survey, with 46 (67%) reporting the use of AI tools. AI-using students were significantly more likely to be higher-performing, with a pre-semester average GPA of 5.46 compared to 4.92 for non-users (7-point scale, p = .025). Most students used AI assistance for the highest-weighted components of the task, such as the research topic and methods section, using AI primarily for generating research ideas and gathering feedback. Regression analysis suggests that there was no statistically significant effect of AI use on student performance in the task, with the preferred regression specification estimating an effect size of less than 1 mark out of 100. The qualitative analysis identified six main themes of AI usage: idea generation, writing assistance, literature search, grammar checking, statistical analysis, and overall learning impact. These findings indicate that while AI tools are widely adopted, their impact on academic performance is neutral, suggesting a potential for integration into educational practices without compromising academic integrity.},

To this end, a research question was formulated: how can GenAI improve the effective use of CRM systems? Accordingly, a preliminary study based on secondary data analysis as well as software analysis was conducted to identify areas of GenAI use in CRM systems where we see an increase in the effective application of CRM. The results of the analysis showed that GenAI-powered CRM systems support the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing, sales, commerce, service and system user success. This is because they provide numerous advantages in terms of developing, expanding and strengthening customer relationships through highly advanced personalisation, closely linked to customer segmentation, which allows unique experiences to be provided to individual segments.

    abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP), especially in domains where labeled data are scarce or expensive, such as the clinical domain. However, to unlock the clinical knowledge hidden in these LLMs, we need to design effective prompts that can guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and prompt engineering approaches.
Objective
The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of various prompt engineering techniques, including 2 newly introduced types—heuristic and ensemble prompts, for zero-shot and few-shot clinical information extraction using pretrained language models.
Methods
This comprehensive experimental study evaluated different prompt types (simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, anticipatory, heuristic, and ensemble) across 5 clinical NLP tasks: clinical sense disambiguation, biomedical evidence extraction, coreference resolution, medication status extraction, and medication attribute extraction. The performance of these prompts was assessed using 3 state-of-the-art language models: GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and LLaMA-2 (Meta). The study contrasted zero-shot with few-shot prompting and explored the effectiveness of ensemble approaches.
Results
The study revealed that task-specific prompt tailoring is vital for the high performance of LLMs for zero-shot clinical NLP. In clinical sense disambiguation, GPT-3.5 achieved an accuracy of 0.96 with heuristic prompts and 0.94 in biomedical evidence extraction. Heuristic prompts, alongside chain of thought prompts, were highly effective across tasks. Few-shot prompting improved performance in complex scenarios, and ensemble approaches capitalized on multiple prompt strengths. GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed Gemini and LLaMA-2 across tasks and prompt types.
Conclusions
This study provides a rigorous evaluation of prompt engineering methodologies and introduces innovative techniques for clinical information extraction, demonstrating the potential of in-context learning in the clinical domain. These findings offer clear guidelines for future prompt-based clinical NLP research, facilitating engagement by non-NLP experts in clinical NLP advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of generative artificial intelligence, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in this area.},

    abstract = {Knowledge has become more open and accessible to a large audience with the “democratization of information” facilitated by technology. This paper provides a sociohistorical perspective for the theme issue “Responsible Design, Integration, and Use of Generative AI in Mental Health.” It evaluates ethical considerations in using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for the democratization of mental health knowledge and practice. It explores the historical context of democratizing information, transitioning from restricted access to widespread availability due to the internet, open-source movements, and most recently, GenAI technologies such as large language models. The paper highlights why GenAI technologies represent a new phase in the democratization movement, offering unparalleled access to highly advanced technology as well as information. In the realm of mental health, this requires delicate and nuanced ethical deliberation. Including GenAI in mental health may allow, among other things, improved accessibility to mental health care, personalized responses, and conceptual flexibility, and could facilitate a flattening of traditional hierarchies between health care providers and patients. At the same time, it also entails significant risks and challenges that must be carefully addressed. To navigate these complexities, the paper proposes a strategic questionnaire for assessing artificial intelligence–based mental health applications. This tool evaluates both the benefits and the risks, emphasizing the need for a balanced and ethical approach to GenAI integration in mental health. The paper calls for a cautious yet positive approach to GenAI in mental health, advocating for the active engagement of mental health professionals in guiding GenAI development. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring that GenAI advancements are not only technologically sound but also ethically grounded and patient-centered.},

    abstract = {Background
Discrepancies in medical data sets can perpetuate bias, especially when training deep learning models, potentially leading to biased outcomes in clinical applications. Understanding these biases is crucial for the development of equitable healthcare technologies. This study employs generative deep learning technology to explore and understand radiographic differences based on race among patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty.
Methods
Utilizing a large institutional registry, we retrospectively analyzed pelvic radiographs from total hip arthroplasty patients, characterized by demographics and image features. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models generated radiographs conditioned on demographic and imaging characteristics. Fréchet Inception Distance assessed the generated image quality, showing the diversity and realism of the generated images. Sixty transition videos were generated that showed transforming White pelvises to their closest African American counterparts and vice versa while controlling for patients’ sex, age, and body mass index. Two expert surgeons and 2 radiologists carefully studied these videos to understand the systematic differences that are present in the 2 races’ radiographs.
Results
Our data set included 480,407 pelvic radiographs, with a predominance of White patients over African Americans. The generative denoising diffusion probabilistic model created high-quality images and reached an Fréchet Inception Distance of 6.8. Experts identified 6 characteristics differentiating races, including interacetabular distance, osteoarthritis degree, obturator foramina shape, femoral neck-shaft angle, pelvic ring shape, and femoral cortical thickness.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of generative models for understanding disparities in medical imaging data sets. By visualizing race-based differences, this method aids in identifying bias in downstream tasks, fostering the development of fairer healthcare practices.},

    abstract = {In this essay, we characterize three paradoxical imaginaries that structure the development of generative artificial intelligence (genAI). At the institutional level, these technologies develop in a context that celebrates openness and liberality. Yet, both in the US and in Europe, they serve to centralize power and resources. At the organizational level, while the imaginary is that these technologies make work more interesting, we show that they rather produce anxiety and a new class of precarious workers. At the epistemic level, generative artificial intelligence promises access to unlimited knowledge. This knowledge may appear robust, as these technologies become performative. However, the knowledge they produce is doubtful. Overall, these technologies centralize power and exclude, they standardize knowledge, and they produce, reproduce, amplify and extend various structures of domination.},

This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the impact of AI on consumer behavior, focusing on the two pivotal phases of AI development over the past 15 years. We start by reviewing the extensively researched, yet still growing, field of algorithmic predictions and decision-making, alongside the varied positive and negative consumer reactions it elicits. Subsequently, we delve into the just emerging field of GenAI. Here, we differentiate between Convergent Thinking GenAI, which is more domain-specific and geared towards pre-defined task completion, and Divergent Thinking GenAI, which is more domain-general and oriented towards new task fulfillment. For each of these realms, we identify key areas for future investigation.},

    abstract = {The excitement surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) is palpable. It is rapidly gaining prevalence in academia, business, and personal use. In particular, the emergence of generative AI, exemplified by large language models such as ChatGPT, has been marked by substantial media attention, discourse, and hype. Like most, if not all, aspects of business, innovation processes have been impacted. However, little is known about the degree of impact or the benefits that might be gained. To cut through the hype and understand the use of AI in innovation processes in businesses today, a large-scale survey amongst innovation managers in the USA was conducted, followed by interviews. The findings indicate that the use of AI in innovation processes is high and widespread, with AI being used for more than half of the surveyed firms' innovation projects. Furthermore, AI is used more in the development stage of the innovation process than in the idea or commercialization stages, which counters much of the existing discourse, which focuses on the idea stage. We uncover interesting differences by comparing the use and impact of generative AI with that of more traditional AI. Among these is a significant difference in expected benefits in making employees’ jobs more fulfilling — managers believe generative AI is more likely to confer this benefit than traditional AI. This paper offers two valuable contributions. First, it enriches the evolving dialogue at the intersection of AI and innovation management by offering much-needed empirical evidence about practical applications. Second, it provides timely managerial implications by examining relationships between the use of AI and innovation performance and understanding the benefits that AI can confer in the innovation process.},

To this end, 60 relevant records were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus after being filtered according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) model. A content analysis of the articles was then carried out using a detailed form based on the objectives, methodology, results, conclusions, and recommendations model in relation to the current aims. Literacy assessment has been conducted primarily in information literacy. Research in anglophone countries and Spain stands out. Much of it relates to academic libraries as a whole, although there are also numerous studies focused on a field of use, primarily health, STEM, and social sciences. Among the most commonly used methods of analysis, case studies stand out, followed by descriptive, exploratory, experimental, and comparative studies; literature reviews; and content analysis. The results are positive, and assessment helps improve programs and demonstrate libraries' impact on student learning. Despite its importance, media literacy assessment is still an emerging field, and data literacy assessment is still largely a work in progress. Academic libraries need to integrate new types of literacy and emerging challenges such as open data, open science, and generative artificial intelligence into the comprehensive framework of information literacy and conduct a systematic assessment of their training programs and activities.},

    abstract = {Purpose
We compared the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) (Augmented Transformer Assisted Radiology Intelligence [ATARI, Microsoft Nuance, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington]) and natural language processing (NLP) tools for identifying laterality errors in radiology reports and images.
Methods
We used an NLP-based (mPower, Microsoft Nuance) tool to identify radiology reports flagged for laterality errors in its Quality Assurance Dashboard. The NLP model detects and highlights laterality mismatches in radiology reports. From an initial pool of 1,124 radiology reports flagged by the NLP for laterality errors, we selected and evaluated 898 reports that encompassed radiography, CT, MRI, and ultrasound modalities to ensure comprehensive coverage. A radiologist reviewed each radiology report to assess if the flagged laterality errors were present (reporting error—true-positive) or absent (NLP error—false-positive). Next, we applied ATARI to 237 radiology reports and images with consecutive NLP true-positive (118 reports) and false-positive (119 reports) laterality errors. We estimated accuracy of NLP and generative AI tools to identify overall and modality-wise laterality errors.
Results
Among the 898 NLP-flagged laterality errors, 64% (574 of 898) had NLP errors and 36% (324 of 898) were reporting errors. The text query ATARI feature correctly identified the absence of laterality mismatch (NLP false-positives) with a 97.4% accuracy (115 of 118 reports; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 96.5%-98.3%). Combined vision and text query resulted in 98.3% accuracy (116 of 118 reports or images; 95% CI = 97.6%-99.0%), and query alone had a 98.3% accuracy (116 of 118 images; 95% CI = 97.6%-99.0%).
Conclusion
The generative AI-empowered ATARI prototype outperformed the assessed NLP tool for determining true and false laterality errors in radiology reports while enabling an image-based laterality determination. Underlying errors in ATARI text query in complex radiology reports emphasize the need for further improvement in the technology.},

Our paper examines the potential and challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to code student-generated content in online discussions based on intended learning outcomes and how instructors could use this to assess the intended and enacted learning design. If instructors were to rely on LLMs as a means of assessment, the reliability of these models to code the data accurately is crucial. Employing a diverse set of LLMs from the GPT family and prompting techniques on an asynchronous online discussion dataset from a blended-learning bachelor-level course, our research examines the reliability of AI-supported coding in educational research. Findings reveal that while AI-supported coding demonstrates efficiency, achieving substantial, moderate agreement with human coding for specific nuanced and context-dependent codes is challenging. Moreover, the high cost, token limits, and the advanced necessary skills needed to write API scripts might limit the usability of AI-driven coding. Finally, implementation would require specific parameterization techniques based on the class and may not be feasible for widespread implementation. Our study underscores the importance of transparency in AI coding methodologies and the need for a hybrid approach that integrates human judgement to ensure data accuracy and interpretability. In addition, it contributes to the knowledge base about the reliability of LLMs to code real, small datasets using complex codes that are common in the instructor's practice and explores the potential and challenges of using these models for assessment purposes.},

    abstract = {Background
Brief message interventions have demonstrated immense promise in health care, yet the development of these messages has suffered from a dearth of transparency and a scarcity of publicly accessible data sets. Moreover, the researcher-driven content creation process has raised resource allocation issues, necessitating a more efficient and transparent approach to content development.
Objective
This research sets out to address the challenges of content development for SMS interventions by showcasing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for content creation, transparently explaining the prompt design and content generation process, and providing the largest publicly available data set of brief messages and source code for future replication of our process.
Methods
Leveraging the pretrained large language model GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), we generate a collection of messages in the context of medication adherence for individuals with type 2 diabetes using evidence-derived behavior change techniques identified in a prior systematic review. We create an attributed prompt designed to adhere to content (readability and tone) and SMS (character count and encoder type) standards while encouraging message variability to reflect differences in behavior change techniques.
Results
We deliver the most extensive repository of brief messages for a singular health care intervention and the first library of messages crafted with generative AI. In total, our method yields a data set comprising 1150 messages, with 89.91% (n=1034) meeting character length requirements and 80.7% (n=928) meeting readability requirements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that all messages exhibit diversity comparable to an existing publicly available data set created under the same theoretical framework for a similar setting.
Conclusions
This research provides a novel approach to content creation for health care interventions using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. Future research is needed to assess the generated content for ethical, safety, and research standards, as well as to determine whether the intervention is successful in improving the target behaviors.},

    abstract = {Background and objective
Generative artificial intelligence models are among the most promising and widely used tools used in health care. This review investigates GPT-4 answers to decision-making questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis across several clinical settings and their correspondence to the current European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.
Methods
In March 2024, the GPT-4 model was asked 11 questions, containing a brief description of a patient with urolithiasis. All questions were grouped according to urolithiasis care step: diagnosis, urgent care, scheduled intervention, and metaphylaxis. When responses were received, compliance with the current EAU guidelines was assessed by experienced urologists.
Key findings and limitations
Although all responses were provided with information that corresponded to EAU guidelines, six of the 11 answers were associated with missed guideline–provided parts, and incorrect data were given in eight of the 11 answers. GPT-4 is relatively safe in the initial diagnostic flow of patients suspected of having stones within the urinary tract and during treatment planning; however, its understanding of all the nuances of metaphylaxis leaves much to be desired and is far from the dogma given in the EAU guidelines. Moreover, GPT-4 knowledge of strategy and algorithm is not always aligned with the EAU guidelines.
Conclusions and clinical implications
Despite the fact that from the perspective of patients with urolithiasis, GPT-4 is capable of answering their questions well, the specificity of questions from urologists is labor intensive for its current version, and necessitates the ability to interpret it correctly and further attempts to improve it. While some aspects of diagnostics are more accurate, these struggle with surgical planning and algorithms in line with the EAU guidelines.
Patient summary
The generative artificial intelligence (AI) model GPT-4 is capable of answering urology-related questions, but lacks detailed responses. Although some aspects of the diagnostics are accurate, knowledge of surgical planning is not in line with the European Association of Urology guidelines. Future improvements should focus on efforts to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and clinical relevance of AI tools in urology.},

The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models including OpenAI's ChatGPT signals a promising era for medical research. In this Viewpoint, we explore the integration and challenges of large language models (LLMs) in digital pathology, a rapidly evolving domain demanding intricate contextual understanding. The restricted domain-specific efficiency of LLMs necessitates the advent of tailored AI tools, as illustrated by advancements seen in the last few years including FrugalGPT and BioBERT. Our initiative in digital pathology emphasises the potential of domain-specific AI tools, where a curated literature database coupled with a user-interactive web application facilitates precise, referenced information retrieval. Motivated by the success of this initiative, we discuss how domain-specific approaches substantially minimise the risk of inaccurate responses, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of information extraction. We also highlight the broader implications of such tools, particularly in streamlining access to scientific research and democratising access to computational pathology techniques for scientists with little coding experience. This Viewpoint calls for an enhanced integration of domain-specific text-generation AI tools in academic settings to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation to the dynamically evolving landscape of medical research.},

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offers increased accessibility and personalized learning, though the potential for inaccuracies, biases, and unethical use is concerning. We present a newly developed research paper assignment that required students to utilize GAI. The assignment was implemented within three online, asynchronous graduate courses for medical laboratory sciences. Student learning was assessed using a rubric, which rated students’ effective integration and evaluation of GAI-generated content against peer-reviewed research articles, thus demonstrating their critical thinking and synthesis skills, among other metrics. Overall rubric scores were high, suggesting that learning outcomes were met. After field testing, we administered a 16-item survey about GAI utilization, contribution to learning, and ethical concerns. Data (n = 32) were analyzed, and free-response answers were thematically coded. While 93.8% of respondents found the GAI-generated content to be “very good” or “excellent,” 28.1% found inaccuracies, and 68.8% “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that GAI should be allowed to be used as a tool to complete academic assignments. Interestingly, however, only 28.1% “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that GAI may be used for assignments if not explicitly authorized by the instructor. Though GAI allowed for more efficient completion of the project and better understanding of the topic, students noted concerns about academic integrity and the lack of citations in GAI responses. The assignment can easily be modified for different learning preferences and course environments. Raising awareness among students and faculty about the ethical use and limitations of GAI is crucial in today’s evolving pedagogical landscape.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become prominent in healthcare, particularly as an oncology aid in clinical documentation, which has implications for treatment decisions.1 National guidelines favor synoptic reporting of prostate biopsy specimens to aid in proper risk stratification of prostate cancer (PCa).2;Thus, AI is a potential tool to analyze synoptic reports and reduce the variation in algorithmic risk stratification. We questioned whether a trained AI model could review pathology reports, along with clinical vignettes, for PCa to provide an accurate risk assessment and recommendations.1. Sorin, V, Barash, Y, Konin, E., et al.. Deep-learning natural language processing for oncological applications. The Lancet Oncology. 2020 Dec 2020;21(12)doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(20)30615-X2. https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/prostate_blocks.pdf
Methods
Retrospective review of localized PCa patients from January 2022 – January 2023 was performed. Following initial prostate biopsy, all patients were consulted and risk stratified based on NCCN guidelines by a urologic oncologist. We provided a generative AI model, ChatGPT3, the PCa risk stratification algorithm from NCCN Version 1.2023. Then queried the model to ensure accurate recall of the algorithm rules. Clinical features (PSA, cT stage) and histologic features (synoptic path report) from each case were provided and the model was prompted to “risk stratify the following patient.” In addition, we requested additional evaluation (ex: imaging) and initial therapy recommendations were also queried. 10 patients from each NCCN risk category were reviewed.3. ChatGPT. https://chat.openai.com
Results
60 patients were reviewed. The generative AI model correctly risk stratified 39/60 patients (65.0%). The AI model incorrectly risk stratified 21/60 patients, however, it did assign them to an adjacent risk group (Figure 1).; Notably, 14/20 patients were correctly assigned as intermediate risk group, but the model required further prompting for categorization into favorable or unfavorable risk. Once prompted, only 12/20 were correctly risk stratified (Figure 1). Finally, when queried, the model was able to recommend treatment and imaging modalities appropriate to the stated risk group (ex: very low risk favor active surveillance, and high risk required imaging).
Conclusions
Generative AI demonstrated poor performance in algorithmic risk stratification using standardized synoptic reports. The implications of inaccurate assessments need to be considered as more healthcare professionals and systems look to incorporating generative AI into clinical tools. A healthy amount of skepticism and close review is needed to vet any clinical tool. Ultimately when it comes to the nuance of the PCa, a trained provider is still needed to interpret the information and recommendations in line with the patient's goals and preferences.},

    abstract = {Abstract ID 126248 Poster Board 224 Purpose: The objective of this study is to establish the accuracy of generative artificial intelligence (AI) when scoring medical student exam questions in an open-ended format (OEQ) compared to a faculty content expert. Background: Despite the numerous benefits to including OEQs in assessment of medical knowledge1,2, only 39% of US allopathic medical schools use them3. Faculty report that the biggest barrier is the time it takes to grade student responses1,2. Natural language processing has been explored to automate scoring of clinical reasoning4, but no study has evaluated the use of generative AI to score OEQ responses in the pre-clerkship curriculum. Methods: OEQ responses from two questions administered at the Zucker School of Medicine (ZSOM) and the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine (UCSF) were used for the current study5. Responses from 54 students per site were analyzed. Content experts scored the responses using an analytic (ZSOM) or holistic rubric (UCSF). Questions, rubrics, and student responses were fed into the GPT-4 model via the Med2Lab platform. Once finalized, scores for each student’s response were generated. Cohen’s weighted kappa (kw) was used to evaluate inter-rater reliability (IRR) between the content expert and generative AI scores, with kw scores between 0.60 and 0.80 being considered substantial6. Prompt engineering was employed for question 1 (analytic rubric) to evaluate its impact on IRR. Results: IRR between the content expert and generative AI scores was substantial using the analytic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.71; question 2: kw = 0.63) and the holistic rubric (question 1: kw = 0.66; question 2: kw = 0.68). IRR for question 1 (analytic rubric) was initially kw = 0.61 but was increased to kw = 0.71 after adjustments with prompt engineering and re-run in GPT-4. Conclusions: Generative AI can score OEQs with substantial reliability. With the potential to alleviate grading burden, AI scoring will allow medical schools to broadly implement OEQs for assessment.},

    abstract = {Background
Resident training programs in the US use the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) to assess the current knowledge of their residents and to identify the residents at risk of failing the Amerian Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) examination. Optimal strategies for OITE preparation are constantly being explored. There may be a role for Large Language Models (LLMs) in orthopaedic resident education. ChatGPT, an LLM launched in late 2022 has demonstrated the ability to produce accurate, detailed answers, potentially enabling it to aid in medical education and clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on Orthopaedic In-Training Examinations using Self-Assessment Exams from the AAOS database and approved literature as a proxy for the Orthopaedic Board Examination.
Methods
301 SAE questions from the AAOS database and associated AAOS literature were input into ChatGPT's interface in a question and multiple-choice format and the answers were then analyzed to determine which answer choice was selected. A new chat was used for every question. All answers were recorded, categorized, and compared to the answer given by the OITE and SAE exams, noting whether the answer was right or wrong.
Results
Of the 301 questions asked, ChatGPT was able to correctly answer 183 (60.8%) of them. The subjects with the highest percentage of correct questions were basic science (81%), oncology (72.7%, shoulder and elbow (71.9%), and sports (71.4%). The questions were further subdivided into 3 groups: those about management, diagnosis, or knowledge recall. There were 86 management questions and 47 were correct (54.7%), 45 diagnosis questions with 32 correct (71.7%), and 168 knowledge recall questions with 102 correct (60.7%).
Conclusions
ChatGPT has the potential to provide orthopedic educators and trainees with accurate clinical conclusions for the majority of board-style questions, although its reasoning should be carefully analyzed for accuracy and clinical validity. As such, its usefulness in a clinical educational context is currently limited but rapidly evolving.
Clinical relevance
ChatGPT can access a multitude of medical data and may help provide accurate answers to clinical questions.},

However, AI has facilitated the spread of misinformation, emphasizing the importance of taking a balanced approach that considers both the technology's positive applications and its ethical risks. This paper looks at the intersection of AI and social media. The researchers use a mixed-method approach to analyze 1540 scholarly documents, combining bibliometric and systematic literature review techniques. The goal of this research is to identify the most important topics and trends, as well as potential business values and implications, in the AI Social Media domain. The first stage of the research involved a quantitative keyword co-occurrence analysis, which resulted in the identification of ten dominant themes. These include Conversational Agents & User Experience, Human Emotion and Content Recommendation & Moderation, Collective Intelligence in Emergency Management, Algorithmic Activism on social media, Deep Fakes and Fake News, Generative Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmic Bias in Content Moderation Systems, Deep Sentiment Analysis, Metaverse Technologies, and NLP & Mental Health Detection. Each identified theme is then subjected to a qualitative thematic literature review, which provides a more in-depth, context-specific understanding of the associated findings. Because of this comprehensive approach, the study provides a broad overview of the current state of AI social media, shedding light on the potential applications and far-reaching implications of this interdisciplinary nexus. The study's findings have the potential to shape strategic decision-making, policy development, and future research directions in this rapidly changing field.},

    abstract = {University students often employ generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT in resolution of ill-defined problem-solving tasks. However, the experimental evidence about effects of ChatGPT on complex problem-solving performance is still missing. In this preregistered experiment, the impact of ChatGPT on performance in a complex creative problem-solving task was investigated in 77 university students solving a task with ChatGPT in comparison to 68 students solving a task without it. ChatGPT use significantly improved self-efficacy for task resolution (d = 0.65) and enhanced the quality (d = 0.69), elaboration (d = 0.61), and originality (d = 0.55) of solutions. Moreover, participants with ChatGPT assistance perceived task as easier (d = 0.56) and requiring less mental effort (d = 0.58). However, use of ChatGPT did not make task resolution more interesting (d = 0.08), and the impact of ChatGPT on metacognitive monitoring accuracy was unclear. Although there were no significant differences in absolute accuracy between students solving the task with and without the assistance of ChatGPT, the absence of correlation between self-evaluation judgments and performance suggests that participants struggled to calibrate their self-evaluations when using ChatGPT. Notably, the perceived usefulness of ChatGPT appeared to inform self-evaluation judgments, resulting in higher inaccuracy. The implications for hybrid human-AI regulation (HHAIR) theory are discussed. To regulate effectively, students using AI tools should focus on valid metacognitive cues instead of the perceived ease of ChatGPT-assisted problem-solving.},

Therefore, we use a mixed-methods design to combine findings from a quantitative survey study and a qualitative interview study. In Study 1, we follow a configurational approach to analyze multi-wave data from 279 participants with fsQCA. We identify five configurations that lead to high continuance intention and show that perceived ease of use and perceived novelty are necessary for this outcome. Interestingly, the observed factors together cannot explain low continuance intention. In Study 2, we complement these findings with insights based on 15 semi-structured interviews. We illustrate the configurations by identifying 27 individual use cases in the private and work contexts as well as additional factors that facilitate and hinder individual ChatGPT continuance intention. We draw meta-inferences by combining findings of both studies to develop five propositions.

The objective of this study was to compare generative artificial intelligence–initiated care pathways, using ChatGPT, with expert-guided consensus-initiated care pathways from AskMayoExpert (AME) for symptom management of esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy.
Methods
A formal protocol for development of 9 AME care pathways was followed for specific patient-identified domains after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Domain scores were measured and assessed through the Upper Digestive Disease tool. These care pathways were developed by experts validated by a consensus-driven methodology. ChatGPT was used to answer specific questions similar to the AME care pathway on April 9, 2023, and March 28, 2024. To compare outcomes, answers were recorded, and algorithms were compared with a survey tool composed of 5 questions.
Results
Both modalities were able to provide a clear definition with multidirectional management options for all 9 domains: dysphagia, generalized dumping, gastrointestinal dumping, pain, regurgitation, heartburn, nausea, physical health, and mental health. When provided with a simple prompt, ChatGPT 3.5 failed to provide a comprehensive stepwise approach for providers, any testing recommendations, or any form of triage process. However, ChatGPT 4.0 provided plans, similar to AME care pathways, when a sophisticated prompt was used.
Conclusions
Generative artificial intelligence–initiated care pathways can be used by physicians as a supplementary tool to guide provider management of patients with complex symptoms after esophagectomy. This technology will continue to advance but is currently insufficient to solely guide clinical management of complex patients with severe symptoms.},

Many individuals use the Internet, including generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT, for sleep-related information before consulting medical professionals. This study compared responses from sleep disorder specialists and ChatGPT to common sleep queries, with experts and laypersons evaluating the responses' accuracy and clarity.
Methods
We assessed responses from sleep medicine specialists and ChatGPT-4 to 140 sleep-related questions from the Korean Sleep Research Society's website. In a blinded study design, sleep disorder experts and laypersons rated the medical helpfulness, emotional supportiveness, and sentence comprehensibility of the responses on a 1-5 scale.
Results
Laypersons rated ChatGPT higher for medical helpfulness (3.79 ± 0.90 vs. 3.44 ± 0.99, p < .001), emotional supportiveness (3.48 ± 0.79 vs. 3.12 ± 0.98, p < .001), and sentence comprehensibility (4.24 ± 0.79 vs. 4.14 ± 0.96, p = .028). Experts also rated ChatGPT higher for emotional supportiveness (3.33 ± 0.62 vs. 3.01 ± 0.67, p < .001) but preferred specialists' responses for sentence comprehensibility (4.15 ± 0.74 vs. 3.94 ± 0.90, p < .001). When it comes to medical helpfulness, the experts rated the specialists' answers slightly higher than the laypersons did (3.70 ± 0.84 vs. 3.63 ± 0.87, p = .109). Experts slightly preferred specialist responses overall (56.0%), while laypersons favored ChatGPT (54.3%; p < .001). ChatGPT's responses were significantly longer (186.76 ± 39.04 vs. 113.16 ± 95.77 words, p < .001).
Discussion
Generative artificial intelligence like ChatGPT may help disseminate sleep-related medical information online. Laypersons appear to prefer ChatGPT's detailed, emotionally supportive responses over those from sleep disorder specialists.},

ChatGPT is a conversational chatbot that uses machine learning algorithms to enhance its replies based on user interactions and is a part of a broader effort to develop natural language processing that can assist people in their daily lives by understanding and responding to human language in a useful and engaging way. Thus far, many potential applications within healthcare have been described, despite its relatively recent release. This manuscript offers the pediatric surgical community a primer on this new technology and discusses some initial observations about its potential uses and pitfalls. Moreover, it introduces the perspectives of medical journals and surgical societies regarding the use of this artificial intelligence chatbot. As ChatGPT and other large language models continue to evolve, it is the responsibility of the pediatric surgery community to stay abreast of these changes and play an active role in safely incorporating them into our field for the benefit of our patients.

    abstract = {Synthetic visual art is becoming a commodity due to generative artificial intelligence (AI). The trend of using AI for co-creation will not spare artists’ creative processes, and it is important to understand how the use of generative AI at different stages of the creative process affects both the evaluation of the artist and the result of the human-machine collaboration (i.e., the visual artifact). In three experiments (N = 560), this research explores how the evaluation of artworks is transformed by the revelation that the artist collaborated with AI at different stages of the creative process. The results show that co-created art is less liked and recognized, especially when AI was used in the implementation stage. While co-created art is perceived as more novel, it lacks creative authenticity, which exerts a dominant influence. The results also show that artists’ perceptions suffer from the co-creation process, and that artists who co-create are less admired because they are perceived as less authentic. Two boundary conditions are identified. The negative effect can be mitigated by disclosing the level of artist involvement in co-creation with AI (e.g., by training the algorithm on a curated set of images vs. simply prompting an off-the-shelf AI image generator). In the context of art that is perceived as commercially motivated (e.g., stock images), the effect is also diminished. This research has important implications for the literature on human-AI-collaboration, research on authenticity, and the ongoing policy debate regarding the transparency of algorithmic presence.},

    abstract = {Background
The use of mobile devices for delivering health-related services (mobile health [mHealth]) has rapidly increased, leading to a demand for summarizing the state of the art and practice through systematic reviews. However, the systematic review process is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution to automate tedious tasks.
Objective
This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools.
Methods
We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews.
Results
A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps. This approach could be particularly useful for researchers with limited coding skills. However, the study has limitations related to the design science research methodology, subjectivity bias, and the quality of the search results used to train the language model.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the form of large language models, has rapidly developed. The LLaMA series are popular and recently updated from LLaMA2 to LLaMA3. However, the impacts of the update on diagnostic performance have not been well documented.
Objective
We conducted a comparative evaluation of the diagnostic performance in differential diagnosis lists generated by LLaMA3 and LLaMA2 for case reports.
Methods
We analyzed case reports published in the American Journal of Case Reports from 2022 to 2023. After excluding nondiagnostic and pediatric cases, we input the remaining cases into LLaMA3 and LLaMA2 using the same prompt and the same adjustable parameters. Diagnostic performance was defined by whether the differential diagnosis lists included the final diagnosis. Multiple physicians independently evaluated whether the final diagnosis was included in the top 10 differentials generated by LLaMA3 and LLaMA2.
Results
In our comparative evaluation of the diagnostic performance between LLaMA3 and LLaMA2, we analyzed differential diagnosis lists for 392 case reports. The final diagnosis was included in the top 10 differentials generated by LLaMA3 in 79.6% (312/392) of the cases, compared to 49.7% (195/392) for LLaMA2, indicating a statistically significant improvement (P<.001). Additionally, LLaMA3 showed higher performance in including the final diagnosis in the top 5 differentials, observed in 63% (247/392) of cases, compared to LLaMA2’s 38% (149/392, P<.001). Furthermore, the top diagnosis was accurately identified by LLaMA3 in 33.9% (133/392) of cases, significantly higher than the 22.7% (89/392) achieved by LLaMA2 (P<.001). The analysis across various medical specialties revealed variations in diagnostic performance with LLaMA3 consistently outperforming LLaMA2.
Conclusions
The results reveal that the LLaMA3 model significantly outperforms LLaMA2 per diagnostic performance, with a higher percentage of case reports having the final diagnosis listed within the top 10, top 5, and as the top diagnosis. Overall diagnostic performance improved almost 1.5 times from LLaMA2 to LLaMA3. These findings support the rapid development and continuous refinement of generative AI systems to enhance diagnostic processes in medicine. However, these findings should be carefully interpreted for clinical application, as generative AI, including the LLaMA series, has not been approved for medical applications such as AI-enhanced diagnostics.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) systems by Google have recently been updated from Bard to Gemini and Gemini Advanced as of December 2023. Gemini is a basic, free-to-use model after a user’s login, while Gemini Advanced operates on a more advanced model requiring a fee-based subscription. These systems have the potential to enhance medical diagnostics. However, the impact of these updates on comprehensive diagnostic accuracy remains unknown.
Objective
This study aimed to compare the accuracy of the differential diagnosis lists generated by Gemini Advanced, Gemini, and Bard across comprehensive medical fields using case report series.
Methods
We identified a case report series with relevant final diagnoses published in the American Journal Case Reports from January 2022 to March 2023. After excluding nondiagnostic cases and patients aged 10 years and younger, we included the remaining case reports. After refining the case parts as case descriptions, we input the same case descriptions into Gemini Advanced, Gemini, and Bard to generate the top 10 differential diagnosis lists. In total, 2 expert physicians independently evaluated whether the final diagnosis was included in the lists and its ranking. Any discrepancies were resolved by another expert physician. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the P values for the number of comparisons among 3 GAI systems, setting the corrected significance level at P value <.02.
Results
In total, 392 case reports were included. The inclusion rates of the final diagnosis within the top 10 differential diagnosis lists were 73% (286/392) for Gemini Advanced, 76.5% (300/392) for Gemini, and 68.6% (269/392) for Bard. The top diagnoses matched the final diagnoses in 31.6% (124/392) for Gemini Advanced, 42.6% (167/392) for Gemini, and 31.4% (123/392) for Bard. Gemini demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy than Bard both within the top 10 differential diagnosis lists (P=.02) and as the top diagnosis (P=.001). In addition, Gemini Advanced achieved significantly lower accuracy than Gemini in identifying the most probable diagnosis (P=.002).
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that Gemini outperformed Bard in diagnostic accuracy following the model update. However, Gemini Advanced requires further refinement to optimize its performance for future artificial intelligence–enhanced diagnostics. These findings should be interpreted cautiously and considered primarily for research purposes, as these GAI systems have not been adjusted for medical diagnostics nor approved for clinical use.},

    abstract = {Background
The release of ChatGPT for general use in 2023 by OpenAI has significantly expanded the possible applications of generative artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector, particularly in terms of information retrieval by patients, medical and nursing students, and healthcare personnel.
Objective
To compare the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0 to clinical nurses on answering questions about tracheostomy care, as well as to determine whether using different prompts to pre-define the scope of the ChatGPT affects the accuracy of their responses.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
The data collected from the ChatGPT was collected using the ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0 using access provided by the University of Hong Kong. The data from the clinical nurses working in mainland China was collected using the Qualtrics survey program.
Participants
No participants were needed for collecting the ChatGPT responses. A total of 272 clinical nurses, with 98.5 % of them working in tertiary care hospitals in mainland China, were recruited using a snowball sampling approach.
Method
We used 43 tracheostomy care-related questions in a multiple-choice format to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and clinical nurses. ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4.0 were both queried three times with the same questions by different prompts: no prompt, patient-friendly prompt, and act-as-nurse prompt. All responses were independently graded by two qualified otorhinolaryngology nurses on a 3-point accuracy scale (correct, partially correct, and incorrect). The Chi-squared test and Fisher exact test with post-hoc Bonferroni adjustment were used to assess the differences in performance between the three groups, as well as the differences in accuracy between different prompts.
Results
ChatGPT-4.0 showed significantly higher accuracy, with 64.3 % of responses rated as ‘correct’, compared to 60.5 % in ChatGPT-3.5 and 36.7 % in clinical nurses (X 2 = 74.192, p < .001). Except for the ‘care for the tracheostomy stoma and surrounding skin’ domain (X2 = 6.227, p = .156), scores from ChatGPT-3.5 and -4.0 were significantly better than nurses’ on domains related to airway humidification, cuff management, tracheostomy tube care, suction techniques, and management of complications. Overall, ChatGPT-4.0 consistently performed well in all domains, achieving over 50 % accuracy in each domain. Alterations to the prompt had no impact on the performance of ChatGPT-3.5 or -4.0.
Conclusion
ChatGPT may serve as a complementary medical information tool for patients and physicians to improve knowledge in tracheostomy care.
Tweetable abstract
ChatGPT-4.0 can answer tracheostomy care questions better than most clinical nurses. There is no reason nurses should not be using it.},

    abstract = {Background
Qualitative methods are incredibly beneficial to the dissemination and implementation of new digital health interventions; however, these methods can be time intensive and slow down dissemination when timely knowledge from the data sources is needed in ever-changing health systems. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and their underlying large language models (LLMs) may provide a promising opportunity to expedite the qualitative analysis of textual data, but their efficacy and reliability remain unknown.
Objective
The primary objectives of our study were to evaluate the consistency in themes, reliability of coding, and time needed for inductive and deductive thematic analyses between GenAI (ie, ChatGPT and Bard) and human coders.
Methods
The qualitative data for this study consisted of 40 brief SMS text message reminder prompts used in a digital health intervention for promoting antiretroviral medication adherence among people with HIV who use methamphetamine. Inductive and deductive thematic analyses of these SMS text messages were conducted by 2 independent teams of human coders. An independent human analyst conducted analyses following both approaches using ChatGPT and Bard. The consistency in themes (or the extent to which the themes were the same) and reliability (or agreement in coding of themes) between methods were compared.
Results
The themes generated by GenAI (both ChatGPT and Bard) were consistent with 71% (5/7) of the themes identified by human analysts following inductive thematic analysis. The consistency in themes was lower between humans and GenAI following a deductive thematic analysis procedure (ChatGPT: 6/12, 50%; Bard: 7/12, 58%). The percentage agreement (or intercoder reliability) for these congruent themes between human coders and GenAI ranged from fair to moderate (ChatGPT, inductive: 31/66, 47%; ChatGPT, deductive: 22/59, 37%; Bard, inductive: 20/54, 37%; Bard, deductive: 21/58, 36%). In general, ChatGPT and Bard performed similarly to each other across both types of qualitative analyses in terms of consistency of themes (inductive: 6/6, 100%; deductive: 5/6, 83%) and reliability of coding (inductive: 23/62, 37%; deductive: 22/47, 47%). On average, GenAI required significantly less overall time than human coders when conducting qualitative analysis (20, SD 3.5 min vs 567, SD 106.5 min).
Conclusions
The promising consistency in the themes generated by human coders and GenAI suggests that these technologies hold promise in reducing the resource intensiveness of qualitative thematic analysis; however, the relatively lower reliability in coding between them suggests that hybrid approaches are necessary. Human coders appeared to be better than GenAI at identifying nuanced and interpretative themes. Future studies should consider how these powerful technologies can be best used in collaboration with human coders to improve the efficiency of qualitative research in hybrid approaches while also mitigating potential ethical risks that they may pose.},

Our study addressed this need by 1) conceptualising Critical GAI Literacy based on current research and our collected data, and 2) developing a self-regulated learning-based micro-curriculum for L2 doctoral students to cultivate knowledge and skills using GAI for academic writing. We collected interactive and reflective data in an introductory-level academic writing course at a Swedish university enrolled with 60 PhD students from diverse backgrounds and examined their evolving perspectives and strategies for engaging in GAI-mediated writing. Findings show a spectrum of initial attitudes among students and limited knowledge of GAI use. Final reflections illustrate de-enchantment with GAI, recalibrated and enhanced understanding of ethical issues, developed prompting methods, and increased awareness of text ownership through the self-directed learning process. Furthermore, students demonstrated a discerning approach in evaluating GAI-generated suggestions and sociolinguistic impacts, indicating a growing criticality in L2 writing practices.},

But when given the choice to use the assistants or not, most declined. Generative AI at this stage is unreliable, and many students found the tradeoff in reviewing AI suggestions to be too time consuming.

The objectives of this study were to analyze the current state of generative AI in health care, identify opportunities and privacy and security challenges posed by integrating these technologies into existing health care infrastructure, and propose strategies for mitigating security and privacy risks. This study highlights the importance of addressing the security and privacy threats associated with generative AI in health care to ensure the safe and effective use of these systems. The findings of this study can inform the development of future generative AI systems in health care and help health care organizations better understand the potential benefits and risks associated with these systems. By examining the use cases and benefits of generative AI across diverse domains within health care, this paper contributes to theoretical discussions surrounding AI ethics, security vulnerabilities, and data privacy regulations. In addition, this study provides practical insights for stakeholders looking to adopt generative AI solutions within their organizations.},

@article{CHEN2024100531,
    abstract = {Objective
Training data fuel and shape the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models. Intensive data requirements are a major bottleneck limiting the success of AI tools in sectors with inherently scarce data. In health care, training data are difficult to curate, triggering growing concerns that the current lack of access to health care by under-privileged social groups will translate into future bias in health care AIs. In this report, we developed an autoencoder to grow and enhance inherently scarce datasets to alleviate our dependence on big data.
Design
Computational study with open-source data.
Subjects
The data were obtained from 6 open-source datasets comprising patients aged 40–80 years in Singapore, China, India, and Spain.
Methods
The reported framework generates synthetic images based on real-world patient imaging data. As a test case, we used autoencoder to expand publicly available training sets of optic disc photos, and evaluated the ability of the resultant datasets to train AI models in the detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
Main Outcome Measures
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the glaucoma detector. A higher AUC indicates better detection performance.
Results
Results show that enhancing datasets with synthetic images generated by autoencoder led to superior training sets that improved the performance of AI models.
Conclusions
Our findings here help address the increasingly untenable data volume and quality requirements for AI model development and have implications beyond health care, toward empowering AI adoption for all similarly data-challenged fields.

    abstract = {Purpose
Patient information videos are excellent for conveying information on eye health. Language barriers lead to inaccessibility for ethnic minorities. So far, overcoming language barriers have been very expensive, but in this short communications paper, we share our experiences with an inexpensive generative artificial intelligence-based translation system for videos.
Design
Explorative study.
Methods
We developed a patient information video on a very common and broadly relevant issue: how to use eye drops. The original video was made in Danish. We used HeyGen (HeyGen, Los Angeles, California, USA) to translate the video into three categories according to distance from Danish according to comparative linguistics: highly related (English and German), remotely related (French and Polish), and no recognizable relationship (Arabic and Turkish). Ophthalmologists with high proficiency in Danish and each of these languages evaluated and commented on the accuracy of the translations.
Results
All translations resulted in a recognizable clone of the original individual with synchronized lip movements and understandable language. We observed certain inaccuracies in the translation, however, these differed across languages without a specific pattern. Inconsistencies in formal/informal pronouns were observed across languages. But overall, the general information was conveyed across all languages.
Conclusion
Modern generative artificial intelligence-based translation tools can help tearing down language barriers and improve accessibility of patient information videos in ophthalmology.},

    abstract = {The integration of generative artificial intelligence technology into research environments has become increasingly common in recent years, representing a significant shift in the way researchers approach their work. This paper seeks to explore the factors underlying the frequency of use of generative AI amongst researchers in their professional environments. As survey data may be influenced by a bias towards scientists interested in AI, potentially skewing the results towards the perspectives of these researchers, this study uses a regression model to isolate the impact of specific factors such as gender, career stage, type of workplace, and perceived barriers to using AI technology on the frequency of use of generative AI. It also controls for other relevant variables such as direct involvement in AI research or development, collaboration with AI companies, geographic location, and scientific discipline. Our results show that researchers who face barriers to AI adoption experience an 11 % increase in tool use, while those who cite insufficient training resources experience an 8 % decrease. Female researchers experience a 7 % decrease in AI tool usage compared to men, while advanced career researchers experience a significant 19 % decrease. Researchers associated with government advisory groups are 45 % more likely to use AI tools frequently than those in government roles. Researchers in for-profit companies show an increase of 19 %, while those in medical research institutions and hospitals show an increase of 16 % and 15 %, respectively. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the use of generative AI tools amongst researchers, with valuable implications for both academia and industry.},

    abstract = {Patients’ online record access (ORA) is growing worldwide. In some countries, including the United States and Sweden, access is advanced with patients obtaining rapid access to their full records on the web including laboratory and test results, lists of prescribed medications, vaccinations, and even the very narrative reports written by clinicians (the latter, commonly referred to as “open notes”). In the United States, patient’s ORA is also available in a downloadable form for use with other apps. While survey studies have shown that some patients report many benefits from ORA, there remain challenges with implementation around writing clinical documentation that patients may now read. With ORA, the functionality of the record is evolving; it is no longer only an aide memoire for doctors but also a communication tool for patients. Studies suggest that clinicians are changing how they write documentation, inviting worries about accuracy and completeness. Other concerns include work burdens; while few objective studies have examined the impact of ORA on workload, some research suggests that clinicians are spending more time writing notes and answering queries related to patients’ records. Aimed at addressing some of these concerns, clinician and patient education strategies have been proposed. In this viewpoint paper, we explore these approaches and suggest another longer-term strategy: the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinicians in documenting narrative summaries that patients will find easier to understand. Applied to narrative clinical documentation, we suggest that such approaches may significantly help preserve the accuracy of notes, strengthen writing clarity and signals of empathy and patient-centered care, and serve as a buffer against documentation work burdens. However, we also consider the current risks associated with existing generative AI. We emphasize that for this innovation to play a key role in ORA, the cocreation of clinical notes will be imperative. We also caution that clinicians will need to be supported in how to work alongside generative AI to optimize its considerable potential.},

    abstract = {Study objective
The workload of clinical documentation contributes to health care costs and professional burnout. The advent of generative artificial intelligence language models presents a promising solution. The perspective of clinicians may contribute to effective and responsible implementation of such tools. This study sought to evaluate 3 uses for generative artificial intelligence for clinical documentation in pediatric emergency medicine, measuring time savings, effort reduction, and physician attitudes and identifying potential risks and barriers.
Methods
This mixed-methods study was performed with 10 pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians from a single pediatric emergency department. Participants were asked to write a supervisory note for 4 clinical scenarios, with varying levels of complexity, twice without any assistance and twice with the assistance of ChatGPT Version 4.0. Participants evaluated 2 additional ChatGPT-generated clinical summaries: a structured handoff and a visit summary for a family written at an 8th grade reading level. Finally, a semistructured interview was performed to assess physicians’ perspective on the use of ChatGPT in pediatric emergency medicine. Main outcomes and measures included between subjects’ comparisons of the effort and time taken to complete the supervisory note with and without ChatGPT assistance. Effort was measured using a self-reported Likert scale of 0 to 10. Physicians’ scoring of and attitude toward the ChatGPT-generated summaries were measured using a 0 to 10 Likert scale and open-ended questions. Summaries were scored for completeness, accuracy, efficiency, readability, and overall satisfaction. A thematic analysis was performed to analyze the content of the open-ended questions and to identify key themes.
Results
ChatGPT yielded a 40% reduction in time and a 33% decrease in effort for supervisory notes in intricate cases, with no discernible effect on simpler notes. ChatGPT-generated summaries for structured handoffs and family letters were highly rated, ranging from 7.0 to 9.0 out of 10, and most participants favored their inclusion in clinical practice. However, there were several critical reservations, out of which a set of general recommendations for applying ChatGPT to clinical summaries was formulated.
Conclusion
Pediatric emergency medicine attendings in our study perceived that ChatGPT can deliver high-quality summaries while saving time and effort in many scenarios, but not all.},

This study explores how generative artificial intelligence capabilities (GAIC) could affect digital supply chain performance (DSCP) through ambidexterity innovation (AMI), which includes both elements, exploratory and exploitative innovations in the manufacturing firms (MFs) in Jordan as a developing and emerging economy. This study adopted a quantitative methodology for the data collection process applying a cross-sectional approach through testing deductive-hypotheses techniques. 263 valid surveys were used for analysis using hybrid analysis measurements (i.e., PLS-SEM, and CB-SEM). Further, it was applied data reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity tests. Additionally, examined the mediating effect of exploratory innovation (EXPI), and exploitative innovation (EXTI) on DSCP. The study findings assured that the proposed direct and indirect causal associations illustrated in the study model were accepted due to that all associations between the dimensions s were statistically significant. The findings of the GAIC supported a positive relationship between GAIC and the DSCP, GAIC on EXPI and EXTI, and EXPI and EXTI on DSCP respectively. Furthermore, the mediating effect of EXPI and EXTI is statistically significant, which was confirmed. This study developed a conceptual model to merge GAIC, AMI, and DSCP. This study provides new outcomes that bridge the existing research gap in the literature by testing the mediation model with a focus on the MF benefits of GAIC to improve levels of EXPI, EXTI, and DSCP in Jordan as a developing and emerging economy. Furthermore, this study is considered unique, as it was the first study in Jordan, and through applying hybrid analysis measurements using both PLS-SEM and CB-SEM methods.},

    abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models serve as powerful tools for organizations aiming to integrate advanced data analysis and automation into their applications and services. Citizen data scientists—individuals without formal training but skilled in data analysis—combine domain expertise with analytical skills, making them invaluable assets in the retail sector. Generative AI models can further enhance their performance, offering a cost-effective alternative to hiring professional data scientists. However, it is unclear how AI models can effectively contribute to this development and what challenges may arise. This study explores the impact of generative AI models on citizen data scientists in retail firms. We investigate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of these models. Survey data from 268 retail companies is used to develop and validate a new model. Findings highlight that misinformation, lack of explainability, biased content generation, and data security and privacy concerns in generative AI models are major factors affecting citizen data scientists’ performance. Practical implications suggest that generative AI can empower retail firms by enabling advanced data science techniques and real-time decision-making. However, firms must address drawbacks and threats in generative AI models through robust policies and collaboration between domain experts and AI developers.},

However, there is a lack of consensus over how much experience science and engineering students have with using these tools for research-related tasks. Likewise, it is not yet known how educators and information professionals can leverage these tools to teach students strategies for information retrieval and knowledge synthesis. This study assesses the extent of students' use of AI tools in research-related tasks and if information literacy instruction could impact their perception of these tools. Responses to Likert-scale questions indicate that many students did not have extensive experience using LLMs for research-related purposes prior to the information literacy sessions. However, after participating in a didactic lecture and discussion with an engineering librarian that explored how to use these tools effectively and responsibly, many students reported viewing these tools as potentially useful for future assignments. Student responses to open-response questions suggest that librarian-led information literacy training can assist students in developing more sophisticated understandings of the limitations and use cases for artificial intelligence in inquiry-based coursework.},

Employing prompt engineering and fine-tuning of prompts, the study specifically focuses on creating listening scripts and test items using ChatGPT 4 for test-takers across a spectrum of proficiency levels (academic, low, intermediate, and advanced). For comparability, the 24 topics of these scripts were selected from topics found in academic listening tests. We conducted two types of analyses to evaluate the quality of the output. First, we performed linguistic analyses of the scripts using Coh-Metrix and Text Inspector to determine if the scripts varied linguistically as required by the prompts. Second, we analyzed topic variation and the degree of overlap in the test items. Results indicated that while ChatGPT 4 reliably produced scripts with significant textual variations, the test items generated were often long and exhibited semantic overlaps among options. This effect was also influenced by the topic. We discuss the ethical complexities that arise from the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and how generative AI (GenAI) can potentially benefit practitioners and researchers in language assessment, while recognizing its limitations.},

@article{ATHE2024113526,
    abstract = {The Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid depicts the general principle of a decision-making process. Various levels of abstraction are required to formalize the available data/information/knowledge with respect to the decision being supported. The Evaluation Model Development and Assessment Process (EMDAP) was developed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC) to guide the development and assessment of Evaluation Models (EMs) for transient and accident analysis of nuclear power plants under design basis accidents. It concerns the decision of adequacy of an EM with respect to the purpose of analysis (NPP application). However, lack of data, scaling issues, modeling limitations, computation, and experimental overhead are some of the key factors that challenge the EM adequacy decision in EMDAP. Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table (PIRT) which is used for complexity resolution can also introduce noise due to bias and variance in expert opinion and judgment. The uncertainty in the decision due to these issues and challenges can be minimized by enhancing the EMDAP from the DIKW perspective. In this work, we formulate a systematic scheme for knowledge representation, and classification and characterization of evidence to enhance clarity and transparency in the EMDAP implementation. The proposed scheme is governed by the concept of the value of information, where we contextualize, classify, characterize, and evaluate the evidence (relevant data/knowledge/information related to EM development, verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification) with respect to the relevant decision attributes or elements of EMDAP. We make use of the Predictive Capability Maturity Model (PCMM), Argumentation technique, and process quality assurance for knowledge representation to support EMDAP implementation in advanced reactor licensing applications. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to support decision-making by making it more transparent, traceable, and accountable. The illustration of the proposed scheme is provided using a system simulation code (SAS4A/SASSYS-1) as the primary EM and a generic sodium fast reactor under loss of flow accident as the target reactor application. EMDAP involves different elements that require expert input and insights. However, the process of expert elicitation may require significant resources and time. To address these issues, we identify generative artificial intelligence models as potential tool which (after systematic testing and capabilities analysis) can be used for domain specific expert elicitation and information extraction for efficient implementation of EMDAP.},

    abstract = {Introduction Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), with etiologies ranging from benign to life-threatening, necessitates rapid and accurate diagnosis, particularly for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), to initiate timely plasmapheresis preventing severe outcomes. Diagnosing TTP is challenging due to overlapping clinical features with other causes of TMA, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), compounded by that specific diagnostic tests such as biopsies or ADAMTS13 activity assays do not result immediately. This study explored GPT-4's capability in suggesting differential diagnoses for TMA patients and identifying a provisional diagnosis of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup to determine the need for prompt plasmapheresis, assessing its potential as a diagnostic support tool. Method We utilized open-access case reports from PubMed Central that provided a comprehensive list of cases with diagnosis of TMA. The exclusion criteria included cases with no access, copyright permission issues, preprints, insufficient description, non-case reports, non-English language, and no established diagnosis for TMA. Each case input including only the history and physical examination (H&P) and basic diagnostic workup excluding the confirmatory diagnosis was presented to GPT-4 in three separate trials and was prompted to provide clinical reasoning that both favored or rejected the diagnosis of TTP, create a top three differential diagnoses list selected from a comprehensive list of TMA diagnoses, and determine the necessity of plasmapheresis. Generated results were subsequently compared with the confirmed case diagnosis and management provided within the case report. Result An initial PubMed Central search identified 424 cases; 326 were excluded, resulting in 98 eligible cases. The top three differential diagnoses generated for each case in all three trials exhibited relatively higher F1-scores for ITP, TTP, HUS, and HELLP syndrome, with values of 0.58, 0.59, 0.53, and 0.7, respectively. Other causes of TMA scored below 0.5. Overall performance metrics indicated a specificity of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.80, precision of 0.28, and an F1-score of 0.42. When grouped into TTP versus non-TTP cases, the sensitivity was notably high at 0.98, showing that GPT-4 could adequately rule out TTP, although the specificity was 0.76. When comparing the case diagnosis with the primary diagnosis within the top three differential diagnoses, the overall specificity was 0.96, sensitivity was 0.56, precision was 0.58, and the F1-score was 0.57. The match rate of GPT-4 suggesting plasmapheresis compared to the case report was 76%. In cases confirmed as TTP, GPT-4 demonstrated 100% accuracy in recommending plasmapheresis. For non-TTP cases, GPT-4 showed a 66% match rate compared to the case report's decision to initiate plasmapheresis, indicating a 34% reduction in suggesting plasmapheresis for these cases. Error analysis revealed that errors were primarily due to GPT-4 ignoring pertinent findings, inaccurate knowledge, and confounding symptoms or findings within the case report itself. Discussion This study demonstrated that GPT-4 could adequately assist in the diagnosis of TMA and provide suggestions for early management of TTP based on clinical presentation and basic diagnostic workup. GPT-4 appropriately recommended plasmapheresis for TTP cases and showed a comparable performance of that of a clinically commonly used tool in these settings, PLASMIC score. However, in our study, GPT-4 made errors such as ignoring pertinent findings and demonstrating incomplete knowledge, highlighting the need for pretraining and areas to improve regarding diagnosis of TMA. The study suggested that GPT-4 could be integrated as a diagnostic support tool, especially for complex, time-sensitive conditions, while emphasizing that it should complement, not replace, clinical judgment.},

@article{BAUCON2024112027,
    abstract = {Volcanic processes create peculiar types of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems but, surprisingly, very little is known about the infaunal palaeoecology of continental volcanic ecosystems such as caldera lakes and streams. Here, we report an invertebrate trace fossil association from the largest and best-exposed Permian (Cisuralian) supervolcano in Europe, the Bolzano Supervolcano. The fossil association is dominated by abundant trace fossils that are unusually straight, i.e., their curvature is zero along the entire preserved length. The trace fossils are attributed to Planolites and Palaeophycus and they form a bioturbated texture (ichnofabric) with a characteristically high bioturbation intensity (percent bioturbated>90%). U-shaped (Arenicolites) and concentrically-lined (Cylindrichnus) burrows are minor components of the ichnofabric. The characteristics of the trace fossil association suggest substrate colonization by r-strategic organisms during periods of minor volcanic activity. In these periods of stasis, the volcanic rocks were eroded by seasonal streams, which provided suitable softground substrates for the infauna. Insects are regarded as the most plausible tracemakers of the straight burrows. Similar ichnofabrics are found in other continental volcanoclastic sites, suggesting that ichnofabrics dominated by straight burrows may represent an ichnological proxy of brief windows for colonization in volcanically influenced freshwater environments. Generative artificial intelligence has been used to graphically reconstitute the tiering pattern and the palaeoenvironment. As such, this study provides the first application of AI to the graphic representation of a bioturbated palaeoenvironment.},

    abstract = {In the complex and multidimensional field of medicine, multimodal data are prevalent and crucial for informed clinical decisions. Multimodal data span a broad spectrum of data types, including medical images (eg, MRI and CT scans), time-series data (eg, sensor data from wearable devices and electronic health records), audio recordings (eg, heart and respiratory sounds and patient interviews), text (eg, clinical notes and research articles), videos (eg, surgical procedures), and omics data (eg, genomics and proteomics). While advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new applications for knowledge retrieval and processing in the medical field, most LLMs remain limited to processing unimodal data, typically text-based content, and often overlook the importance of integrating the diverse data modalities encountered in clinical practice. This paper aims to present a detailed, practical, and solution-oriented perspective on the use of multimodal LLMs (M-LLMs) in the medical field. Our investigation spanned M-LLM foundational principles, current and potential applications, technical and ethical challenges, and future research directions. By connecting these elements, we aimed to provide a comprehensive framework that links diverse aspects of M-LLMs, offering a unified vision for their future in health care. This approach aims to guide both future research and practical implementations of M-LLMs in health care, positioning them as a paradigm shift toward integrated, multimodal data–driven medical practice. We anticipate that this work will spark further discussion and inspire the development of innovative approaches in the next generation of medical M-LLM systems.},

@article{CHOI2024,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, have shown promising potential in supporting medical education and clinical decision-making, given their vast knowledge base and natural language processing capabilities. As a general purpose AI system, ChatGPT can complete a wide range of tasks, including differential diagnosis without additional training. However, the specific application of ChatGPT in learning and applying a series of specialized, context-specific tasks mimicking the workflow of a human assessor, such as administering a standardized assessment questionnaire, followed by inputting assessment results in a standardized form, and interpretating assessment results strictly following credible, published scoring criteria, have not been thoroughly studied.
Objective
This exploratory study aims to evaluate and optimize ChatGPT’s capabilities in administering and interpreting the Sour Seven Questionnaire, an informant-based delirium assessment tool. Specifically, the objectives were to train ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 to understand and correctly apply the Sour Seven Questionnaire to clinical vignettes using prompt engineering, assess the performance of these AI models in identifying and scoring delirium symptoms against scores from human experts, and refine and enhance the models’ interpretation and reporting accuracy through iterative prompt optimization.
Methods
We used prompt engineering to train ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 models on the Sour Seven Questionnaire, a tool for assessing delirium through caregiver input. Prompt engineering is a methodology used to enhance the AI’s processing of inputs by meticulously structuring the prompts to improve accuracy and consistency in outputs. In this study, prompt engineering involved creating specific, structured commands that guided the AI models in understanding and applying the assessment tool’s criteria accurately to clinical vignettes. This approach also included designing prompts to explicitly instruct the AI on how to format its responses, ensuring they were consistent with clinical documentation standards.
Results
Both ChatGPT models demonstrated promising proficiency in applying the Sour Seven Questionnaire to the vignettes, despite initial inconsistencies and errors. Performance notably improved through iterative prompt engineering, enhancing the models’ capacity to detect delirium symptoms and assign scores. Prompt optimizations included adjusting the scoring methodology to accept only definitive “Yes” or “No” responses, revising the evaluation prompt to mandate responses in a tabular format, and guiding the models to adhere to the 2 recommended actions specified in the Sour Seven Questionnaire.
Conclusions
Our findings provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential utility of AI models such as ChatGPT in administering standardized clinical assessment tools. The results highlight the significance of context-specific training and prompt engineering in harnessing the full potential of these AI models for health care applications. Despite the encouraging results, broader generalizability and further validation in real-world settings warrant additional research.},

Objectives
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), including large language models (LLMs), has vast potential applications in health care and education. However, it is unclear how proficient LLMs are in interpreting written input and providing accurate answers in dentistry. This study aims to investigate the accuracy of GenAI in answering questions from dental licensing examinations.
Methods
A total of 1461 multiple-choice questions from question books for the US and the UK dental licensing examinations were input into 2 versions of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0. The passing rates of the US and UK dental examinations were 75.0% and 50.0%, respectively. The performance of the 2 versions of GenAI in individual examinations and dental subjects was analysed and compared.
Results
ChatGPT 3.5 correctly answered 68.3% (n = 509) and 43.3% (n = 296) of questions from the US and UK dental licensing examinations, respectively. The scores for ChatGPT 4.0 were 80.7% (n = 601) and 62.7% (n = 429), respectively. ChatGPT 4.0 passed both written dental licensing examinations, whilst ChatGPT 3.5 failed. ChatGPT 4.0 answered 327 more questions correctly and 102 incorrectly compared to ChatGPT 3.5 when comparing the 2 versions.
Conclusions
The newer version of GenAI has shown good proficiency in answering multiple-choice questions from dental licensing examinations. Whilst the more recent version of GenAI generally performed better, this observation may not hold true in all scenarios, and further improvements are necessary. The use of GenAI in dentistry will have significant implications for dentist–patient communication and the training of dental professionals.},

    abstract = {Background
Physicians are currently overwhelmed by administrative tasks and spend very little time in consultations with patients, which hampers health literacy, shared decision-making, and treatment adherence.
Objective
This study aims to examine whether digital agents constructed using fast-evolving generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, have the potential to improve consultations, adherence to treatment, and health literacy. We interviewed patients and physicians to obtain their opinions about 3 digital agents—a silent digital expert, a communicative digital expert, and a digital companion (DC).
Methods
We conducted in-depth interviews with 25 patients and 22 physicians from a purposeful sample, with the patients having a wide age range and coming from different educational backgrounds and the physicians having different medical specialties. Transcripts of the interviews were deductively coded using MAXQDA (VERBI Software GmbH) and then summarized according to code and interview before being clustered for interpretation.
Results
Statements from patients and physicians were categorized according to three consultation phases: (1) silent and communicative digital experts that are part of the consultation, (2) digital experts that hand over to a DC, and (3) DCs that support patients in the period between consultations. Overall, patients and physicians were open to these forms of digital support but had reservations about all 3 agents.
Conclusions
Ultimately, we derived 9 requirements for designing digital agents to support consultations, treatment adherence, and health literacy based on the literature and our qualitative findings.},

    abstract = {In the contemporary digital landscape, media content stands as the foundation for political news analysis, offering invaluable insights sourced from various channels like news articles, social media updates, speeches, and reports. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized Political Information Extraction (IE), automating tasks such as Event Extraction (EE) from these diverse media outlets. While traditional NLP methods often necessitate specialized expertise to build rule-based systems or train machine learning models with domain-specific datasets, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a promising alternative. These models offer accessibility, alleviating challenges associated with model construction from scratch and reducing the dependency on extensive datasets during the training phase, thus facilitating rapid implementation. However, challenges persist in handling domain-specific tasks, leading to the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating external data retrieval, enriching their contextual understanding, and expanding their knowledge base beyond pre-existing training data. To illustrate RAG’s efficacy, we introduce the Political EE system, specifically tailored to extract political event information from news articles. Understanding these political insights is essential for remaining informed about the latest political advancements, whether on a national or global scale.},

To investigate the prognostic accuracy of a non-medical generative artificial intelligence model (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4 - ChatGPT-4) as a novel aspect in predicting death and poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge based on real-life data from cardiac arrest patients.
Methods
This prospective cohort study investigates the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 to predict outcomes at hospital discharge of adult cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care at a large Swiss tertiary academic medical center (COMMUNICATE/PROPHETIC cohort study). We prompted ChatGPT-4 with sixteen prognostic parameters derived from established post-cardiac arrest scores for each patient. We compared the prognostic performance of ChatGPT-4 regarding the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios of three cardiac arrest scores (Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest [OHCA], Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis [CAHP], and PROgnostication using LOGistic regression model for Unselected adult cardiac arrest patients in the Early stages [PROLOGUE score]) for in-hospital mortality and poor neurological outcome.
Results
Mortality at hospital discharge was 43% (n = 309/713), 54% of patients (n = 387/713) had a poor neurological outcome. ChatGPT-4 showed good discrimination regarding in-hospital mortality with an AUC of 0.85, similar to the OHCA, CAHP, and PROLOGUE (AUCs of 0.82, 0.83, and 0.84, respectively) scores. For poor neurological outcome, ChatGPT-4 showed a similar prediction to the post-cardiac arrest scores (AUC 0.83).
Conclusions
ChatGPT-4 showed a similar performance in predicting mortality and poor neurological outcome compared to validated post-cardiac arrest scores. However, more research is needed regarding illogical answers for potential incorporation of an LLM in the multimodal outcome prognostication after cardiac arrest.},

@article{ASHRAF2024,
    abstract = {Background
The online pharmacy market is growing, with legitimate online pharmacies offering advantages such as convenience and accessibility. However, this increased demand has attracted malicious actors into this space, leading to the proliferation of illegal vendors that use deceptive techniques to rank higher in search results and pose serious public health risks by dispensing substandard or falsified medicines. Search engine providers have started integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into search engine interfaces, which could revolutionize search by delivering more personalized results through a user-friendly experience. However, improper integration of these new technologies carries potential risks and could further exacerbate the risks posed by illicit online pharmacies by inadvertently directing users to illegal vendors.
Objective
The role of generative AI integration in reshaping search engine results, particularly related to online pharmacies, has not yet been studied. Our objective was to identify, determine the prevalence of, and characterize illegal online pharmacy recommendations within the AI-generated search results and recommendations.
Methods
We conducted a comparative assessment of AI-generated recommendations from Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Microsoft Bing’s Chat, focusing on popular and well-known medicines representing multiple therapeutic categories including controlled substances. Websites were individually examined to determine legitimacy, and known illegal vendors were identified by cross-referencing with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and LegitScript databases.
Results
Of the 262 websites recommended in the AI-generated search results, 47.33% (124/262) belonged to active online pharmacies, with 31.29% (82/262) leading to legitimate ones. However, 19.04% (24/126) of Bing Chat’s and 13.23% (18/136) of Google SGE’s recommendations directed users to illegal vendors, including for controlled substances. The proportion of illegal pharmacies varied by drug and search engine. A significant difference was observed in the distribution of illegal websites between search engines. The prevalence of links leading to illegal online pharmacies selling prescription medications was significantly higher (P=.001) in Bing Chat (21/86, 24%) compared to Google SGE (6/92, 6%). Regarding the suggestions for controlled substances, suggestions generated by Google led to a significantly higher number of rogue sellers (12/44, 27%; P=.02) compared to Bing (3/40, 7%).
Conclusions
While the integration of generative AI into search engines offers promising potential, it also poses significant risks. This is the first study to shed light on the vulnerabilities within these platforms while highlighting the potential public health implications associated with their inadvertent promotion of illegal pharmacies. We found a concerning proportion of AI-generated recommendations that led to illegal online pharmacies, which could not only potentially increase their traffic but also further exacerbate existing public health risks. Rigorous oversight and proper safeguards are urgently needed in generative search to mitigate consumer risks, making sure to actively guide users to verified pharmacies and prioritize legitimate sources while excluding illegal vendors from recommendations.},

Campus guide systems are crucial to university infrastructure, shaping the experiences of students, staff, and visitors. Current systems face critical challenges in three areas: capturing diverse user needs, translating emotional requirements into design elements, and integrating campus cultural identity. This study integrates Kansei Engineering (KE) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AIGC) to propose a semantic-driven design method. Using Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing (NLP), it models demand semantics, extracts emotional semantics such as safety and belonging, and maps them to design semantics for AIGC to generate personalized guide solutions. The approach leverages data-driven emotional semantic analysis and generative models to improve path guidance precision and cultural representation. Results indicate significant improvements in user experience, pathfinding accuracy, and cultural communication, with higher user satisfaction. This method provides a new semantic-driven pathway for developing campus guide systems and development prospects.},

This perspective advocates for urgent strategies to enhance resilience through effective emergency management and prevention measures tailored to this critical domain. The analysis here exposed, which includes elements of ontology and the conceptual approach of an emergency management system encompassing both restoration and prevention aspects, entails three case studies across the AFA domain. Each case study, described by location, timing, nature, and consequences, critically evaluates the implemented risk prevention measures, details the emergency and recovery actions, and highlights shortcomings in response efforts. The analysis, incorporating a retrospective comparative component based on the proposed conceptual model, highlights the importance of identifying lessons learned and potential future applications. It emphasizes the urgent need for a well-structured emergency management strategy that integrates risk mapping and advanced technology to ensure timely and effective responses. The active engagement of domain professionals (agronomists, foresters, animal production doctors) and scholars of AFA domain sciences, as either farm owners or technical advisors, is crucial to optimize intervention strategies. This engagement is especially important for enhancing resilience during recovery phases, aligning with the best international practices such as making use of local knowledge and citizen engagement strategies. Comprehensive training initiatives, also adopting innovative formats and tools including micro-credentials, e-learning platforms, and the applications of generative Artificial Intelligence for learning assistance, as well as new research insights are strategic for coordinated and effective emergency responses across all stakeholders. Collaboration between the different production systems and areas of expertise, raising awareness of the distinction between Civil Protection and Production Protection and fostering their close interconnection, is essential for effective emergency response and long-term resilience.},

Modern technology-driven SPP promotes personalized product design and manufacturing suited to support environmentally friendly products for the circular economy. In this study, we develop a framework pertaining to the interlinks between SPP, big data analytics, machine learning, and the circular economy. To test our framework, we apply structure equation modeling based on data collected from more than 200 automotive industry professionals operating in China. Our results demonstrate that SPP and big data analytics are the central determinants for manufacturing environmentally friendly products, ultimately promoting circular economy applications. SPP plays a pivotal role in innovative product design and in facilitating the relevant manufacturing procedures. Big data analytics significantly feed into SPP applications. Machine learning and flexibility in SPP perform moderating roles in strengthening environmentally friendly outcomes. The mediating role played by SPP between big data analytics and environmentally friendly products for the circular economy is partially encouraging. As SPP powered by AI and Generative AI is an emerging phenomenon, our study contributes to this new knowledge dimension. We conclude this paper by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our study, its limitations, and directions for future research.},

This study employs PLS-SEM to explore the relationships between social influence, information quality, and behavioural intentions regarding ChatGPT usage among business students. Drawing from data collected from 477 business students, the study unveils that both social influence and information quality significantly impact behavioural intentions. Moreover, information quality strengthens the influence of social influence on behavioural intentions. The multigroup analysis reveals that the effects of social influence and information quality on behavioural intentions differ between females and males. However, the moderating effect of information quality does not differ significantly between them. Furthermore, the effects observed in all hypothesised relationships do not differ significantly between first-year and second-year students. By empirically validating the proposed model for behavioural intentions regarding ChatGPT usage and identifying statistical differences among males and females, as well as between first-year and second-year students, this study contributes to filling existing knowledge gaps. Furthermore, the study offers potential avenues for future research and serves as a valuable resource for academics, professionals, and policymakers interested in understanding students' engagement with generative AI.},

However, a detailed understanding of the factors associated with pain in PD is still evolving. In this study, we examined the disability caused by pain and the pain experienced by PD patients using two validated questionnaires, namely the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) and the King's Parkinson's Disease Pain Questionnaire (KPPQ). Customized questions were also included to further explore the pain experience and management strategies adopted by PD patients. Through statistical analysis, we explored the relationships between questionnaire scores, socio-demographic data, and other relevant variables. Additionally, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) was employed to gain a deeper understanding of patient responses. The results indicate the extent and impact of pain in PD and provide valuable insights for more targeted and personalized management. This study lays the foundation for future research and the development of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life for individuals affected by this condition.},

This paper investigated the potential benefits of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, concentrating on the design and evaluation of an AI Educational Video Assistant tailored for multimodal learning experiences. The tool, utilizing the principles of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), comprises three modules: Transcription, Engagement, and Reinforcement, each focusing on distinct aspects of the learning process. It Integraties Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using OpenAI's Whisper and Google's Large Language Model (LLM) Bard. Our twofold objective includes both the development of this AI assistant tool and the assessment of its effect on improving the learning experiences. For the evaluation, a mixed methods approach was adopted, combining human evaluation by nine educational experts with automatic metrics. Participants provided their perceptions on the tool's effectiveness in terms of engagement, content organization, clarity, and usability. Additionally, automatic metrics including Content Distinctiveness and Readability scores were computed. The results from the human evaluation suggest positive impacts across all assessed domains. The automatic metrics further proved the tool's ability in content generation and readability. Collectively, these preliminary results highlight the tool's potential to revolutionize educational design and provide personalized and engaging learning experiences.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents a disruptive innovation for brands and society, and the power of which is still yet to be realized. In the context of customer service, gen AI affords companies new possibilities to communicate, connect, and engage customers. This article draws on scholarly research and consultation with customer service leaders to present and discuss the possibilities for GenAI in the context of customer service, specifically GenAI chatbots. Importantly, this article presents potential paradoxes of GenAI-enabled customer service, adding to the debate about the role and impact of GenAI for brands. Specifically, we present six paradoxes of GenAI customer service: (1) connected yet isolated, (2) lower cost yet higher price, (3) higher quality yet less empathy, (4) satisfied yet frustrated, (5) personalized yet intrusive, and (6) powerful yet vulnerable. For each paradox, we suggest brand response strategies to mitigate downside and manage potential upside.},

    abstract = {In recent years, there have been unparalleled prospects for psychological study due to the swift advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in natural language processing, shown by ChatGPT. This review article looks into the uses and effects of generative artificial intelligence in psychology. We employed a systematic selection process, encompassing papers published between 2015 and 2024 from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore, using keywords like “Generative AI in psychology” “ChatGPT and behavior modeling” and “AI in mental health”. First, the paper goes over the fundamental ideas of generative AI and lists its uses in data analysis, behavior modeling, and social interaction simulation. A detailed comparison table has been added to contrast conventional research methodologies with GenAI-based approaches in psychology studies. Next, analyzing the theoretical and ethical issues that generative AI raises for psychological research, it highlights how crucial it is to develop a coherent theoretical framework. This study illustrates the benefits of generative AI in handling vast amounts of data and increasing research efficiency by contrasting traditional research methods with AI-driven methodologies. Regarding particular uses, the study explores how generative AI might be used to simulate social interactions, analyze massive amounts of text, and learn about cognitive processes. Section 5 has been expanded to include discussions on political biases, geographic biases, and other biases. In conclusion, the paper looks forward to the future development of generative AI in psychology research and suggests techniques for improving it. We have included methodological solutions such as the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as data privacy solutions like open-source local LLMs. In summary, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize psychological research, but in order to maintain the moral and scientific integrity of the field, ethical and theoretical concerns must be carefully considered before applying the technology.},

    abstract = {Clinical decision-making is a crucial aspect of health care, involving the balanced integration of scientific evidence, clinical judgment, ethical considerations, and patient involvement. This process is dynamic and multifaceted, relying on clinicians’ knowledge, experience, and intuitive understanding to achieve optimal patient outcomes through informed, evidence-based choices. The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) presents a revolutionary opportunity in clinical decision-making. AI’s advanced data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities can significantly enhance the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, processing vast medical data to identify patterns, tailor treatments, predict disease progression, and aid in proactive patient management. However, the incorporation of AI into clinical decision-making raises concerns regarding the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated insights. To address these concerns, 11 “verification paradigms” are proposed in this paper, with each paradigm being a unique method to verify the evidence-based nature of AI in clinical decision-making. This paper also frames the concept of “clinically explainable, fair, and responsible, clinician-, expert-, and patient-in-the-loop AI.” This model focuses on ensuring AI’s comprehensibility, collaborative nature, and ethical grounding, advocating for AI to serve as an augmentative tool, with its decision-making processes being transparent and understandable to clinicians and patients. The integration of AI should enhance, not replace, the clinician’s judgment and should involve continuous learning and adaptation based on real-world outcomes and ethical and legal compliance. In conclusion, while generative AI holds immense promise in enhancing clinical decision-making, it is essential to ensure that it produces evidence-based, reliable, and impactful knowledge. Using the outlined paradigms and approaches can help the medical and patient communities harness AI’s potential while maintaining high patient care standards.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This purpose of this paper is to report on the development of an evidence-informed framework created to facilitate the formulation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) academic integrity policy responses for English medium instruction (EMI) higher education, responding to both the bespoke challenges for the sector and longstanding calls to define and disseminate quality implementation good practice.
Design/methodology/approach
A virtual nominal group technique engaged experts (n = 14) in idea generation, refinement and consensus building across asynchronous and synchronous stages. The resulting qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics, respectively.
Findings
The GenAI Academic Integrity Policy Development Blueprint for EMI Tertiary Education is not a definitive mandate but represents a roadmap of inquiry for reflective deliberation as institutions chart their own courses in this complex terrain.
Research limitations/implications
If repeated with varying expert panellists, findings may vary to a certain extent; thus, further research with a wider range of stakeholders may be necessary for additional validation.
Practical implications
While grounded within the theoretical underpinnings of the field, the tool holds practical utility for stakeholders to develop bespoke policies and critically re-examine existing frameworks.
Social implications
As texts produced by students using English as an additional language are at risk of being wrongly accused of GenAI-assisted plagiarism, owing to the limited efficacy of text classifiers such as Turnitin, the policy recommendations encapsulated in the blueprint aim to reduce potential bias and unfair treatment of students.
Originality/value
The novel blueprint represents a step towards bridging concerning gaps in policy responses worldwide and aims to spark discussion and further much-needed scholarly exploration to this end.},

    abstract = {Aims
The aim of this study is to use generative artificial intelligence to perform bibliometric analysis on abstracts published at European Resuscitation Council (ERC) annual scientific congress and define trends in ERC guidelines topics over the last decade.
Methods
In this bibliometric analysis, the WebHarvy software (SysNucleus, India) was used to download data from the Resuscitation journal's website through the technique of web scraping. Next, the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (ChatGPT-4) application programming interface (Open AI, USA) was used to implement the multinomial classification of abstract titles following the ERC 2021 guidelines topics.
Results
From 2012 to 2022 a total of 2491 abstracts have been published at ERC congresses. Published abstracts ranged from 88 (in 2020) to 368 (in 2015). On average, the most common ERC guidelines topics were Adult basic life support (50.1%), followed by Adult advanced life support (41.5%), while Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth (2.1%) was the least common topic. The findings also highlight that the Basic Life Support and Adult Advanced Life Support ERC guidelines topics have the strongest co-occurrence to all ERC guidelines topics, where the Newborn resuscitation and support of transition of infants at birth (2.1%; 52/2491) ERC guidelines topic has the weakest co-occurrence.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence in the bibliometric analysis of abstract titles using the example of resuscitation medicine research over the last decade at ERC conferences using large language models.},

In particular, generative AI (GenAI), a subset of AI able to generate content tasks based on Large Language Models (LLM), has recently gained momentum. Based on an extensive analysis of generative AI use cases in large enterprises, we find that Gen AI shows strong labor productivity improvements across metrics such as throughput time, unit cost, and task effectiveness. However, the distribution of gains is asymmetric in favor of a few companies. While the current distribution of gains does not provide evidence of a power law effect, the current asymmetry reflects differences in AI resources/capabilities across companies - mainly data access, AI talent, or AI governance.},

It shows how ChatGPT, a typical GAI, can affect practices, decision-making responsibility and the management disciplines through a dual discourse. The first one emanates from technological solutionism, a belief that any problem can be solved with the assistance of technology (the technosolutionist discourse), and the second one concerns the utterances generated by ChatGPT itself, which are shaped by various algorithmic, epistemic and linguistic influences (the generative discourse). In simpler terms, what ChatGPT can do to management appears to depend on “what is said about it” and “what it says”. In contrast to the existing literature on ChatGPT’s potential influence on organizations, this article, through its discursive approach, takes a non-normative position, to reveal the subtler influences of generative artificial intelligence, and highlight the individual and organizational responsibilities of actors interacting with these two discourses. The conclusions may be of interest to management readers in general, and of more particular interest to the accounting profession, as the conceptualization is based more broadly on examples taken from accounting, given the close link between the accounting profession and information technologies.},

    abstract = {Hypothesis / aims of study
Since its availability for public usage, ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence (gAI) and large language model services have been tested for their ability and utilization in a number of medical diagnostic procedures and surgical education. Over time, ChatGPT’s ability to provide concise assessments and evaluations has improved so has its ability to learn and research true resources and references, while previous concerns about its shortcomings with regard to hallucinations and fallacy, among other issues, are easing. Urodynamic studies’ good practices and terminology have been described and published by the International Continence Society (ICS) and are recommended for practitioners 1, 3. We report on ChatGPTs ability to analyze urodynamic traces correctly before and after teaching it the ICS best practices and terms for urodynamics, cystometry and pressure-flow studies.
Study design, materials and methods
We chose at random urodynamic traces including cystometries and pressure-flow studies conducted at our institution by a single functional urology expert. The traces were then reassessed by another expert, and agreement in the assessments was noted. Any disagreement was resolved by a third expert. ChatGPT 4o was used, and it was asked to analyze the same traces twice: first batch without instruction to use certain resources or teaching, and the second batch after it was taught and instructed to use the ICS standards 1, 3. Parameters analyzed include components of the urodynamics traces as well as select nomograms, overall diagnosis and devising a management plan accordingly. Concordance with expert opinion before and after teaching ChatGPT was calculated and statistical significance of the teaching was calculated using McNemar’s test. Institutional board review approval was obtained.
Results
We analyzed a total of 100 urodynamic traces of different etiologies, of which 75% were of female patients. The most common presenting complaint was mixed urinary incontinence, while the most common diagnosis was non-neurogenic dry detrusor overactivity. With regards to assessments of filling cystometry results, ChatGPT did not exhibit any improvement or regression in its ability to correctly diagnose dysfunctions in sensation (p=1), cystometric capacity (p=0.1336), bladder compliance (p=0.4795), urinary incontinence (p=0.3711), and electromyography (EMG) synergy or dyssynergia (p=0.7728). The only parameter that reached some statistical significance was ChatGPTs ability to identify uninhibited detrusor contractions after teaching it (p=0.07). In a similar manner, ChatGPT’s ability to assess voided volume, detrusor pressure at maximal flow (Pdet@Qmax), maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax), and identify after contractions remained unchanged after instruction and teaching (p>0.1), as well as its ability to calculate the bladder contractility index (p=0.25), provide an overall diagnosis (p=1) and formulate an appropriate management plan (p=0.13).
Interpretation of results
This study demonstrates that ChatGPT-4o has a consistent baseline ability to interpret urodynamic traces irrespective of formal instruction. Notably, its capacity to identify uninhibited detrusor contractions improved following exposure to ICS terminology and standards (p = 0.07), suggesting promise for refinement with targeted training.
Concluding message
Our findings underscore ChatGPT’s emerging utility in functional urology as a consistent, adaptable tool with the potential to support clinical education and decision-making. To enhance ChatGPT’s accuracy in interpreting urodynamic studies, future development should focus on multimodal fine-tuning using annotated trace-image datasets aligned with ICS standards, and gAI may eventually play a valuable role in standardizing and scaling access to urodynamic interpretation expertise.

    abstract = {Background and objective
Generative artificial intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots (“chatbots”). These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients. The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.
Material and methods
Three “chatbot” models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.
Results
ChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%). Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all three applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.
Conclusions
While conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over generative artificial intelligence.
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial generativa es una tecnología que ofrece su mayor conectividad con las personas gracias a los bots conversacionales («chatbot»). Estos pueden mantener un diálogo con un lenguaje natural indistinguible del humano y son una fuente potencial de información para los pacientes. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar el rendimiento de estos bots en la resolución de cuestiones específicas de cirugía ortopédica y traumatología empleando las preguntas del examen MIR español entre 2008 y 2023.
Material y métodos
Se analizaron 3 modelos de «chatbots» (ChatGPT, Bard y Perplexity) respondiendo a 114 preguntas del MIR. Se compararon aciertos, se valoró la legibilidad de las respuestas y se examinó su dependencia con el razonamiento lógico y la información interna y externa. En los fallos también se evaluó el tipo de error.
Resultados
ChatGPT obtuvo un 72,81% de aciertos, seguido por Perplexity (67,54%) y Bard (60,53%). Las respuestas más legibles y completas las ofrece Bard. Las respuestas demostraron un razonamiento lógico y el uso de información interna de los enunciados de preguntas. En 16 preguntas (14%) las 3 aplicaciones fallaron simultáneamente. Se identificaron errores, que incluían fallos lógicos y de información.
Conclusiones
Aunque los bots conversacionales pueden ser útiles en la resolución de preguntas médicas, se señala la necesidad de precaución debido a la posibilidad de errores. Actualmente deben considerarse como una herramienta en desarrollo, y la opinión humana debe prevalecer sobre la inteligencia artificial generativa.},

    abstract = {This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.},

    abstract = {In this work, we introduce a new methodology to combine the available methods to predict the properties of complex hydrocarbon mixtures such as aviation fuels. Due to the complexity of aviation fuels, the available methods perform well individually on some of the experimental observations and vice versa on others when a surrogate aviation fuel is defined and used. To this end, we introduce a new ensemble model based on the existing methods that combine and weigh their predictions. We employ the probabilistic Bayesian approach to predict aviation fuel properties with confidence levels. This is necessary because the available experimental data for aviation fuels is generally limited, which leads to overfitting. We adopt both “interpretable” Bayesian regression and a more “black-box” approach to Bayesian neural networks. An ensemble of predictive methods provided better predictions than the individual methods with robust confidence levels for three properties considered: mass density, kinematic viscosity, and flash point. A significant reduction in the mean absolute percentage error was obtained for mass density predictions, from 1.25% to 0.57% and 0.42%, using the Bayesian linear regression (BLR) and Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), respectively. The error in kinematic viscosity predictions was reduced from 17.25% to 9.02% and 6.79% using BLR and BNN, respectively. The error in flash point predictions is reduced from 9.04% to 5.83% by BLR and to 5.51% by BNN. The importance of the methods in the ensemble did not fully follow their individual performance, where the accurate models may not be the most important. The ensemble approach allows for the inclusion of new methods, even if they are slightly less accurate. This methodology can be extended to predict other aviation fuel properties and incorporate any predictive model. It also offers a way to generate valid training data for generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, helping to address the scarcity of aviation fuel data.},

    abstract = {Introduction
The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to permeate most industries, including medicine, and patients will inevitably start using these large language model (LLM) chatbots as a modality for education. As healthcare information technology evolves, it is imperative to evaluate chatbots and the accuracy of the information they provide to patients and to determine if there is variability between them.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of three chatbots in addressing questions related to endometriosis and determine the level of variability between them.
Study Design
Three LLMs, including Chat GPT-4 (Open AI), Claude (Anthropic), and Bard (Google) were asked to generate answers to 10 commonly asked questions about endometriosis. The responses were qualitatively compared to current guidelines and expert opinion on endometriosis and rated on a scale by nine gynecologists. The grading scale included the following: (1) Completely incorrect, (2) mostly incorrect and some correct, (3) mostly correct and some incorrect, (4) correct but inadequate, (5) correct and comprehensive. Final scores were averaged between the nine reviewers. Kendall's W and the related chi-square test were used to evaluate the reviewers’ strength of agreement in ranking the LLMs’ responses for each item.
Results
Average scores for the 10 answers amongst Bard, Chat GPT, and Claude were 3.69, 4.24, and 3.7, respectively. Two questions showed significant disagreement between the nine reviewers. There were no questions the models could answer comprehensively or correctly across the reviewers. The model most associated with comprehensive and correct responses was ChatGPT. Chatbots showed an improved ability to accurately answer questions about symptoms and pathophysiology over treatment and risk of recurrence.
Conclusion
The analysis of LLMs revealed that, on average, they mainly provided correct but inadequate responses to commonly asked patient questions about endometriosis. While chatbot responses can serve as valuable supplements to information provided by licensed medical professionals, it is crucial to maintain a thorough ongoing evaluation process for outputs to provide the most comprehensive and accurate information to patients. Further research into this technology and its role in patient education and treatment is crucial as generative AI becomes more embedded in the medical field.},

This study examined configurations of learner autonomy, collaborative learning, GAI-supported language learning, and GAI-supported project-based learning among 43 undergraduate students engaged in a 12-week intervention. Results identified four pathways to enhanced language development: autonomy with GAI language support, synergistic integration of autonomy and collaboration with GAI in projects, comprehensive GAI integration with collaborative practices, and an individualistic pathway combining autonomy with GAI tools. Necessity analysis revealed that absence of GAI-supported language learning consistently predicted failure. These findings demonstrate the configurational nature of effective GAI integration in language education and provide guidance for implementing these tools across diverse instructional settings.},

    abstract = {As generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has recently gained popularity, society is undergoing a full-scale transformation centered around AI. This technology is attracting attention across various fields, particularly as it meets the growing demand for ‘24/7 availability’. Among these applications, AI chatbot-based Robotic Process Automation (RPA) systems have demonstrated the ability to automate tasks, and with the integration of generative AI, they can now handle more advanced operations such as sending emails and managing complex workflows. However, because AI chatbot-based RPA systems are required to perform sensitive and high-level tasks, secure identity authentication is essential. Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based authentication mechanisms pose risks, as they often require storing personal information within the AI chatbot system—potentially increasing the damage in the event of a security breach. To address this issue, this paper proposes an authentication mechanism that uses a Decentralized Identity (DID)-based one-time session key. By leveraging DID technology, the proposed mechanism ensures self-sovereignty and privacy. Furthermore, the use of a one-time session key guarantees session independence, non-reusability, and untraceability. A performance comparison with PKI-based mechanisms shows that when more than five authentications are performed, the proposed mechanism achieves higher time efficiency, highlighting its advantages in both security and effectiveness. Additionally, potential security threats in each step of the proposed system are analyzed probabilistically. A mathematical formula is presented to demonstrate that the likelihood of such threats occurring is very low. By performing partial differentiation on the attack success probability with respect to representative variables at each step, the analysis identifies which authentication process most significantly influences overall system security. This provides clear insights for designing secure authentication systems based on the proposed approach.},

    abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used to create content, it is often criticized for collecting and training private data and induces potential copy infringement issue. This dilemma leaves a question of whether GAI increases or decreases creators' work sharing. Drawn on protection motivation theory, this study examines how the launch of a GAI system affects creators' contributions on an original work sharing platform. We discover that GAI poses a threat to drawing-category creators, leading to a significant crowding-out effect on their contributions. Specifically, compared with that of non-drawing-category creators, the work sharing of drawing-category creators decreases by 19.64 % and 14.29 % within a short period after the launch and removal of the GAI system, respectively. We discover that creators' protective behavior is driven by GAI-related copyright infringement. Compared with creators without copyright protection, those with copyright protection are more inclined to cease contributions or even leave the platform. We further find that among copyright-protected creators, top creators, evidenced by their acquisition of a large number of supporters or platform honor titles, exhibit more pronounced responses to protect their works due to their higher coping efficacy. Notably, this threat reduces creators' sharing behavior or even lead to their exit from the platform. Nevertheless, such reduction is likely to gradually recover once the threat subsides. Overall, our findings have important implications for whether and how platform managers adopt GAI systems, especially in an original work sharing context.},

Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), an AI-based Chatbot, is being utilized in nursing education, research and practice. However, little is known about its pattern of usage, which prompted this study.
Objective
To provide a concise overview of the existing literature on the application of ChatGPT in nursing education, practice and research.
Methods
A rapid review based on the Cochrane methodology was applied to synthesize existing literature. We conducted systematic searches in several databases, including CINAHL, Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Education Search Complete, ERIC, and Cochrane CENTRAL, to ensure no publications were missed. All types of primary and secondary research studies, including qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, and literature reviews published in the English language focused on the use of ChatGPT in nursing education, research, and practice, were included. Dissertations or theses, conference proceedings, government and other organizational reports, white papers, discussion papers, opinion pieces, editorials, commentaries, and published review protocols were excluded. Studies involving other healthcare professionals and/or students without including nursing participants were excluded. Studies exploring other language models without comparison to ChatGPT and those examining the technical specifications of ChatGPT were excluded. Data screening was completed in two stages: titles and abstract and full-text review, followed by data extraction and quality appraisal. Descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis were applied to summarize and categorize the findings.
Results
Seventeen studies were included: 15 (88.2 %) focused on nursing education and one each on nursing practice and research. Of the 17 included studies, 5 (29.4 %) were evaluation studies, 3 (17.6 %) were narrative reviews, 3 (17.6 %) were cross-sectional studies, 2 (11.8 %) were descriptive studies, and 1 (5.9 %) was a randomized controlled trial, quasi-experimental study, case study, and qualitative study, respectively.
Conclusion
This study has provided a snapshot of ChatGPT usage in nursing education, research, and practice. Although evidence is inconclusive, integration of ChatGPT should consider addressing ethical concerns and ongoing education on ChatGPT usage. Further research, specifically interventional studies, is recommended to ascertain and track the impact of ChatGPT in different contexts.},

It first outlines the historical progress in SMS intervention research publications and the variety of funds from US government agencies. A narrative review follows, highlighting the effectiveness of SMS interventions in key health areas, such as physical activity, diet and weight loss, mental health, and substance use, based on published meta-analyses. It then outlines advantages of text messaging compared to other digital modalities, including the real-time capability to collect information and deliver microdoses of intervention support. Crucial design elements are proposed to optimize effectiveness and longitudinal engagement across communication strategies, psychological foundations, and behavior change tactics. We then discuss advanced functionalities, such as the potential for generative artificial intelligence to improve user interaction. Finally, major challenges to implementation are highlighted, including the absence of a dedicated commercial platform, privacy and security concerns with SMS technology, difficulties integrating SMS interventions with medical informatics systems, and concerns about user engagement. Proposed solutions aim to facilitate the broader application and effectiveness of SMS interventions. Our hope is that these insights can assist researchers and practitioners in using SMS interventions to improve health outcomes and reducing disparities.},

    abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies occupy a bigger role in psychiatric and psychological care and become the object of increased research attention, industry investment, and public scrutiny, tools for evaluating their clinical, ethical, and user-centricity standards have become essential. In this paper, we first review the history of rating systems used to evaluate AI mental health interventions. We then describe the recently introduced Framework for AI Tool Assessment in Mental Health (FAITA-Mental Health), whose scoring system allows users to grade AI mental health platforms on key domains, including credibility, user experience, crisis management, user agency, health equity, and transparency. Finally, we demonstrate the use of FAITA-Mental Health scale by systematically applying it to OCD Coach, a generative AI tool readily available on the ChatGPT store and designed to help manage the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results offer insights into the utility and limitations of FAITA-Mental Health when applied to “real-world” generative AI platforms in the mental health space, suggesting that the framework effectively identifies key strengths and gaps in AI-driven mental health tools, particularly in areas such as credibility, user experience, and acute crisis management. The results also highlight the need for stringent standards to guide AI integration into mental health care in a manner that is not only effective but also safe and protective of the users’ rights and welfare.},

Conducted in an initial language teacher education programme at a Hong Kong university, this mixed-method intervention study aims to explore the effects of explicit training for using GenAI tools for language teaching in rising pre-service language teachers’ professional GenAI competence (P-GenAI-C). 54 M.Ed students took part in an 11-week course intervention aiming to enhance the five aspects in the P-GenAI-C framework. Analysis of pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, which encompassed a mix of open and closed items to gather participants’ knowledge and perceptions of utilising GenAI tools, as well as the follow-up interviews, revealed that the intervention was effective in stretching all aspects of pre-service teachers’ P-GenAI-C. While there was greater evidence of improvement in participants’ pedagogical competence and critical awareness of GenAI tools deployment, there was less evidence of development in other aspects, such as teachers’ capacity to guide their students to use GenAI tools effectively and responsibly. This discrepancy might be attributed to the lack of such content in the course intervention. Implications for incorporating elements of P-GenAI-C into teacher preparation courses and programmes are discussed.},

However, despite the efforts of traditional medical education, it falls short in providing them with the required tools to effectively overcome these difficulties. In light of these shortcomings, this paper suggests the development of a new educational framework designed to guide medical educators in creating student-centered learning experiences. Which may be ensured by using Design Thinking (DT) as an instructional design method, merged with constructive alignment principles, and generative artificial intelligence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new educational approach, a case study is showcased wherein the framework was applied to design a new medical curriculum. The case study specifically focuses on first-year students in a Moroccan medical faculty and was developed based on DT principles, allowing students to engage in a transformative learning process that encourages innovation and creativity. The new curriculum includes lecture sessions, hands-on workshops, and project coaching where teams of medical students learn the design process and are given the opportunity to prototype and test their proposed solutions at local university hospital units. Overall, the showcased case study provides evidence of the framework's effectiveness in designing a new medical curriculum, illustrating its potential for enhancing medical education and engaging future doctors in impact-focused projects with long-term benefits for their career development.},

    abstract = {Optimisation of the product design and development cycle is crucial for maintaining product quality and ensuring lower production costs. It is necessary to intervene at early stages to prevent future expenses. Leveraging rapid digitalisation to achieve the desired goals and bringing in ‘smart manufacturing’ will benefit industries with large-scale productions. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance ‘design for manufacturability (DfM)’ paradigm. Integrating digital twins and generative artificial intelligence (AI), a software is proposed that not only simulates real-world environments for testing and visualisation of potential processes but also provides designs to optimise the manufacturing process, maintain cost, and enhance the product’s appeal to the target market. The proposed model uses sensors to replicate the product in a digital environment to run a simulation. Meanwhile, a generative AI model embedded in the software provides creative and effective solutions based on user requirements and market data. When incorporated into the product development cycle, this process will ensure cost efficiency and improve the time required to develop quality products, enabling quicker launches. Thus, combining these emerging technologies yields a powerful, innovative model that enhances design for manufacturability.},

However, its impact on consumer behavior has remained empirically untested. In response to social media platforms mandating the disclosure of GenAI content, we investigate how followers perceive brands that use GenAI for content creation. Drawing from literature on algorithm aversion and brand authenticity, the results of three experimental studies indicate that brands' GenAI adoption induces negative attitudinal and behavioral follower reactions. These effects are mediated by followers' perceptions of brand authenticity and can be triggered by GenAI disclosure. Negative reactions are attenuated if GenAI is used to assist humans in content creation rather than to replace them through automation. Our findings underscore the need for nuance in brands’ GenAI adoption to unlock economic benefits without compromising on relationships with consumers.},

It has the potential to provide psychological benefits for visitors, including attention restoration, stress reduction, and anxiety alleviation. This study explores how AR can foster these benefits within museum spaces. By adopting AR technology, museums can go beyond their traditional roles of knowledge dissemination. The immersive, adaptive, and interactive features of AR can enhance the museum experience, transforming it into an innovative therapeutic space. By combining real exhibits with virtual elements, AR can restore visitors’ psychological energy within museum settings. This integration of digital innovation into restorative contexts surpasses the traditional functions of visual service. Through empirical investigation of multiple dimensions of restorative environments, AR museum experiences offer comprehensive attention restoration. In this study, a survey was conducted with 279 participants to assess the impact of AR museum experiences on visitors’ psychology. The results revealed that such experiences contribute to heightened attention restoration levels, stress reduction, and anxiety relief. With the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence, AR technology is empowered to integrate within museums. This integration will merge individuals with customized technology, expanding human perceptual experiences and highlighting AR's significant influence within the museum environment.},

This study conducts in-depth interviews and thematic analysis to explore how the use of GenAI affects negative work behaviors among tourism and hospitality practitioners. The results show that employees’ technical fear towards AI is negatively associated with their sense of realism, self-investment, and habitual perception, but positively associated with the perceived threat of job intelligence to employment. Moreover, the technical fear towards AI can be positively associated with their transgression behavior. The findings of this study can be illuminating for helping tourism and hospitality organizations develop sustainable and healthy workplace guidelines.},

Despite their potential benefits in academic support, questions persist about the concrete advantages of integrating this technology into learning processes and its impact on academic outcomes. This research addresses this gap by investigating the influence of technology integration on academic performance, employing the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework and self-determination theory. The empirical findings from Chinese business students using Wenjuanxing platform reveal a positive impact of technology integration on business students' motivation, encompassing their learning desires, self-efficacy, and future beliefs, ultimately leading to enhanced academic performance. Notably, while epistemic curiosity augments the effects of technology integration on learning desires and future beliefs, its influence on self-efficacy is not significant. This suggests that curiosity alone might not be enough to alter deeply ingrained beliefs about one’s capabilities. In conclusion, this study underscores the academic significance of these findings and their practical implications for educators and business students in optimizing ChatGPT’s potential for academic success.},

These advancements have reverberated across a wide spectrum of applications, catalyzing transformative outcomes. However, in stark contrast, the field of digital rock analysis finds itself grappling with a conspicuous dearth of data, a challenge that casts a formidable shadow over the effective deployment of computer vision techniques for rock image analysis. In response to this pressing issue, this paper presents a pioneering methodology designed to surmount the hurdles posed by data limitation in the realm of digital rock analysis. At the core of this innovative approach lies the fusion of artificially generated digital rock images, created using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, with their authentic counterparts. This fusion is guided by the overarching objective of augmenting the efficacy of various digital rock analysis applications. This integration endeavors to bridge the gap between the limited available data and the substantial demands of the digital rock analysis domain. The practical significance and potential of this integrated approach are vividly demonstrated through a series of concrete implementations. These include, but are by no means limited to, enhancing image quality to facilitate clearer visualization of intricate rock structures and refining the estimation of petrophysical properties with increased accuracy.},

To aid learning in this domain, we developed PyTutor, an innovative intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that is designed to assist beginners in Python programming. PyTutor utilizes the ChatGPT model to offer continuous guidance, problem-solving hints, and detailed code explanations. It features a structured hint system for each question, covering pseudocode, cloze, basic, and advanced coding solutions. In our 11-week experiment, we compared 35 students who used PyTutor with 36 students who did not. The results indicated the effectiveness of PyTutor, particularly for students with weak foundations in programming. Those with lower initial knowledge exhibited higher engagement, completion rates, and success rates in in-class and after-class programming exercises. Nevertheless, we observed a potential risk of overreliance on PyTutor among students, which may impede the development of independent problem-solving skills. Thus, we recommend the balanced usage of PyTutor. In conclusion, PyTutor is a valuable ITS in programming education that considerably improves the learning outcomes of beginners. Its tailored approach renders it a promising tool for bridging knowledge gaps and enhancing overall educational experiences in the field of programming.},

    abstract = {Background
In medical education, particularly in anatomy and dermatology, generative artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to create customized illustrations. However, the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in medical textbooks and elsewhere, which serve as training data for AI, poses a significant challenge in ensuring diverse and inclusive educational materials.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the extent of skin tone diversity in AI-generated medical images and to test whether the representation of skin tones can be improved by modifying AI prompts to better reflect the demographic makeup of the US population.
Methods
In total, 2 standard AI models (Dall-E [OpenAI] and Midjourney [Midjourney Inc]) each generated 100 images of people with psoriasis. In addition, a custom model was developed that incorporated a prompt injection aimed at “forcing” the AI (Dall-E 3) to reflect the skin tone distribution of the US population according to the 2012 American National Election Survey. This custom model generated another set of 100 images. The skin tones in these images were assessed by 3 researchers using the New Immigrant Survey skin tone scale, with the median value representing each image. A chi-square goodness of fit analysis compared the skin tone distributions from each set of images to that of the US population.
Results
The standard AI models (Dalle-3 and Midjourney) demonstrated a significant difference between the expected skin tones of the US population and the observed tones in the generated images (P<.001). Both standard AI models overrepresented lighter skin. Conversely, the custom model with the modified prompt yielded a distribution of skin tones that closely matched the expected demographic representation, showing no significant difference (P=.04).
Conclusions
This study reveals a notable bias in AI-generated medical images, predominantly underrepresenting darker skin tones. This bias can be effectively addressed by modifying AI prompts to incorporate real-life demographic distributions. The findings emphasize the need for conscious efforts in AI development to ensure diverse and representative outputs, particularly in educational and medical contexts. Users of generative AI tools should be aware that these biases exist, and that similar tendencies may also exist in other types of generative AI (eg, large language models) and in other characteristics (eg, sex, gender, culture, and ethnicity). Injecting demographic data into AI prompts may effectively counteract these biases, ensuring a more accurate representation of the general population.},

    abstract = {Background
Mental health issues among healthcare workers remain a serious problem globally. Recent surveys continue to report high levels of depression, anxiety, burnout and other conditions amongst various occupational groups. Novel approaches are needed to support clinician well-being.
Objective
This integrative literature review aims to explore the current state of research examining the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and machine learning (ML) systems to predict mental health issues and identify associated risk factors amongst healthcare professionals.
Methods
A literature search of databases was conducted in Medline then adapted as necessary to Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed and CINAHL with Full Text. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for the review.
Results
Nine studies employed various machine learning techniques to predict different mental health outcomes among healthcare workers. Models showed good predictive performance, with AUCs ranging from 0.82 to 0.904 for outcomes such as depression, anxiety and safety perceptions. Key risk factors identified included fatigue, stress, burnout, workload, sleep issues and lack of support. Two studies explored the potential of sensor-based technologies and GenAI analysis of physiological data. None of the included studies focused on the use of GenAI systems specifically for providing mental health support to healthcare workers.
Conclusion
Preliminary research demonstrates that AI/ML models can effectively predict mental health issues. However, more work is needed to evaluate the real-world integration and impact of these tools, including GenAI systems, in identifying clinician distress and supporting well-being over time. Further research should aim to explore how GenAI may be developed and applied to provide mental health support for healthcare workers.},

Treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) is particularly high stakes, requiring evidence-based clinical treatment, mental health expertise, and peer support. Thus, promises of AI systems addressing deficient healthcare resources and structural bias are relevant within this domain, especially in an anonymous setting. This study explores the effectiveness of generative AI in answering real-world substance use and recovery questions. We collect questions from online recovery forums, use ChatGPT and Meta's LLaMA-2 for responses, and have SUD clinicians rate these AI responses. While clinicians rated the AI-generated responses as high quality, we discovered instances of dangerous disinformation, including disregard for suicidal ideation, incorrect emergency helplines, and endorsement of home detox. Moreover, the AI systems produced inconsistent advice depending on question phrasing. These findings indicate a risky mix of seemingly high-quality, accurate responses upon initial inspection that contain inaccurate and potentially deadly medical advice. Consequently, while generative AI shows promise, its real-world application in sensitive healthcare domains necessitates further safeguards and clinical validation.},

The generated responses are evaluated for accuracy, relevance, and clarity. We find that ChatGPT outperforms Bard in overall accuracy (84.3% vs. 82.8%). This difference in performance suggests that ChatGPT could serve as a robotic advisor in transactional HR roles. In contrast, Bard may possess additional safeguards against misuse in the HR function, making it less capable of generating responses to certain types of questions. Statistical tests reveal that although the two systems differ in their mean accuracy, relevance, and clarity of the responses, the observed differences are not always statistically significant, implying that both tools may be more complementary than competitive. The Pearson correlation coefficients further support this by showing weak to non-existent relationships in performance metrics between the two tools. Confirmation queries don't improve ChatGPT or Bard's response accuracy.

    abstract = {Background
Reading medical papers is a challenging and time-consuming task for doctors, especially when the papers are long and complex. A tool that can help doctors efficiently process and understand medical papers is needed.
Objective
This study aims to critically assess and compare the comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in accurately and efficiently understanding medical research papers using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist, which provides a standardized framework for evaluating key elements of observational study.
Methods
The study is a methodological type of research. The study aims to evaluate the understanding capabilities of new generative artificial intelligence tools in medical papers. A novel benchmark pipeline processed 50 medical research papers from PubMed, comparing the answers of 6 LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-1106, PaLM 2, Claude v1, and Gemini Pro) to the benchmark established by expert medical professors. Fifteen questions, derived from the STROBE checklist, assessed LLMs’ understanding of different sections of a research paper.
Results
LLMs exhibited varying performance, with GPT-3.5-Turbo achieving the highest percentage of correct answers (n=3916, 66.9%), followed by GPT-4-1106 (n=3837, 65.6%), PaLM 2 (n=3632, 62.1%), Claude v1 (n=2887, 58.3%), Gemini Pro (n=2878, 49.2%), and GPT-4-0613 (n=2580, 44.1%). Statistical analysis revealed statistically significant differences between LLMs (P<.001), with older models showing inconsistent performance compared to newer versions. LLMs showcased distinct performances for each question across different parts of a scholarly paper—with certain models like PaLM 2 and GPT-3.5 showing remarkable versatility and depth in understanding.
Conclusions
This study is the first to evaluate the performance of different LLMs in understanding medical papers using the retrieval augmented generation method. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance medical research by improving efficiency and facilitating evidence-based decision-making. Further research is needed to address limitations such as the influence of question formats, potential biases, and the rapid evolution of LLM models.},

Existing literature shows that digital forensics using rsid requires access to multiple document versions or the user's machine. In cases of academic misconduct allegations usually only the submitted files are available for digital forensic examination, coupled with assertions by the alleged perpetrators about the document generation and editing process This paper represents a detailed exploratory study that provides educators and digital forensic scientists with tools to examine a single document for the veracity of various commonly asserted scenarios of document generation and editing. It is based on a series of experiments that ascertained whether and how common edit and document generation actions such as copy, paste, insertion of blocks of texts from other documents, leave tell-tale traces in the rsid encoding that is embedded in all MS Word documents. While digital forensics can illuminate document generation processes, the actions that led to these may have innocuous explanations. In consequence, this paper also provides academic misconduct investigators with a set of prompts to guide the interview with alleged perpetrators to glean the information required for cross-correlation with observations based on the rsid data.},

    abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools has given rise to a growing discussion of the potential challenges and benefits that the use of these technologies may present in the field of education. This study examines the acceptance of the use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning among primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong. It uses an extension of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with a modified framework that incorporates two key factors: self-efficacy and subjective norm. Data were collected from a sample of 367 primary and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong using questionnaires containing items for six constructs: self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, subjective norm, and behavioural intention. The results show that fostering teachers' self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and attitude is essential for successfully increasing their behavioural intention to use GenAI tools. Subjective norm was also found to influence teachers' behavioural intention. To enhance teachers' effective use of GenAI for teaching, teacher development programmes should focus on equipping teachers with comprehensive conceptual knowledge and skills and an understanding of the application of these tools to teaching and learning. Policy support to create a conducive environment for the use of GenAI in teaching and learning would also be beneficial. The study has theoretical implications in its extension of the TAM model as well as implications for enhancing teachers’ AI literacy and developing pedagogies for the meaningful use of GenAI tools for teaching and learning in K–12 settings.},

@article{ZHANG2024,
    abstract = {Background
Large language models (LLMs) can understand natural language and generate corresponding text, images, and even videos based on prompts, which holds great potential in medical scenarios. Orthopedics is a significant branch of medicine, and orthopedic diseases contribute to a significant socioeconomic burden, which could be alleviated by the application of LLMs. Several pioneers in orthopedics have conducted research on LLMs across various subspecialties to explore their performance in addressing different issues. However, there are currently few reviews and summaries of these studies, and a systematic summary of existing research is absent.
Objective
The objective of this review was to comprehensively summarize research findings on the application of LLMs in the field of orthopedics and explore the potential opportunities and challenges.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 1, 2014, to February 22, 2024, with the language limited to English. The terms, which included variants of “large language model,” “generative artificial intelligence,” “ChatGPT,” and “orthopaedics,” were divided into 2 categories: large language model and orthopedics. After completing the search, the study selection process was conducted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials and CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) guidance. Data extraction and synthesis were conducted after the quality assessment.
Results
A total of 68 studies were selected. The application of LLMs in orthopedics involved the fields of clinical practice, education, research, and management. Of these 68 studies, 47 (69%) focused on clinical practice, 12 (18%) addressed orthopedic education, 8 (12%) were related to scientific research, and 1 (1%) pertained to the field of management. Of the 68 studies, only 8 (12%) recruited patients, and only 1 (1%) was a high-quality randomized controlled trial. ChatGPT was the most commonly mentioned LLM tool. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition, measurement, and evaluation of the LLMs’ performance across the different studies. For diagnostic tasks alone, the accuracy ranged from 55% to 93%. When performing disease classification tasks, ChatGPT with GPT-4’s accuracy ranged from 2% to 100%. With regard to answering questions in orthopedic examinations, the scores ranged from 45% to 73.6% due to differences in models and test selections.
Conclusions
LLMs cannot replace orthopedic professionals in the short term. However, using LLMs as copilots could be a potential approach to effectively enhance work efficiency at present. More high-quality clinical trials are needed in the future, aiming to identify optimal applications of LLMs and advance orthopedics toward higher efficiency and precision.},

    abstract = {The emergence of ChatGPT in the broader field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked scholarly discourse on its utilization in various disciplines. Yet, a significant void exists in our understanding of the dynamics of consumer engagement with content creators producing ChatGPT-related content. Therefore, the present study aims to delineate how ChatGPT-related content garners consumer engagement on YouTube. Data from 100 YouTube videos amassing an aggregate of 65 million views on ChatGPT were extracted using three application programming interfaces (APIs), namely, VidIQ, Tubebuddy, and SocialBlade. We subsequently contrasted this dataset with data from 200 other videos produced by the same creators. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, multigroup SEM, and comparative line graphs. Employing the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) theoretical framework, our results indicate that innovative content such as ChatGPT-related videos garners more engagement than other content types from the same YouTube channels. Intriguingly, this study finds that ChatGPT-focused content exhibited diminished sensitivity to channel subscriber counts, with channels having fewer subscribers achieving higher viewership numbers. Furthermore, ChatGPT-related content induced a surge in new subscribers to the channel compared to the other content types. The present study pioneers the investigation of audience engagement with ChatGPT-related content by juxtaposing it with other content from the same YouTube channels. We also explicate the relationship between content sensitivity and extant subscriber counts. The present study provides vital insights and implications for a diverse audience, including content creators, developers of AI tools, advertisers, and content publishers.},

However, in most of the existing design courses, students often work in small groups and peer interactions are limited to group members, which limits the range and depth of knowledge exchange. To complement the group-based activities, this study designs and assesses an analytics-enhanced discussion forum for whole-class interactions. The forum adopts ontology-based recommender systems and anomaly detection techniques to tailor the threads and contents for individual students in a personalized way. This analytics-enhanced forum was implemented in a large-size undergraduate design course (n = 313), and data about student responses to this forum was compared with data from the previous year’s course that adopted a conventional forum (n = 280). From the statistical analysis, students learning with the analytics-enhanced forum demonstrated significantly higher degrees of design practices (specifically, empathize, define, ideate, and test), collaborative learning, and course satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of students’ focus-group interviews shows their perceived benefits and concerns of the analytics-enhanced forum. The study also suggests integrating generative artificial intelligence and large language models to support students’ design thinking and collaborative design.},

Different aspects are discussed, which include the multilayer, multicommodity, and multiobjective nature of the problems in the field. Time-dependent decisions and uncertainty in data are also aspects covered. The insights resulting from the discussion made are materialized in a general mathematical model that leverages the discrete capacitated facility location. This lays the ground for embedding logistics decisions like distribution, inventory, procurement, and production. Different mechanisms for hedging against uncertainty are then analyzed, which ultimately lead to show how a facility location model can be set at the core of supply chain risk analytics. Environmental and social concerns aligned with the triple bottom line concept are also covered. In particular, the role of facility location in reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain design is analyzed. Different sectors are discussed, including agro-food, energy, commercial industry, healthcare, and humanitarian operations. Several modern trends are highlighted. These include blockchain technology, data-driven decision-making, and the role of Big Data and generative Artificial Intelligence.},

    abstract = {Summary
Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively reshaping the way that researchers design and study highly complex systems. In this perspective, we introduce an engineering design methodology aimed at fostering creativity through “constructive dialogues with a generative AI” and exemplify its potential through a set of methodically developed case studies. This creativity promotion approach starts with computer-aided design (CAD) models of lattices, metamaterials, and architected materials, which are provided as initial inputs to a generative AI through a chat. Then, the conversation starts with researchers asking the generative AI to modify the provided CAD model images by incorporating new elements, placing them in quasi-real-life environments, or adapting the provided designs to the structures of new products. To illustrate the methodology, a varied set of selected case studies of constructive dialogues leading to highly innovative designs are provided, bridging the gap between tissue engineering scaffolds and building architectures, biohybrid materials and product design, and innovative structures and medical devices, to cite a few.},

The proposed framework is based on a fragment simulation mechanism and the combination of three different deep learning models that position, reconstruct, and post-process the fragment to obtain a ready-to-use reconstruction. The method is applied as a case-study to a dataset of six Italian Bronze and Early Iron Age burial contexts, including about 4000 complete vessels and over 400 actual fragments. The results are evaluated using statistical metrics and expert human evaluation, showing promising results. The proposed method is a positive application of generative artificial intelligence in archaeology and provides a solution to the use of fragments in the digital and computational analysis of ceramics.

    abstract = {People experience the world through multiple senses simultaneously, contributing to our sense of place. Prior quantitative geography studies have mostly emphasized human visual perceptions, neglecting human auditory perceptions at place due to the challenges in characterizing the acoustic environment vividly. Also, few studies have synthesized the two-dimensional (auditory and visual) perceptions in understanding human sense of place. To bridge these gaps, we propose a Soundscape-to-Image Diffusion model, a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) model supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to visualize soundscapes through the generation of street view images. By creating audio-image pairs, acoustic environments are first represented as high-dimensional semantic audio vectors. Our proposed Soundscape-to-Image Diffusion model, which contains a Low-Resolution Diffusion Model and a Super-Resolution Diffusion Model, can then translate those semantic audio vectors into visual representations of place effectively. We evaluated our proposed model by using both machine-based and human-centered approaches. We proved that the generated street view images align with our common perceptions, and accurately create several key street elements of the original soundscapes. It also demonstrates that soundscapes provide sufficient visual information places. This study stands at the forefront of the intersection between generative AI and human geography, demonstrating how human multi-sensory experiences can be linked. We aim to enrich geospatial data science and AI studies with human experiences. It has the potential to inform multiple domains such as human geography, environmental psychology, and urban design and planning, as well as advancing our knowledge of human-environment relationships.},

Unlike the passive models learned by generative AI systems, they must capture and control the sensory consequences of action. This allows embodied agents to intervene upon their worlds in ways that constantly put their best models to the test, thus providing a solid bedrock that is – we argue – essential to the development of genuine understanding.

    abstract = {Natural language processing, with parsing and generation, has a long tradition. Parsing has been easier to perform than a generation but with generative artificial intelligence (a.k.a Gen AI) and large language models (abbr. LLMs), this has changed. Generative artificial intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a large data set to create something in the genre of that data set. It can generate different outputs ranging from texts, audio, objects, pictures, and paintings to videos, but also synthetic data. LLMs use deep learning and deep neural networks to train on large text corpora for recognizing and generating texts. These models are based on massive data sets, collected from databases and the web. They use transformer models to detect how elements in sequences relate to each other. This provides context support. Two well-known large language models are the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, GPT, used in ChatGPT and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, BERT. Although LLMs have advantages, they have problems. This paper presents generative artificial intelligence and LLMs with benefits and drawbacks. Results from applying these models have shown that they can work well for accuracy in specificity, user personalization and human-computer communication but they may not provide acceptable, reliable and truthful results. For example, ethics, hallucinations and incorrect information, or misjudgments, are some major problems. The paper ends with future directions, research questions on LLMs, and recommendations.},

Many educators have expressed anxiety and hesitation when it comes to integrating GenAI in their teaching practices. Thus, recommendations and guidance from institutions are needed to support instructors in this new and emerging GenAI era. In response to this need, this study explores different U.S. universities' academic policies and guidelines regarding the use of GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching and learning, and from there, gains understanding of how these universities respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts. Data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines, and relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the U.S. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy. Most universities actively respond and provide diverse types of resources, such as syllabus templates, workshops, shared articles, and one-on-one consultations; focusing on a range of topics, namely general technical introduction, ethical concerns, pedagogical applications, preventive strategies, data privacy, limitations, and detective tools. The findings provide four practical pedagogical implications for educators when considering GenAI in teaching practices: 1) accepting GenAI presence, 2) aligning GenAI use with learning objectives, 3) evolving curriculum to prevent misuse of GenAI, and 4) adopting multifaceted evaluation strategies. For recommendations toward policy making, the article suggests two possible directions for the use of GenAI tools: 1) establishing discipline-specific policies and guidelines, and 2) managing students' sensitive information in a transparent and careful manner.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI), exemplified by the widely adopted ChatGPT, has garnered significant attention in recent years. Its application spans various health education domains, including pharmacy, where its potential benefits and drawbacks have become increasingly apparent. Despite the growing adoption of Gen-AI such as ChatGPT in pharmacy education, there remains a critical need to assess and mitigate associated risks. This review exploresthe literature and potential strategies for mitigating risks associated with the integration of Gen-AI in pharmacy education.
Aim
To conduct a scoping review to identify implications of Gen-AI in pharmacy education, identify its use and emerging evidence, with a particular focus on strategies which mitigate potential risks to academic integrity.
Methods
A scoping review strategy was employed in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Databases searched includedPubMed, ERIC [Education Resources Information Center], Scopus and ProQuestfrom August 2023 to 20 February 2024 and included all relevant records from 1 January 2000 to 20 February 2024 relating specifically to LLM use within pharmacy education. A grey literature search was also conducted due to the emerging nature of this topic. Policies, procedures, and documents from institutions such as universities and colleges, including standards, guidelines, and policy documents, were hand searched and reviewed in their most updated form. These documents were not published in the scientific literature or indexed in academic search engines.
Results
Articles (n = 12) were derived from the scientific data bases and Records (n = 9) derived from the grey literature. Potential use and benefits of Gen-AI within pharmacy education were identified in all included published articles however there was a paucity of published articles related the degree of consideration to the potential risks to academic integrity. Grey literature recordsheld the largest proportion of risk mitigation strategies largely focusing on increased academic and student education and training relating to the ethical use of Gen-AI as well considerations for redesigning of current assessments likely to be a risk for Gen-AI use to academic integrity.
Conclusion
Drawing upon existing literature, this review highlights the importance of evidence-based approaches to address the challenges posed by Gen-AI such as ChatGPT in pharmacy education settings. Additionally, whilst mitigation strategies are suggested, primarily drawn from the grey literature, there is a paucity of traditionally published scientific literature outlining strategies for the practical and ethical implementation of Gen-AI within pharmacy education. Further research related to the responsible and ethical use of Gen-AI in pharmacy curricula; and studies related to strategies adopted to mitigate risks to academic integrity would be beneficial.},

It recommends that guidelines for using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in mental health care must be established promptly. Currently, clinicians using chatbots without appropriate approval risk undermining legal protections for patients. This could harm the patient and undermine the standards of the profession, undermining trust in an area where human involvement in decision-making is critical. To explore these concerns, this paper is divided into three parts. First, it examines the needs of patients in mental health. Second, it explores the potential benefits of GenAI in mental health and highlights the risks of its use as it pertains to patient needs. Third, it notes the ethical and legal concerns around data use and medical liability that require careful attention. The impact of the European Union's (EU) Artificial Intelligence Act (AI-Act) is also considered. It will be seen that these laws are insufficient in the context of mental health. As such, the paper recommends that guidelines should be developed to help resolve the existing legal gaps until codified rules are established.},

    abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis, detection, and prognostics (DDP) for complex equipment prognostics and health management (PHM) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs. Equipment in industrial scenarios often operates in normal conditions, resulting in missing anomalies, limited failures, and incomplete degradation paths. Thus the limited information on the state of the equipment collected from sensor readings severely hinders the cognitive capabilities of discriminative artificial intelligence (AI) for PHM. Data augmentation and generation (DA&G) techniques, represented by generative AI, have shown great promise in overcoming the limitations of PHM application scenarios. Research on DA&G has yielded significant achievements, but a comprehensive review in the mechanical field is still lacking. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA&G techniques aimed at solving the DDP problems, which are divided into three categories insights of data, mechanism, and features. The data-based randomized approach applies controlled randomness for augmentation. The mechanism-based domain-specific techniques advocate for exploring relationships between the physical entity and monitoring data for generating by reasoned inference. The feature-based generative model aims to identify the latent space of data and subsequently resample it. Finally, the paper explores strategies for evaluating DA&G and provides a deep insight into the challenges and opportunities of DA&G techniques.},

    abstract = {Summary
The widespread use of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (known as ChatGPT) and other emerging technology that is powered by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has drawn attention to the potential ethical issues they can cause, especially in high-stakes applications such as health care, but ethical discussions have not yet been translated into operationalisable solutions. Furthermore, ongoing ethical discussions often neglect other types of GenAI that have been used to synthesise data (eg, images) for research and practical purposes, which resolve some ethical issues and expose others. We did a scoping review of the ethical discussions on GenAI in health care to comprehensively analyse gaps in the research. To reduce the gaps, we have developed a checklist for comprehensive assessment and evaluation of ethical discussions in GenAI research. The checklist can be integrated into peer review and publication systems to enhance GenAI research and might be useful for ethics-related disclosures for GenAI-powered products and health-care applications of such products and beyond.},

    abstract = {This research presents a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and design framework that integrates machine learning (ML) and optimisation methodologies to discover new concrete mixture designs. Unlike traditional ML models that predict based on existing data, this framework innovatively generates new concrete mix designs that meet specific requirements such as strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced embodied CO2. To propose a powerful and reliable generative AI model, several advanced ML algorithms were considered, e.g., CatBoost, XGBoost, and LGBM. These models were trained on a unique dataset consisting of 4,936 data points collected from five different batching plants and have not been published yet. Bayesian Optimisation was employed to fine-tune model hyperparameters, resulting in the most effective models attaining R2 values of 0.94 and 0.89 for raw and grouped data, respectively. To verify the trained generative AI model, a case study was conducted, in which the model was requested to provide designs of a mix with pre-determined strength and optimised cost and embodied CO2. The mix designs generated by the framework were successfully validated through experimental tests, corroborating the predictive outcomes. The research culminated in the development of a web application, a tool crafted to streamline the concrete mixture design and optimisation process. This generative AI design framework can be applied to many other aspects of material design and engineering problems.},

However, smart grids face critical communication bottlenecks due to the ever-increasing volume of data from distributed sensors. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically a type of pre-trained Foundation Model (FM) architecture suitable for time series data due to its efficiency and privacy-preserving properties. These GenAI models are distributed to agents, or data holders, empowering them to fine-tune the foundation model with their local datasets. By fine-tuning the foundation model, the updated model can produce synthetic data that mirrors real-world grid conditions. The server aggregates fine-tuned model from all agents and then generates synthetic data which considers all data collected in the grid. This synthetic data can be used to train global machine learning models for specific tasks like anomaly detection and energy optimization. Then, the trained task models are distributed to agents in the grid to leverage them. The paper highlights the advantages of GenAI for smart grid communication, including reduced communication burden, enhanced privacy through anonymized data transmission, and improved efficiency and scalability. By enabling a distributed and intelligent communication architecture, GenAI introduces a novel way for a more secure, efficient, and sustainable energy future.},

    abstract = {Introduction
The emergence and application of generative artificial intelligence/large language models (hereafter GenAI LLMs) have the potential for significant impact on the healthcare industry. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on GenAI LLMs in healthcare based on reliable data. This article aims to conduct an exploratory study of the application of GenAI LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in healthcare from the perspective of digital media (i.e., online news), including the application scenarios, potential opportunities, and challenges.
Methods
This research used thematic qualitative text analysis in five steps: firstly, developing main topical categories based on relevant articles; secondly, encoding the search keywords using these categories; thirdly, conducting searches for news articles via Google ; fourthly, encoding the sub-categories using the elaborate category system; and finally, conducting category-based analysis and presenting the results. Natural language processing techniques, including the TermRaider and AntConc tool, were applied in the aforementioned steps to assist in text qualitative analysis. Additionally, this study built a framework, using for analyzing the above three topics, from the perspective of five different stakeholders, including healthcare demanders and providers.
Results
This study summarizes 26 applications (e.g., provide medical advice, provide diagnosis and triage recommendations, provide mental health support, etc.), 21 opportunities (e.g., make healthcare more accessible, reduce healthcare costs, improve patients care, etc.), and 17 challenges (e.g., generate inaccurate/misleading/wrong answers, raise privacy concerns, lack of transparency, etc.), and analyzes the reasons for the formation of these key items and the links between the three research topics.
Conclusions
The application of GenAI LLMs in healthcare is primarily focused on transforming the way healthcare demanders access medical services (i.e., making it more intelligent, refined, and humane) and optimizing the processes through which healthcare providers offer medical services (i.e., simplifying, ensuring timeliness, and reducing errors). As the application becomes more widespread and deepens, GenAI LLMs is expected to have a revolutionary impact on traditional healthcare service models, but it also inevitably raises ethical and security concerns. Furthermore, GenAI LLMs applied in healthcare is still in the initial stage, which can be accelerated from a specific healthcare field (e.g., mental health) or a specific mechanism (e.g., GenAI LLMs’ economic benefits allocation mechanism applied to healthcare) with empirical or clinical research.},

    abstract = {Background
Those receiving the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) over the next ten years will predominantly be part of Generation Z (Gen Z). Recent observations within our clinic suggest that younger people with MS utilize online generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms for personalized medical advice prior to their first visit with a specialist in neuroimmunology. The use of such platforms is anticipated to increase given the technology driven nature, desire for instant communication, and cost-conscious nature of Gen Z. Our objective was to determine if ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) could diagnose MS in individuals earlier than their clinical timeline, and to assess if the accuracy differed based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Methods
People with MS between 18 and 59 years of age were studied. The clinical timeline for people diagnosed with MS was retrospectively identified and simulated using ChatGPT-3.5 (GPT-3.5). Chats were conducted using both actual and derivatives of their age, sex, and race/ethnicity to test diagnostic accuracy. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was estimated for time to diagnosis, clustered by subject. The p-value testing for differences in time to diagnosis was accomplished using a general Wilcoxon test. Logistic regression (subject-specific intercept) was used to capture intra-subject correlation to test the accuracy prior to and after the inclusion of MRI data.
Results
The study cohort included 100 unique people with MS. Of those, 50 were members of Gen Z (38 female; 22 White; mean age at first symptom was 20.6 years (y) (standard deviation (SD)=2.2y)), and 50 were non-Gen Z (34 female; 27 White; mean age at first symptom was 37.0y (SD=10.4y)). In addition, a total of 529 people that represented digital simulations of the original cohort of 100 people (333 female; 166 White; 136 Black/African American; 107 Asian; 120 Hispanic, mean age at first symptom was 31.6y (SD=12.4y)) were generated allowing for 629 scripted conversations to be analyzed. The estimated median time to diagnosis in clinic was significantly longer at 0.35y (95% CI=[0.28, 0.48]) versus that by ChatGPT at 0.08y (95% CI=[0.04, 0.24]) (p<0.0001). There was no difference in the diagnostic accuracy between ages and by race/ethnicity prior to the inclusion of MRI data. However, prior to including the MRI data, males had a 47% less likely chance of a correct diagnosis relative to females (p=0.05). Post-MRI data inclusion within GPT-3.5, the odds of an accurate diagnosis was 4.0-fold greater for Gen Z participants, relative to non-Gen Z participants (p=0.01) with the diagnostic accuracy being 68% less in males relative to females (p=0.009), and 75% less for White subjects, relative to non-White subjects (p=0.0004).
Conclusion
Although generative AI platforms enable rapid information access and are not principally designed for use in healthcare, an increase in use by Gen Z is anticipated. However, the obtained responses may not be generalizable to all users and bias may exist in select groups.},

The directed design and discovery of compounds with pre-determined properties is a long-standing challenge in materials research. We provide a perspective on progress toward achieving this goal using generative models for chemical compositions and crystal structures based on a set of powerful statistical techniques drawn from the artificial intelligence community. We introduce the central concepts underpinning generative models of crystalline materials. Coverage is provided of early implementations for inorganic crystals based on generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders through to ongoing progress involving autoregressive and diffusion models. The influence of the choice of chemical representation and the generative architecture is discussed, along with metrics for quantifying the quality of the hypothetical compounds produced. While further developments are required to enable realistic predictions drawn from richer structure and property datasets, generative artificial intelligence is already proving to be complementary to traditional materials design strategies.},

Using a resource-based view model, this study investigates the relationship between generative AI use and employees' competitive advantage, as well as the moderating role of perceived organization support. From an analysis of data from 264 employees from 200 organizations, it is found that work-related generative AI use has a positive effect on employee boundary spanning, which contributes to employee competitive advantage. Secondly, work-related generative AI use also has a positive effect on employee agility, including employee resilience and employee adaptability, which further contributes to employee competitive advantage. However, work-related generative AI use has a positive effect on employee proactivity, while the effect of employee proactivity on employee competitive advantage is not significant. Thirdly, perceived organizational support can enhance the effect between employee boundary spanning and employee competitive advantage. However, it is interesting to observe that perceived organizational support enhances the effect between employee adaptability and employee competitive advantage, while weakening the effect between employee proactivity and employee competitive advantage. It does not exert a moderating effect between employee resilience and employee competitive advantage. These findings can help deepen the current understanding of the relationship between generative AI use in the organization and employee competitive advantage, and provide suggestions for business managers on how to use generative AI to improve employee competitive advantage.},

@article{LI2024,
    abstract = {Background
The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, has added complexity and richness to the virtual environment by increasing the presence of AI-generated content (AIGC). Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.
Objective
This study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.
Methods
The study conducted a 2×2×2 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.
Results
As of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.
Conclusions
This study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users’ perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation. This highlights the need for more nuanced strategies for AIGC labels, necessitating further research.},

    abstract = {Since the development of open and low-cost generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the higher education community has witnessed high use of AI-generated texts in scholarly research and academic assignments, attracting ongoing debate about whether such practices constitute cheating. While scholars argue that integrating GenAI tools can enhance productivity, critics raise concerns about the negative effect of such integration on critical thinking (CrT). This study therefore proposed a framework for enhancing students’ CrT skills in synthesizing AI-generated information. The proposed framework is underpinned by various theoretical foundations, encompassing five interconnected step-wise phases (familiarizing, conceptualizing, inquiring, evaluating, and synthesizing). The study was conducted under two separate experiments. The first experiment (Study 1) validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework, providing CrT training to 179 postgraduate students. In the second study (n = 125), additional experiments were undertaken to confirm the effectiveness of the framework in different contexts. An experimental procedure involving pretest and posttest design was implemented wherein participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: experimental group 1 (exposed to our framework), experimental group 2 (exposed to an alternative self-regulated learning framework), and a control group (exposed to a non-structured framework). Results from Study 1 revealed that the framework enhances students’ CrT skills to synthesize AI-generated texts. However, these CrT skills manifested through various rigorous training aimed at reinforcing learning. While the proposed framework holds considerable value in cultivating CrT skills, significant differences arise across various personality traits. In Study 2, the framework proved to be effective in different contexts. However, it did not make a difference, particularly in its capacity to enhance students’ self-regulated learning compared to other frameworks. We discussed the implications of the findings and recommended it to educators seeking to prepare students for the challenges of the AI-driven knowledge economy.},

This study investigated the impact of GAI chatbots on elementary school English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' speaking skills, focusing on two interaction configurations—individual and paired. Eighty-five elementary school EFL learners participated in a three-week summer program, engaging in daily 45-min interactions with CoolE Bot. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) individual interaction with CoolE Bot (I-Bot group), (2) paired interaction with CoolE Bot (P-Bot group), and (3) interaction with teachers and peers in a conventional English classroom (No-Bot group). In each class, participants in the Bot group received worksheets with a topic, prompts, and vocabulary to guide their interactions with CoolE Bot, while those in the No-Bot group also received worksheets for comparable activities. Quantitative (English-speaking tests) and qualitative data (semi-structured interviews) were collected and analyzed. Results revealed that the I-Bot and P-Bot groups' post-test speaking skills were significantly higher than those of the No-Bot group. CoolE Bot significantly improved the speaking skills of EFL learners. Both individual and paired interactions with CoolE Bot demonstrated positive effects, with no significant differences between groups.

    abstract = {Background
Training in social-verbal interactions is crucial for medical first responders (MFRs) to assess a patient’s condition and perform urgent treatment during emergency medical service administration. Integrating conversational agents (CAs) in virtual patients (VPs), that is, digital simulations, is a cost-effective alternative to resource-intensive human role-playing. There is moderate evidence that CAs improve communication skills more effectively when used with instructional interventions. However, more recent GPT-based artificial intelligence (AI) produces richer, more diverse, and more natural responses than previous CAs and has control of prosodic voice qualities like pitch and duration. These functionalities have the potential to better match the interaction expectations of MFRs regarding habitability.
Objective
We aimed to study how the integration of GPT-based AI in a mixed reality (MR)–VP could support communication training of MFRs.
Methods
We developed an MR simulation of a traffic accident with a VP. ChatGPT (OpenAI) was integrated into the VP and prompted with verified characteristics of accident victims. MFRs (N=24) were instructed on how to interact with the MR scenario. After assessing and treating the VP, the MFRs were administered the Mean Opinion Scale-Expanded, version 2, and the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces questionnaires to study their perception of the voice quality and the usability of the voice interactions, respectively. Open-ended questions were asked after completing the questionnaires. The observed and logged interactions with the VP, descriptive statistics of the questionnaires, and the output of the open-ended questions are reported.
Results
The usability assessment of the VP resulted in moderate positive ratings, especially in habitability (median 4.25, IQR 4-4.81) and likeability (median 4.50, IQR 3.97-5.91). Interactions were negatively affected by the approximately 3-second latency of the responses. MFRs acknowledged the naturalness of determining the physiological states of the VP through verbal communication, for example, with questions such as “Where does it hurt?” However, the question-answer dynamic in the verbal exchange with the VP and the lack of the VP’s ability to start the verbal exchange were noticed. Noteworthy insights highlighted the potential of domain-knowledge prompt engineering to steer the actions of MFRs for effective training.
Conclusions
Generative AI in VPs facilitates MFRs’ training but continues to rely on instructions for effective verbal interactions. Therefore, the capabilities of the GPT-VP and a training protocol need to be communicated to trainees. Future interactions should implement triggers based on keyword recognition, the VP pointing to the hurting area, conversational turn-taking techniques, and add the ability for the VP to start a verbal exchange. Furthermore, a local AI server, chunk processing, and lowering the audio resolution of the VP’s voice could ameliorate the delay in response and allay privacy concerns. Prompting could be used in future studies to create a virtual MFR capable of assisting trainees.},

The development of the approach is based on a framework which results in a hybrid generative adversarial network (HGAN) that seamlessly integrates a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for generating images and a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for labelling images. From the results, it was found that this approach provided high-quality labelled images automatically, and using these images significantly improved the accuracy of the deep learning models for measuring cracks in SHCC. The F1 score and Intersection Over Union (IOU) for crack segmentation reached 0.982 and 0.980, respectively. This approach will significantly promote crack measurement for SHCC materials and structures.},

Recently, there has been a surge in the development of this technology. However, existing deep learning-based design methods for shear wall structures suffer from poor quality and usability issues. To address these challenges, this study proposes an intelligent design and optimization system for shear wall structures based on large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI). The system employs an LLM as the core controller, which interacts with engineers to interpret their language descriptions and translate them into executable computer code. Subsequently, the system utilizes the corresponding structural generation and optimization methods to accomplish intelligent design tasks automatically. Furthermore, the system incorporates such critical factors as the empirical rules, mechanical performance, and material consumption into the structural optimization process. A unique three-level, two-stage optimization method is constructed based on topology, pattern, and size to enhance the overall design quality. Being able to complete the entire workflow of architectural drawing processing, structural scheme generation, and analysis model establishment, the proposed system enables automated and efficient design of shear wall structures. Through the analysis and validation of multiple cases, it was demonstrated that this system can significantly speed up the design by approximately 30 times compared to that of traditional methods whilst ensuring the safety and cost-effectiveness of the design schemes. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights for the advancement of automated structural design undertakings.},

    abstract = {Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) exhibit excellent mechanical and energy absorption properties due to their structural advantages. However, existing porous TPMS structural design methods are constrained to a forward process from structural parameters to mechanical properties. This study proposed an inverse design method that combines bidirectional generative adversarial networks (BiGAN) and mechanical performance targets, resulting in a combined TPMS structure of Primitive and IWP types with superior buffering and energy absorption capabilities. The results show that under a single load value target condition of the designed structure, the minimum deviation index (R2) between the load value corresponding to the displacement point and the target load value is only 0.987, and the maximum mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is only 5.92 %. When considering the elastic modulus target, the approach successfully conducts two sets of combined structural designs meeting the requirements of both high and low elastic moduli. When targeting the specified load-displacement curve conditions, specifically when combining high elastic modulus with ascending plasticity, the designed structures exhibit an error of only 2.2 % compared to the target property. Moreover, the quasi-static uniaxial compression experiments conducted on additively manufactured designed structures confirm that the experimental curves match the target curves in terms of deformation trends and load value ranges. The success of this inverse design approach for cellular TPMS structures has the potential to expedite new structural material development processes.},

    abstract = {Background
Digital health has been taught at medical faculties for a few years. However, in general, the teaching of digital competencies in medical education and training is still underrepresented.
Objective
This study aims to analyze the objective acquisition of digital competencies through the implementation of a transdisciplinary digital health curriculum as a compulsory elective subject at a German university. The main subject areas of digital leadership and management, digital learning and didactics, digital communication, robotics, and generative artificial intelligence were developed and taught in a transdisciplinary manner over a period of 1 semester.
Methods
The participants evaluated the relevant content of the curriculum regarding the competencies already taught in advance during the study, using a Likert scale. The participants’ increase in digital competencies were examined with a pre-post test consisting of 12 questions. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student t test. A P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Furthermore, an analysis of the acceptance of the transdisciplinary approach as well as the application of an alternative examination method (term paper instead of a test with closed and open questions) was carried out.
Results
In the first year after the introduction of the compulsory elective subject, students of human medicine (n=15), dentistry (n=3), and medical biotechnology (n=2) participated in the curriculum. In total, 13 participants were women (7 men), and 61.1% (n=11) of the participants in human medicine and dentistry were in the preclinical study stage (clinical: n=7, 38.9%). All the aforementioned learning objectives were largely absent in all study sections (preclinical: mean 4.2; clinical: mean 4.4; P=.02). The pre-post test comparison revealed a significant increase of 106% in knowledge (P<.001) among the participants.
Conclusions
The transdisciplinary teaching of a digital health curriculum, including digital teaching methods, considers perspectives and skills from different disciplines. Our new curriculum facilitates an objective increase in knowledge regarding the complex challenges of the digital transformation of our health care system. Of the 16 student term papers arising from the course, robotics and artificial intelligence attracted the most interest, accounting for 9 of the submissions.},

    abstract = {Incorporating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), into educational settings presents valuable opportunities to boost the efficiency of educators and enrich the learning experiences of students. A significant portion of the current use of LLMs by educators has involved using conversational user interfaces (CUIs), such as chat windows, for functions like generating educational materials or offering feedback to learners. The ability to engage in real-time conversations with LLMs, which can enhance educators' domain knowledge across various subjects, has been of high value. However, it also presents challenges to LLMs' widespread, ethical, and effective adoption. Firstly, educators must have a degree of expertise, including tool familiarity, AI literacy and prompting to effectively use CUIs, which can be a barrier to adoption. Secondly, the open-ended design of CUIs makes them exceptionally powerful, which raises ethical concerns, particularly when used for high-stakes decisions like grading. Additionally, there are risks related to privacy and intellectual property, stemming from the potential unauthorised sharing of sensitive information. Finally, CUIs are designed for short, synchronous interactions and often struggle and hallucinate when given complex, multi-step tasks (e.g., providing individual feedback based on a rubric on a large scale). To address these challenges, we explored the benefits of transitioning away from employing LLMs via CUIs to the creation of applications with user-friendly interfaces that leverage LLMs through API calls. We first propose a framework for pedagogically sound and ethically responsible incorporation of GenAI into educational tools, emphasizing a human-centred design. We then illustrate the application of our framework to the design and implementation of a novel tool called Feedback Copilot, which enables instructors to provide students with personalized qualitative feedback on their assignments in classes of any size. An evaluation involving the generation of feedback from two distinct variations of the Feedback Copilot tool, using numerically graded assignments from 338 students, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of our approach. Our findings have significant implications for GenAI application researchers, educators seeking to leverage accessible GenAI tools, and educational technologists aiming to transcend the limitations of conversational AI interfaces, thereby charting a course for the future of GenAI in education.},

Objective
This paper explores the application of a commercially available generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) to the development of a digital health behavior change intervention designed to support patient engagement in a commercial digital diabetes prevention program.
Methods
We examined the capacity, advantages, and limitations of ChatGPT to support digital product idea conceptualization, intervention content development, and the software engineering process, including software requirement generation, software design, and code production. In total, 11 evaluators, each with at least 10 years of experience in fields of study ranging from medicine and implementation science to computer science, participated in the output review process (ChatGPT vs human-generated output). All had familiarity or prior exposure to the original personalized automatic messaging system intervention. The evaluators rated the ChatGPT-produced outputs in terms of understandability, usability, novelty, relevance, completeness, and efficiency.
Results
Most metrics received positive scores. We identified that ChatGPT can (1) support developers to achieve high-quality products faster and (2) facilitate nontechnical communication and system understanding between technical and nontechnical team members around the development goal of rapid and easy-to-build computational solutions for medical technologies.
Conclusions
ChatGPT can serve as a usable facilitator for researchers engaging in the software development life cycle, from product conceptualization to feature identification and user story development to code generation.

    abstract = {Outcomes
1. Gain familiarity with generative artificial intelligence and its applications to mental health. 2. Learn how to conduct empirical research in palliative care focused on the opinions of children's mental health professionals regarding artificial intelligence.
Key Message
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a tool in healthcare, with the potential to support grief counseling and legacy-building in families. The authors discuss new research on the intersection of AI with legacy-building among terminally ill parents for their children, and mental health experts' opinions about AI for children.
Importance
With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), opportunities exist to help terminally ill parents co-create legacies for children. However, the impact of such practices on children's well-being is unknown.
Objective(s)
Assess children's mental health professionals’ (CMHPs) opinions about psychological needs surrounding, and applications of AI for, children's coping with the loss of a parent.
Scientific Methods Utilized
Practicing CMHPs were approached via association listservs and targeted social media ads. Data from N=298 (69% male, 72% white, 26% Latine, 56% rural/underserved communities; 87% of study total) physicians, psychologists, social workers, hospital chaplains, and community health workers were analyzed.
Results
Among CMHPs, 54% engaged with families upon diagnosis of parental terminal illness, 34% believed anticipatory guidance about loss could begin at diagnosis, and 26% following parental death. Across 10 dimensions of childhood, Plackett-Luce Model rank-ordering revealed that: 1) children's premorbid exposure to traumatic events, 2) surviving caregiver presence, and 3) child age were important factors to consider in CMHP treatment decision-making. Regarding AI, 91% were frequent AI users (e.g., smart speakers) and 87% foresaw a role for generative AI (e.g., new audio, images, text, and videos based on someone's likeness) in supporting children's mental health. Opinions toward AI as a legacy-building tool varied: 47% denied its potential, 18% believed it could be introduced at parents’ diagnosis, and 20% during treatment. In an adjusted multivariable model of the timing of generative AI introduction, CMHPs who believed anticipatory guidance could be introduced earlier in terminal illness believed AI could also be introduced earlier (B=.39, SE=.06, t=6.3, p<.01).
Conclusion(s)
AI may become a legacy-building tool for terminally ill parents to support children prior to and following loss.
Impact
Research should explore the scope and impact that AI-generated content could have on children's mental health, grief, and long-term recovery.},

    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) techniques are commonly seen as an inductive learning procedure, typically involving the identification of patterns in a specific training dataset to make predictions in novel contexts. By doing so, the performance and generalizability of these techniques often rely on the quality and quantity of the available training data. However, gathering a diverse training dataset that captures multiple nuances of students’ reasoning poses challenges in educational settings due to resource constraints. We compared three data augmentation strategies to address this issue: collecting additional student data, utilizing chatbots to paraphrase existing responses, and prompting chatbots to generate synthetic responses. We found that leveraging data augmentation significantly improved ML model performance. In detail, combining authentic and/or paraphrased responses with chatbot responses yielded the best machine-human score agreements across various validation conditions. This data augmentation allowed us to expand our applied scoring rubric by introducing a more detailed categorization that better captured the level of causality in undergraduate chemistry students’ reasoning about reaction mechanisms. Together, these findings highlight effective possibilities for augmenting the size and heterogeneity of the training data to improve ML model performance and generalizability, introduce a more fine-grained categorization, and reduce human effort in data collection. In the future, these benefits may enhance the scalability of formative assessments that adaptively support students’ reasoning in postsecondary chemistry classes.},

The current study addresses this research gap by conducting and analyzing semi-structured, in-depth interviews with eleven high school teachers and sixteen high school students about their expectations for PAs' communication capabilities. The interviewees identified relational and task-related communication capabilities that a PA should perform to communicate effectively with students and scaffold their learning. PA communication that is simultaneously affirmative and relational can induce immediacy, foster the relationship and engagement with a PA, and support students' learning management. Additionally, the teachers and students described the activities and technological aspects that should be considered when designing conversational PAs. The study showed that teachers and students applied human-to-human communication scripts when outlining their desired PA communication characteristics. The study offers novel insights and recommendations to researchers and developers on the communicational, pedagogical, and technological aspects that must be considered when designing communicative PAs that scaffold students’ learning, and discusses the contributions on human–machine communication in education.},

Such a prediction can help educators to design effective learning activities by providing educational experiences that cater to students' different personality traits for specific learning objectives in the GenAI context. This study explored how variations in five representative personality traits affect students’ SRL performance when learning with ChatGPT. It used an explanatory approach based on structural equation modelling with a path analysis design. Four hundred and nine university students participated in the study and finished a self-reported questionnaire with validated items that are driven by previous studies. The results revealed that the personality traits of openness, extraversion, and agreeableness were significant predictors of all three stages of SRL; conscientiousness was a significant predictor of the forethought and self-reflection stages; and neuroticism failed to predict any of the three stages of SRL. These results may be attributable to the subjective nature of personality traits and the cognitive characteristics of SRL skills. The findings enrich the literature on SRL by introducing personality traits and GenAI as innovative perspectives and suggesting corresponding strategies for supporting different stages of SRL.},

In view of the foregoing, various facets like Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) are increasingly gaining popularity within oil and gas sector operations. Thus, we explored how GAI and ML algorithms can enhance oil and gas value chain productivity performance. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to identify significant GAI and MLA variables influencing performance in the oil and gas value chain, while Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to test regression equations related to their application. The study found that risk portfolios and profiles can be appraised throughout the value chain by effectively utilising GAI and ML algorithms in upstream, midstream and downstream undertakings. While these findings are noteworthy and have significant implications for current practice, the paper advocates that an array of digital technologies beyond GAI and ML can still be examined during future studies to demonstrate a holistic perspective on how digital transformation can be achieved across the energy sector value and project operations.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence tools and applications (GenAI) are being increasingly used in health care. Physicians, specialists, and other providers have started primarily using GenAI as an aid or tool to gather knowledge, provide information, train, or generate suggestive dialogue between physicians and patients or between physicians and patients’ families or friends. However, unless the use of GenAI is oriented to be helpful in clinical service encounters that can improve the accuracy of diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes, the expected potential will not be achieved. As adoption continues, it is essential to validate the effectiveness of the infusion of GenAI as an intelligent technology in service encounters to understand the gap in actual clinical service use of GenAI.
Objective
This study synthesizes preliminary evidence on how GenAI assists, guides, and automates clinical service rendering and encounters in health care The review scope was limited to articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals.
Methods
We screened and selected 0.38% (161/42,459) of articles published between January 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023, identified from PubMed. We followed the protocols outlined in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to select highly relevant studies with at least 1 element on clinical use, evaluation, and validation to provide evidence of GenAI use in clinical services. The articles were classified based on their relevance to clinical service functions or activities using the descriptive and analytical information presented in the articles.
Results
Of 161 articles, 141 (87.6%) reported using GenAI to assist services through knowledge access, collation, and filtering. GenAI was used for disease detection (19/161, 11.8%), diagnosis (14/161, 8.7%), and screening processes (12/161, 7.5%) in the areas of radiology (17/161, 10.6%), cardiology (12/161, 7.5%), gastrointestinal medicine (4/161, 2.5%), and diabetes (6/161, 3.7%). The literature synthesis in this study suggests that GenAI is mainly used for diagnostic processes, improvement of diagnosis accuracy, and screening and diagnostic purposes using knowledge access. Although this solves the problem of knowledge access and may improve diagnostic accuracy, it is oriented toward higher value creation in health care.
Conclusions
GenAI informs rather than assisting or automating clinical service functions in health care. There is potential in clinical service, but it has yet to be actualized for GenAI. More clinical service–level evidence that GenAI is used to streamline some functions or provides more automated help than only information retrieval is needed. To transform health care as purported, more studies related to GenAI applications must automate and guide human-performed services and keep up with the optimism that forward-thinking health care organizations will take advantage of GenAI.},

The increased technical complexity and expanded scale of data usage not only make it more difficult to regulate AI but also present challenges for the current legal system. This article, which takes ChatGPT's training data and working principles as a starting point, examines specific privacy risks, data leakage risks, and personal data risks posed by generative AI. It also analyzes the latest practices in privacy and personal data protection in China. This article finds that while China's governance on privacy and personal data protection takes a macro-micro integration approach and a private-and-public law integration approach, there are shortcomings in the legal system. Given that the current personal data protection system centered on individual control is unsuitable for the modes of data processing by generative AI, and that private law is insufficient in safeguarding data privacy, urgent institutional innovation is needed to achieve the objective of “trustworthy AI.”},

    abstract = {Introduction and objective
Generative artificial intelligence makes it possible to ask about medical pathologies in dialog boxes. Our objective was to analyze the quality of information about the most common urological pathologies provided by ChatGPT (OpenIA), BARD (Google), and Copilot (Microsoft).
Methods
We analyzed information on the following pathologies and their treatments as provided by AI: prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, urinary lithiasis, and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Questions in English and Spanish were posed in dialog boxes; the answers were collected and analyzed with DISCERN questionnaires and the overall appropriateness of the response. Surgical procedures were performed with an informed consent questionnaire.
Results
The responses from the three chatbots explained the pathology, detailed risk factors, and described treatments. The difference is that BARD and Copilot provide external information citations, which ChatGPT does not. The highest DISCERN scores, in absolute numbers, were obtained in Copilot; however, on the appropriacy scale it was noted that their responses were not the most appropriate. The best surgical treatment scores were obtained by BARD, followed by ChatGPT, and finally Copilot.
Conclusions
The answers obtained from generative AI on urological diseases depended on the formulation of the question. The information provided had significant biases, depending on pathology, language, and above all, the dialog box consulted.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial (IA) generativa permite preguntar, a través de los cuadros de diálogo, sobre patologías médicas. Nuestro objetivo fue analizar la calidad de la información acerca de las patologías urológicas más comunes en los chatbots ChatGPT de OpenIA, BARD de Google y Copilot de Microsoft.
Material y método
Se realizó un análisis de la información aportada por IA sobre las siguientes patologías y sus tratamientos: cáncer de próstata, cáncer renal, cáncer de vejiga, litiasis urinarias e hipertrofia benigna de próstata (HBP). A través de cuadros de diálogo se formularon preguntas estructuradas en inglés y en español, recopilando las respuestas para analizarlas posteriormente con cuestionarios DISCERN y sobre la idoneidad global de la respuesta. Los tratamientos quirúrgicos se realizaron con cuestionario de consentimiento informado.
Resultados
Las respuestas obtenidas a través de los tres chatbots explicaron la patología, detallaron los factores de riesgo y describieron los tratamientos. La diferencia radica en que BARD y Copilot aportan citas de información externa, algo que ChatGPT no realiza. Las puntuaciones DISCERN más altas, en números absolutos, se obtuvieron en Copilot; sin embargo, en la escala de idoneidad se objetivó que sus respuestas no fueron las más apropiadas. Las mejores puntuaciones de tratamientos quirúrgicos fueron obtenidas por BARD, seguido de ChatGPT y finalmente de Copilot.
Conclusiones
Las respuestas obtenidas de la IA generativa sobre enfermedades urológicas dependieron de la formulación de la pregunta. La información proporcionada presentó sesgos importantes, dependiendo de la patología, del idioma y, sobre todo, del cuadro de diálogo consultado.},

Utilizing generative artificial intelligence, we have developed a framework to swiftly evaluate the γ' solvus temperature and tailor Ni-based superalloys, accelerating the process of discovering Ni-based superalloys. Physics-informed artificial neural network emerged as the optimal choice for reverse engineering, outperforming other models with an R2 score of 0.917 and a mean absolute error of 15 K. In the reverse design process, 20,000 virtual alloy samples were generated based on divide-and-conquer variational autoencoder which divides the dataset into distinct clusters by K-means algorithm provides a structured representation of the alloy composition space, thereby facilitating a more nuanced understanding of its inherent complexities. In a specific alloy design example, 563 samples were identified through screening based on criteria like γ' solvus temperature, composition deviation index, price, and density. Thermodynamic calculations were used to further screen Ni-based superalloys with exceptional high-temperature properties. The showcase of BA alloy discovery through generative artificial intelligence demonstrates the potential of our research to steer the creation of novel compositions for Ni-based superalloys with outstanding high-temperature properties.},

To understand their emotional expressions in facing different shopping experience scenarios, this paper presents a sentiment analysis method that combines the e-commerce review keyword-generated image with a hybrid machine learning-based model, in which the Word2Vec-TextRank is used to extract keywords that act as the inputs for generating the related images by generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Subsequently, a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM) model is applied for sentiment classification of those keyword-generated images. For method validation, the data randomly comprised of 5000 reviews from Amazon have been analyzed. With superior keyword extraction capability, the proposed method achieves impressive results on sentiment classification with a remarkable accuracy of up to 97.13%. Such performance demonstrates its advantages by using the text-to-image approach, providing a unique perspective for sentiment analysis in the e-commerce review data compared to the existing works. Thus, the proposed method enhances the reliability and insights of customer feedback surveys, which would also establish a novel direction in similar cases, such as social media monitoring and market trend research.},

This study investigates the perceived effectiveness of concept explanations produced by GAI compared to those created by human teachers, focusing on programming concepts of sequence, selection, and iteration. The research also explores teachers' and students' ability to discern the source of these explanations. Participants included 11 teachers and 70 sixth-grade students who were presented with concept explanations created or generated by teachers and ChatGPT. They were asked to evaluate the helpfulness of the explanations and identify their source. Results indicated that teachers found GAI-generated explanations more helpful for sequence and selection concepts, while preferring teacher-created explanations for iteration (χ2(2, N = 11) = 10.062, p = .007, ω = .595). In contrast, students showed varying abilities to distinguish between AI-generated and teacher-created explanations across concepts, with significant differences observed (χ2(2, N = 70) = 22.127, p < .001, ω = .399). Notably, students demonstrated difficulty in identifying the source of explanations for the iteration concept (χ2(1, N = 70) = 8.45, p = .004, φ = .348). Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses revealed that teachers and students employed similar criteria for evaluating explanations but differed in their ability to discern the source. Teachers focused on pedagogical effectiveness, while students prioritized relatability and clarity. The findings highlight the importance of considering both teachers' and students' perspectives when integrating GAI into computer science education. The study proposes strategies for designing GAI-based explanations that cater to learners' needs and emphasizes the necessity of explicit AI literacy instruction. Limitations and future research directions are discussed, underlining the need for larger-scale studies and experimental designs that assess the impact of GAI on actual learning outcomes.},

We argue that this narcissistic blow has a potentially dramatic influence on perceptions of human society, interrelationships, and the self. We should, accordingly, expect dramatic changes in perceptions of the therapeutic act following the emergence of what we term the artificial third in the field of psychotherapy. The introduction of an artificial third marks a critical juncture, prompting us to ask the following important core questions that address two basic elements of critical thinking, namely, transparency and autonomy: (1) What is this new artificial presence in therapy relationships? (2) How does it reshape our perception of ourselves and our interpersonal dynamics? and (3) What remains of the irreplaceable human elements at the core of therapy?

    abstract = {Aim
The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process.
Background
The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation.
Design
Discussion paper.
Methods
We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results.
Results
In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association – International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases.
Conclusions
Using Generative Pre-training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time-efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical-thinking and fact-checking.},

    abstract = {The increasing interest in the potential applications of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models like ChatGPT in health care has prompted numerous studies to explore its performance in various medical contexts. However, evaluating ChatGPT poses unique challenges due to the inherent randomness in its responses. Unlike traditional AI models, ChatGPT generates different responses for the same input, making it imperative to assess its stability through repetition. This commentary highlights the importance of including repetition in the evaluation of ChatGPT to ensure the reliability of conclusions drawn from its performance. Similar to biological experiments, which often require multiple repetitions for validity, we argue that assessing generative AI models like ChatGPT demands a similar approach. Failure to acknowledge the impact of repetition can lead to biased conclusions and undermine the credibility of research findings. We urge researchers to incorporate appropriate repetition in their studies from the outset and transparently report their methods to enhance the robustness and reproducibility of findings in this rapidly evolving field.},

    abstract = {This article examines the transformation of design work under the influence of managerialism and the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Drawing on John Maynard Keynes’s projections of technological unemployment and the evolving nature of work, it argues that despite advancements in automation, work has not diminished but rather devalued. Design, understood as a type of knowledge work, faces an apparent existential crisis. GenAI grows adept at mimicking the output of creative processes. The article explores how the fear of the end of design work fueled by the rise of GenAI is rooted in a misunderstanding of design work. This misunderstanding is driven by managerialism—an ideology that prioritizes efficiency and quantifiable outcomes over the intrinsic value of work. Managerialism seeks to instrumentalize and automate design, turning it into a controllable procedure to generate quantifiable creative outputs. The article argues why design work cannot be turned into a procedure and automated using GenAI. Advocates of these systems claim they enhance productivity and open new opportunities. However, evidence so far shows that flawed GenAI models produce disappointing outcomes while operating at a significant environmental cost. The article concludes by arguing for a robust theory of design—one that acknowledges the unique ontological and epistemic boundaries of design work and underscores why design cannot be reduced to a procedural output.},

Findings reveal teacher provided WCF typically involves a consistent combination of direct correction and indirect feedback forms addressing both local and global issues, albeit with a degree of inaccuracy. ChatGPT-assisted WCF tends to be in the form of metalinguistic feedback and/or reformulation of the original text.

Three groups of Chinese undergraduate students were recruited: a control group (CG, N = 33) and two experimental groups (EG1, N = 33; EG2, N = 33). The CG interacted with the teacher and classmates during the speaking class. In contrast, EG1 interacted with a text- and voice-based conversational GenAI chatbot called Typebot, while EG2 engaged with a conversational GenAI chatbot that featured both text and voice interaction along with human-like avatars named D-ID Agent. Quantitative analysis using multilevel modelling revealed that EG2 showed significant improvements in WTC and SPCC and a notable reduction in FLSA levels compared to CG. However, the pre- and post-speaking test results showed no significant differences in speaking performance across the groups. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews supported these findings, highlighting the immersive learning experience and emotional support provided by the human-like avatars. These results suggest that visually embodied GenAI chatbots can effectively enhance the emotional experience during the language learning.

A study conducted by researchers at a leading university in Australia surveyed 30 of their teaching staff, drawn predominantly from their teaching academy, and interviewed eight of them regarding the impact of AI on HE. Data were analyzed using the procedures of Inductive Thematic Analysis and revealed a lack of any homogenous sentiment around AI in HE and much ambiguity regarding best practice regarding recent technological developments. The results indicate concerns exist around concepts relating to academic integrity, however, these concerns may be exaggerated. Almost half of the participants indicated they were using AI within their teaching roles with the most common design change being modifications to assessments. Less than a quarter of staff agreed the university has adequately equipped them for AI, and more than three quarters indicated they would like support. They unanimously assumed the technology will improve. Keeping in mind universities’ obligation to serve students by preparing them for industry, it is vitally important that the HE sector stays informed of developments in AI and commit to ongoing research and discussions regarding best practice in response to AI.

How can this ‘generative AI’ be compared with the ‘real’ intelligence of the human brain, when for example a human generates a whole memory in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, and then generates further prospective thoughts? Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places. This comparison with generative memory and processing in the human brain has interesting implications for the further development of generative AI and for neuroscience research.},

    abstract = {Aim
The use of neural networks (NNs) is spreading to all areas of life, and Ecology is no exception. However, the data-hungry nature of NNs can leave out many small, valuable datasets. Here we show how to apply transfer learning to rescue small datasets that can be invaluable in understanding patterns of species co-occurrence.
Location
Semiarid plant communities in Spain and México.
Time period
2016–2022.
Major taxa studied
Angiosperms.
Methods
Based on a large sample of plant species co-occurrence in vegetation patches in a semi-arid area of eastern Spain, we fit a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model that correctly reproduces which species live with which in these patches. Subsequently, we train the same type of model on two communities for which we only have smaller datasets (another semi-arid community in eastern Spain, and a tropical community in Mexico).
Results
When we transfer the knowledge learnt from the large dataset directly to the other two, the predictions improve for the community more similar to our reference one. As for the more dissimilar community, improving the accuracy of the transfer requires a further tuning of the model to the local data. In particular, the knowledge transferred relates primarily to species frequency and, to a lesser extent, to their phylogenetic relationships, which are known to be determinants of species interaction patterns.
Main conclusions
This AI-based approach can be performed for communities similar or not so similar to the reference community, opening the door to systematic transfer learning for accurate predictions on small datasets. Interestingly, this transfer operates by matching unrelated species between the origin and target datasets, implying that arbitrary datasets can then be transferred to, or even combined in order to augment each other, irrespective of the species involved, potentially allowing such models to be applied to a wide range of plant communities in different climates.},

    abstract = {The potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in language education has been widely recognized. However, there has been limited attention given to the emotional experiences of language teachers using AI and its relationship with AI-enabled productivity. By investigating 1,683 pre-service language teachers’ experiences of using generative AI in their teaching practicum or learning, this study explored how teachers’ emotional responses to AI use in teaching and learning are related to their AI-enabled productivity through the mediation of appraisal and coping. We uncovered several key findings: (1) achievement, challenge, and loss emotions were directly and/or indirectly related to AI-enabled productivity, while deterrence emotions were not; (2) achievement and challenge emotions were positively correlated with challenge appraisal and negatively correlated with hindrance appraisal, whereas loss and deterrence emotions showed the opposite pattern of correlation; (3) challenge emotions were positively related to approach-oriented coping, while loss and deterrence emotions were positively associated with avoidance-oriented coping; (4) among the coping strategies, only positive reinterpretation was positively associated with AI-enabled productivity; and (5) challenge appraisal and positive reinterpretation were significant mediators in the relationships between emotions and AI-enabled productivity, either separately or sequentially. These findings provide valuable insights for future research and practice, aiming to support the application of generative AI in the context of language education.},

    abstract = {This paper examines how Chinese university students negotiate their second language (L2) motivational dynamics, including their ideal and ought-to L2 selves, to participate in informal digital learning of English (IDLE) mediated by generative artificial intelligence (AI). It demonstrates the extent to which enjoyment, the most observable positive emotion in L2 learning, influences their involvement in AI-mediated IDLE (AI-IDLE) activities. Employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design, this study surveyed 690 Chinese undergraduate students and conducted 12 post-survey interviews. Using a structural equation modeling approach, the quantitative analysis reveals that participants’ ideal L2 self can significantly predict both their sense of enjoyment and AI-IDLE, while the ought-to L2 self is only able to directly predict enjoyment. The quantitative results also demonstrate that enjoyment can partially mediate the relationship between the ideal L2 self and AI-IDLE and simultaneously fully channel the indirect impact of the ought-to L2 self on AI-IDLE. Supplementing these quantitative findings, the interview data provides a nuanced understanding of how motivation and enjoyment shift and interact with learning contexts as participants engage in AI-IDLE. Drawing on these quantitative and qualitative insights, this study identifies implications for pedagogy, particularly in terms of motivating Chinese university students to engage in IDLE while maintaining emotional well-being in the age of generative AI.},

@article{SHASTRI20247668,
    abstract = {Introduction: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited condition that reduces life expectancy and has a profound impact on quality of life. Assessment of social media conversations in the SCD community in the UK highlighted health inequities, including issues with access to emergency care, low levels of healthcare professional empathy, and racial bias/stigmatization (Shastri O, et al. ASH 2023; abstract 1057). This emphasizes the urgent unmet need for additional education. Use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to facilitate the development of medical content, including plain language summaries (PLS) of research may increase efficiency, reduce resource cost and ultimately improve accessibility to educational information across a range of audiences. We assessed the ability of GenAI to develop a PLS of our social media listening study. Methods: We developed 3 written versions of a PLS of this study: human-written by a medical writer, AI-generated, and hybrid AI-human, where a person living with SCD edited the AI version for readability. Each was ~300-400 words and with a target reading age of 12 years. The AI PLS was developed using Pfizer's GenAI tool, MAIA (Medical AI assistant). A video version of each written PLS was developed using the AI tool, Synthesia. People with SCD and their carers (≥18 years of age) were recruited via telephone to complete an online survey to assess the understandability of the 3 written PLS and preference for written versus video PLS. Participants were presented with 1 of the 3 written PLS at random and asked to assess how easily they understood it on a 5-point scale (1=very difficult; 2=difficult; 3=neither difficult nor easy; 4=easy; 5=very easy). They were then asked 3 multiple-choice questions to gauge their understanding. Participants then rated the other 2 written PLS and were asked to rank all 3 in order of most easily understood. Finally, participants watched the video version of their top-rated written PLS and stated which format they preferred. Participants were blinded to PLS source. The Flesch-Kincaid calculator (https://goodcalculators.com/flesch-kincaid-calculator/) was used to provide an objective measure of readability for each PLS. Results: Of 93 participants, there were 88 living with SCD and 5 caring for someone with SCD. The AI versions of the PLS achieved similar scores for understandability to the human-written version: mean ± standard deviation understandability scores were 4.1 ± 0.9 (human), 4.0 ± 0.9 (AI), and 3.9 ± 0.8 (AI-hybrid). Overall, 81% of participants identified the human PLS as easy or very easy to read, similar to 76% for the AI PLS, and 74% for the AI-hybrid PLS. Overall, 41 participants (44%) ranked the human PLS in first place for understandability, 31 (33%) the AI PLS, and 21 (23%) the AI-hybrid PLS. For the multiple-choice questions, results were similar regardless of which PLS participants saw first, with over 85% correctly identifying the main findings of the study and the conclusions of the author; however, 63% incorrectly thought the data on which the PLS was based were obtained from interviewing people affected by SCD rather than social media listening. Fifty-four participants (58%) preferred the video PLS over the written PLS, 27 participants (29%) preferred the written PLS and 12 (13%) had no preference. Flesch-Kincaid scores for the three PLS were as follows: human (reading ease score, 62; reading level, 8th to 9th grade); AI (reading ease score, 58; reading level, 10th to 12th grade); AI-hybrid (reading ease score, 63; reading level, 8th to 9th grade). Conclusion: There is a clear need for additional resources and education in SCD, which may be supported by the development of PLS. The limited studies that have assessed the capabilities of AI to generate PLS to date have focussed on clinical research. We have now expanded this to assess use of AI to develop PLS from a social media listening study that evaluated real-world experiences of the UK SCD community. Our study suggests that GenAI can generate PLS that are as informative as conventional, human-written PLS, and achieve similar readability scores as judged by people living with SCD in the UK (mean 4.1 for human-written, 4.0 for AI and 3.9 for AI-hybrid). We propose that GenAI may offer an alternative to conventional human-written PLS, providing a time- and resource-efficient solution to increase accessibility to educational resources.},

@article{HUDON2024,
    abstract = {Background
Undergraduate medical studies represent a wide range of learning opportunities served in the form of various teaching-learning modalities for medical learners. A clinical scenario is frequently used as a modality, followed by multiple-choice and open-ended questions among other learning and teaching methods. As such, script concordance tests (SCTs) can be used to promote a higher level of clinical reasoning. Recent technological developments have made generative artificial intelligence (AI)–based systems such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) available to assist clinician-educators in creating instructional materials.
Objective
The main objective of this project is to explore how SCTs generated by ChatGPT compared to SCTs produced by clinical experts on 3 major elements: the scenario (stem), clinical questions, and expert opinion.
Methods
This mixed method study evaluated 3 ChatGPT-generated SCTs with 3 expert-created SCTs using a predefined framework. Clinician-educators as well as resident doctors in psychiatry involved in undergraduate medical education in Quebec, Canada, evaluated via a web-based survey the 6 SCTs on 3 criteria: the scenario, clinical questions, and expert opinion. They were also asked to describe the strengths and weaknesses of the SCTs.
Results
A total of 102 respondents assessed the SCTs. There were no significant distinctions between the 2 types of SCTs concerning the scenario (P=.84), clinical questions (P=.99), and expert opinion (P=.07), as interpretated by the respondents. Indeed, respondents struggled to differentiate between ChatGPT- and expert-generated SCTs. ChatGPT showcased promise in expediting SCT design, aligning well with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, albeit with a tendency toward caricatured scenarios and simplistic content.
Conclusions
This study is the first to concentrate on the design of SCTs supported by AI in a period where medicine is changing swiftly and where technologies generated from AI are expanding much faster. This study suggests that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool in creating educational materials, and further validation is essential to ensure educational efficacy and accuracy.},

    abstract = {Aim
The aim of this paper is to investigate the incorporation of visual narratives, such as comics and graphics, into nursing education using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models like DALL-E.
Background
Visual narratives serve as a powerful method for communicating intricate concepts in nursing education. Despite their advantages, challenges in creating effective educational comics persist due to the need for expertise in graphic design and the associated time and resource constraints.
Design
This study examines existing literature that highlights the efficacy of visual narratives in education and demonstrates the potential of GAI models, specifically DALL-E, in creating visual narratives for nursing education.
Methods
We analyze the potential of GAI models, specifically DALL-E, to create visual narratives for educational purposes. This was demonstrated through illustrative examples addressing sensitive topics, illustrating research methodology and designing recruitment posters for clinical trials. Additionally, we discussed the necessity of reviewing and editing the text generated by DALL-E to ensure its accuracy and relevance in educational contexts. The method also considered legal concerns related to copyright and ownership of the generated content, highlighting the evolving legal landscape in this domain.
Results
The study found that GAI, specifically DALL-E, has significant potential to bridge the gap in creating visual narratives for nursing education. While offering cost-effectiveness and accessibility, GAI tools require careful consideration of challenges such as text-related errors, misinterpretation of user prompts and legal concerns.
Conclusions
GAI models like DALL-E offer promising solutions for enhancing visual storytelling in nursing education. However, their effective integration requires a collaborative approach, where educators engage with these tools as co-pilots, leveraging their capabilities while mitigating potential drawbacks. By doing so, educators can harness the full potential of GAI to enrich the educational experience for learners through compelling visual narratives.},

Relying on IS theories to build a stimulus-organism-response model, the authors tested a model using PLS-SEM with data from 393 ChatGPT users. The results show that user competence and autonomy dramatically increase a user's trust in ChatGPT, and trust improves hedonic value (HV), utilitarian value (UV), value-in-use, perceived task-technology fit (TTF), information accuracy, knowledge acquisition, perceived informativeness, and user satisfaction. In addition to trust, user satisfaction depends on HV, UV, and TTF. The sustainability use of ChatGPT depends on HV and satisfaction. However, perceived privacy concerns, perceived privacy risks, and privacy awareness do not affect consumer trust. There is a complete mediation between trust and sustainability, as well as HV and sustainability.},

Disinformation causes confusion, division between groups and undermines trust institutions to create societal chaos and destabilization. In an era of hyperconnectivity, GenAI can weaponize social media platforms that rapidly disseminate information without verifying the authenticity of content, creating new threats and vulnerabilities. But even as GenAI has emerged as a powerful tool in shaping society, disinformation threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations remain underexplored. This chapter investigates the burgeoning threat posed by GenAI as a potential weapon of mass destruction within the domain of disinformation. Through a comprehensive analysis of its threats and vulnerabilities, including content manipulation, targeted dissemination, and the creation of deepfakes, this study elucidates how GenAI could impair decision-making in human–machine teams, polarize societies, and destabilize geopolitical landscapes. Furthermore, this chapter explores potential countermeasures and mitigations, emphasizing the critical need for improved governance and regulatory frameworks. Applying these mitigations may help to reduce the pernicious influence of GenAI-driven disinformation and to preserve societal resilience against its malevolent applications.},

    abstract = {The research aims to understand Alzheimer’s genetic and immune landscapes using the amalgamation of three technologies: artificial intelligence (GenAI), integrative bioinformatics, and single-cell analysis. First, the study aims to identify and characterize the significant genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using three GenAI models (GPT‑4o, Gemini model, and DeepSeek). After the genes were accumulated from GenAI models, 27 genes associated with AD were recoded. Furthermore, they were analyzed using integrative bioinformatics methods. Similarly, the immune landscape of AD using single-cell analysis was also explored, which reveals a high percentage of effector CD8+ T cells (33.42%) and naive T cells (45.95%). The single-cell study found that effector memory T cells have two subsets. It also found that the macrophage population has started to spread and dendritic cells have decreased in Alzheimer’s patients. The single-cell gene expression study reveals the top ten highly expressed genes (NDUFV2, CAT, MRPS34, PBX3, THOC2, CCDC57, PBXIP1, SDHAF3, PPP4C, and MAP3K8). The clonal frequency indicates that CD8+ T and naive T cell populations show the highest clonal frequency in healthy and AD individuals and are further noted them in the clonotype cell proportion study. Following our GenAI and single-cell profiling strategy, future studies will help in quickly understanding the genetic and immune basis of many diseases.},

    abstract = {Background
The potential application of cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence chatbots in the capacity of emergency consultants is gaining growing attention. This study aimed to analyse the quality of advice on first aid for seizures generated by a commercially developed chatbot in comparison with its customised version.
Methods
The baseline version of ChatGPT (model GPT-4o) and the same chatbot customised using a specialised knowledge base and prompt engineering were tested in four scenarios mimicking bystander requests for instructions on how to help a victim with seizures. The scenarios included ongoing seizures and postictal states, with or without consciousness and breathing. A checklist-based evaluation was conducted.
Results
In total, 120 user-to-chatbot dialogues were generated (2 chatbots × 15 dialogues × 4 scenarios). The baseline chatbot always failed to consider the victim’s state, including whether the seizures are continuing, or if the victim in the postictal period is conscious and breathing normally. Its advice was non-selective and inaccurate, with frequent omissions of key recommendations on first aid and suggestions of inadequate measures. The customised chatbot-generated guidance was consistently tailored to the victim’s condition, significantly more precise and completely safe. Depending on the scenario, the mean percentage of chatbot responses that fulfilled the checklist items was 14–49 % for the baseline chatbot and 77–92 % for the customised version (p ≤ 0.039).
Conclusions
Whereas the publicly available version of the chatbot is not acceptable for first aid counselling, its expert-informed customisation ensures high accuracy and safety of generated advice. Further research in this field is advisable.},

@article{GARCIASANCHEZ2025,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) leverages large language models (LLMs) that are transforming health care. Specialized ambient GenAI tools, like Nuance Dax, Speke, and Tandem Health, “listen” to consultations and generate clinical notes. Medical-focused models, like Med-PaLM, provide tailored health care insights. GenAI’s capability to summarize complex data and generate responses in various conversational styles or literacy levels makes it particularly valuable since it has the potential to alleviate the burden of clinical documentation on health care professionals (HCPs). While GenAI may prove to be helpful, offering novel benefits, it comes with its own set of challenges. The quality of the source data can introduce biases, leading to skewed recommendations or outright false information (so-called hallucinations). In addition, due to the conversational nature of chatbot responses, users may be susceptible to misinformation, posing risks to both safety and privacy. Therefore, careful implementation and rigorous oversight are essential to ensure accuracy, ethical integrity, and alignment with clinical standards. Despite these advances, currently, no review has investigated HCPs’ experiences and opinions about GenAI in clinical documentation. Yet, such a perspective is crucial to better understand how these technologies can be safely and ethically adopted and implemented in clinical practice.
Objective
We aim to present the protocol for a scoping review exploring HCPs’ experiences and opinions about GenAI and ambient scribes in clinical documentation.
Methods
This scoping review will be carried out following the methodological framework of Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews) checklist. Relevant papers will be searched for in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The review will include studies published between January 2023 and September 2025. Studies will be included that represent original peer-reviewed work that explores HCPs’ experiences and opinions about the use of GenAI or ambient scribes for clinical documentation. Data extraction will include publication type, country, sample characteristics, clinical setting, study aim, study design, research question, and key findings. Study quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.
Results
The results will be presented as a narrative synthesis structured along the key themes of the evidence mapped. Data will be collated and presented in charts and tabular format. Findings will be reported in a peer-reviewed scoping review.
Conclusions
This will be the first scoping review that considers HCPs’ experiences and opinions about GenAI and ambient scribes in clinical documentation. The results will clarify how HCPs use—or avoid using—GenAI in daily health care work. This insight will help address perceived benefits, risks, expectations, and uncertainties. It may also reveal key research gaps in the field.

    abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the feasibility, usability, and efficacy of innovative generative pretrained transformer chatbot in improving self-care in hypertensive patients in a resource-limited setting.
Patients and Methods
A single-arm nonblinded clinical trial was deployed in a busy cardiology clinic in a low-resource setting. Artificial intelligence–enabled chatbot (Healthy Heart Assistant) was activated in smartphones of 50 adults on treatment for hypertension. Participants were trained on how to use the Healthy Heart Assistant including setting medication and appointment reminders. Baseline questionnaires were administered at enrollment and 30 days later to explore acceptability, feasibility and usability of the bot. We used chatbot usability questionnaire and self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire to assess bot usability and patients’ satisfaction, respectively. The study began on April 5, 2024, through July 15, 2024.
Results
Of 200 hypertensive clinic attendees, 70 (35%) had internet-enabled bot-compatible cell phones, of which 50 hypertensive patients were recruited to participate in the study. Among 50 participants, 2 (4%) were lost to follow-up; 19 (39.6%) were women; and 40 (83.3%) had attained tertiary level of education. Mean time of training to use bot was 5.7 minutes, with 35 (70.8%) of participants being able to use the bot within 5 minutes. The median frequency of chats for participants within the timeframe was an average of 1.5 chats/day. Chatbot usability questionnaire score was 69.5%, whereas self-made Healthy Heart Assistant satisfaction questionnaire score was 90%.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study shows that generative artificial intelligence can be applied with reasonable success in hypertension self-care in low-resource settings and has potential for being effective.},

This study explores how students assess ChatGPT's affordances and limitations in academic writing and how these assessments relate to their writing performance, judged by themselves and the course instructor. The study uniquely focuses on international pre-service teachers in a Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages program in the United States (N = 38), who may use generative AIs in their teaching and studies. The participants completed tasks in an applied linguistics class, including writing essays with and without ChatGPT on the same topic and comparing the two essays. Grounded in the Theory of Affordance, the students' evaluations were coded and analyzed with Epistemic Network Analysis. Results showed that students viewed ChatGPT's affordances and limitations differently according to their writing profiles. Those with lower writing scores or confidence were less critical of ChatGPT, highlighting its merits in language-related elements such as grammatical accuracy and lexical choice. The study suggests the importance of assisting future language teachers in fostering accurate knowledge of AI's affordances and developing balanced views towards AI through professional development, while considering individual differences in their needs and abilities.},

This white paper explores the impact of LLMs on radiology education, highlighting their potential to enrich curriculum development, teaching and learning, and learner assessment. Despite these advantages, the implementation of LLMs presents challenges, including limits on accuracy and transparency, the risk of misinformation, data privacy issues, and potential biases, which must be carefully considered. We provide recommendations for the successful integration of LLMs and LLM-based educational tools into radiology education programs, emphasizing assessment of the technological readiness of LLMs for specific use cases, structured planning, regular evaluation, faculty development, increased training opportunities, academic-industry collaboration, and research on best practices for employing LLMs in education.},

With the visual pedagogical scaffold, for instance, mind maps, learners can externalize their comprehension and engage in meaning negotiation. However, given the limitations posed by the conventional collaborative environment such as the difficulty for groups to achieve deep discussions and generate group intelligence, the generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool was introduced. The efficacy of the GAI tool in boosting task performance is still contested and its influence on collaborative knowledge construction remains unclear. Therefore, this study was conducted in an elective course at a university. A total of 30 student teachers were the participants, including 10 groups of 3 students. In the subsequent quasi-experimental study, 5 experimental groups employed the GAI tool and mind mapping based collaborative environment (GMMCE) and 5 control groups employed the conventional mind mapping based collaborative environment (MMCE). The results showed that the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on both collaborative tasks in the course. According to Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), the experimental groups developed a collaborative knowledge construction process in cognitive dimension, i.e., progressive interaction from individual to peer to group. On the contrary, the control groups were mainly reflected in the transition between learners' individual expression and peer interaction since they were more centered on the regulative dimension. We also supplemented students’ perception of using the GAI tool from the interview data. Finally, we highlighted the implications for pedagogy and described the research limitations as well as future directions.},

Industrial dataset are now available with the introduction of Digital Radiography (DR) X-ray machine and are the basis for Automated Defect Recognition (ADR) systems based on Neural Network (NN) object detection models. However, building a big enough dataset is not easy and takes a long time in a production environment, delaying the introduction of ADR models. A potential solution is to use Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to synthesise new images. However, these models fail to generate full realistic images due to the subtle nature of X-ray images. Hence, this paper propose a combination of flawless images and synthetic defects generated by a novel Scalable Conditional Wasserstein GAN (SCWGAN) model. Such synthetic defects are introduced in the target images by a location algorithm that uses a mask image defining the allowable defective areas, the expected Gaussian or Poisson noise level and the defect size and aspect ratio. By creating such synthetic dataset and combine it with the original GDXRay dataset, our proposed detection system achieves an improvement of 17% in mAP@IoU=0.5:0.95 (our target metric to reduced uncertainty on defect location) with regards the baseline model trained with only real images. As a secondary metric, to allow comparison with other studies, the model also achieves 96.0% mAP@IoU=0.50, which exceeds the maximum accuracy available on current literature for the evaluated dataset.},

Renowned for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, generative AI has shown promise in psychological counseling, emotional support, and clinical interventions. However, its application alongside neuroscience and physiology in psychiatry remains underexplored. We propose that generative AI can facilitate translations and adaptive explanations, streamline experimental preparation, enhance multi-modal data analysis, and improve clinical applications through real-time communication, content generation, and data synthesis. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI, as a specialized application of deep learning, can identify new biomarkers and construct neurophysiological models of psychiatric symptoms. We also discuss the synergistic relationship between neuroscience and AI development, particularly in improving AI's emotional recognition and learning mechanisms. While acknowledging the potential benefits, we address the challenges and risks associated with generative AI in psychiatry, including data reliability, privacy concerns, and resource constraints. This perspective advocates for a balanced approach to leveraging AI's capabilities while safeguarding mental health.},

Using a snowball sampling method, this study examined the preparedness, practices, and barriers encountered by 89 U.S. teachers in the state of Idaho. Participants were predominantly White, female teachers serving in rural schools. A mixed-methods analysis of survey responses revealed that teachers were generally underprepared for integrating GenAI, with fewer than half incorporating it into their educational practices. Unlike the widespread classroom integration patterns observed with general educational technologies, teachers in this study tended to use GenAI for out-of-classroom duties (i.e., lesson preparation, assessment, and administrative tasks) rather than for real-time teaching and learning. These preferences could be attributed to key barriers teachers faced, including doubts about GenAI's ability to manage risks (i.e., technology value beliefs), reduced human interaction in instruction (i.e., pedagogical beliefs), ethical considerations, and the absence of policies and guidance. This study highlights the need to develop support systems and targeted policies to facilitate teachers' GenAI integration, offering implications for Idaho's education system and the broader U.S. context.},

The study identifies 34 key GAI-driven green logistics applications, 23 drivers and enablers, and 38 major barriers and challenges. The findings illustrate that GAI-driven green logistics applications, such as risk assessment and mitigation, decision support and real-time environmental response, resilience testing and scenario planning, are essential for developing sustainable logistics ecosystems. Organizational readiness, stakeholder collaboration, and supportive regulatory frameworks emerge as crucial enablers, while lack of digital infrastructure, investment costs, and regulatory gaps constitute significant barriers. The study proposes a decision-making framework to prioritize policy initiatives that could promote GAI adoption in green logistics. This research fills current knowledge gaps and has significant implications for supply chain stakeholders, scholars, and policymakers aiming to support sustainable and cutting-edge logistics systems.},

    abstract = {While generative artificial intelligence has been used to design materials and structures for additive manufacturing, current techniques can only generate design parameters. However, not only design parameters but also additive manufacturing (AM) process parameters affect the mechanical properties of additively manufactured materials. To address this issue, we introduce an auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN)-based computational framework that generates both design and AM process parameters to fabricate lattice structures with target mechanical performance. The computational framework consists of two ACGAN models, including a generative model called InverseACGAN and a forward predictive model called ForwardACGAN. The generative model generates critical design parameters of the lattice structures, including line distance, layer height, and infill pattern, as well as AM process parameters, including print speed and print temperature, based on target mechanical properties (i.e., porosity and compressive modulus). The forward predictive model predicts the mechanical properties of the lattice structures generated by the generative model. The experimental results show that the porosity and compressive modulus of the lattice structures designed by ACGAN are in good agreement with the target porosity and compressive modulus. The average mean absolute percentage errors between target and actual porosity, and target and actual compressive modulus are 6.481% and 10.208%, respectively.},

LAMB addresses critical gaps in existing educational AI solutions by providing a framework specifically designed for the unique requirements of the education sector. It introduces novel features, including a modular architecture for seamless integration of AI assistants into existing LMS platforms and an intuitive interface for educators to create custom AI assistants without coding skills. Unlike existing AI tools in education, LAMB provides a comprehensive framework that addresses privacy concerns, ensures alignment with institutional policies, and promotes using authoritative sources. LAMB leverages the capabilities of large language models and associated generative artificial intelligence technologies to create generative intelligent learning assistants that enhance educational experiences by providing personalized learning support based on clear directions and authoritative fonts of information. Key features of LAMB include its modular architecture, which supports prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and the creation of extensive knowledge bases from diverse educational content, including video sources. The development and deployment of LAMB were iteratively refined using a minimum viable product approach, exemplified by the learning assistant: “Macroeconomics Study Coach,” which effectively integrated lecture transcriptions and other course materials to support student inquiries. Initial validations in various educational settings demonstrate the potential that learning assistants created with LAMB have to enhance teaching methodologies, increase student engagement, and provide personalized learning experiences. The system's usability, scalability, security, and interoperability with existing LMS platforms make it a robust solution for integrating artificial intelligence into educational environments. LAMB's open-source nature encourages collaboration and innovation among educators, researchers, and developers, fostering a community dedicated to advancing the role of artificial intelligence in education.

    abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have shaken the field of language assessment in unprecedented ways. On one hand, large-scale testing companies and organizations have spearheaded AI-based assessment models, infusing GenAI elements into various test development and quality management procedures. On the other hand, in local institutional contexts, although the interest in incorporating AI-based elements in instructional programs has also been soaring, little discussion has been made regarding the affordances and affordability of AI-based assessment systems in local contexts, and the impact of AI on language assessment across contexts remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic review of 77 articles published on GenAI use in language testing and assessment, to synthesize assessment challenges, opportunities, and solutions involving GenAI. We review issues of GenAI in the domains of reliability, validity, fairness, and practicality in large-scale, local, and classroom-based assessments. Based on the findings from the systematic review, we identify principles and best practices of language assessment in the age of GenAI. Additionally, we provide future directions for assessment research and practice related to GenAI, with a focus on impact and sustainability of GenAI in language assessment across contexts. We caution researchers and practitioners about the danger of following the trend of incorporating GenAI in an unmeasured and unselective manner.},

    abstract = {Objective
Participation in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) provides important resources to surgeons, but the ability to do so is often limited by time and data entry personnel. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) are examples of generative artificial intelligence products that may help bridge this gap. Trained on large volumes of data, the models are used for natural language processing and text generation. We evaluated the ability of LLMs to accurately populate VQI procedural databases using operative reports.
Methods
A single-center, retrospective study was performed using institutional VQI data from 2021 to 2023. The most recent procedures for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and infrainguinal lower extremity bypass (LEB) were analyzed using Versa, a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant institutional version of ChatGPT. We created an automated function to analyze operative reports and generate a shareable VQI file using two models: gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4. Application of the LLMs was accomplished with a cloud-based programming interface. The outputs of this model were compared with VQI data for accuracy. We defined a metric as “unavailable” to the LLM if it was discussed by surgeons in <20% of operative reports.
Results
A total of 150 operative notes were analyzed, including 50 CEA, 50 EVAR, and 50 LEB. These procedural VQI databases included 25, 179, and 51 metrics, respectively. For all fields, gpt-35-turbo had a median accuracy of 84.0% for CEA (interquartile range [IQR]: 80.0%-88.0%), 92.2% for EVAR (IQR: 87.2%-94.0%), and 84.3% for LEB (IQR: 80.2%-88.1%). A total of 3 of 25, 6 of 179, and 7 of 51 VQI variables were unavailable in the operative reports, respectively. Excluding metric information routinely unavailable in operative reports, the median accuracy rate was 95.5% for each CEA procedure (IQR: 90.9%-100.0%), 94.8% for EVAR (IQR: 92.2%-98.5%), and 93.2% for LEB (IQR: 90.2%-96.4%). Across procedures, gpt-4 did not meaningfully improve performance compared with gpt-35 (P = .97, .85, and .95 for CEA, EVAR, and LEB overall performance, respectively). The cost for 150 operative reports analyzed with gpt-35-turbo and gpt-4 was $0.12 and $3.39, respectively.
Conclusions
LLMs can accurately populate VQI procedural databases with both structured and unstructured data, while incurring only minor processing costs. Increased workflow efficiency may improve center ability to successfully participate in the VQI. Further work examining other VQI databases and methods to increase accuracy is needed.},

    abstract = {Purpose
To review and evaluate the current literature on the application and impact of large language models (LLMs) in the field of ophthalmology, focusing on studies published in high-ranking ophthalmology journals.
Design
This is a retrospective review of published articles.
Participants
This study did not involve human participation.
Methods
Articles published in the first quartile (Q1) of ophthalmology journals on Scimago Journal & Country Rank discussing different LLMs up to June 7, 2024, were reviewed, parsed, and analyzed.
Main Outcome Measures
All available articles were parsed and analyzed, which included the article and author characteristics and data regarding the LLM used and its applications, focusing on its use in medical education, clinical assistance, research, and patient education.
Results
There were 35 Q1-ranked journals identified, 19 of which contained articles discussing LLMs, with 101 articles eligible for review. One-third were original investigations (32%; 32/101), with an average of 5.3 authors per article. The United States (50.4%; 51/101) was the most represented country, followed by the United Kingdom (25.7%; 26/101) and Canada (16.8%; 17/101). ChatGPT was the most used LLM among the studies, with different versions discussed and compared. Large language model applications were discussed relevant to their implications in medical education, clinical assistance, research, and patient education.
Conclusions
The numerous publications on the use of LLM in ophthalmology can provide valuable insights for stakeholders and consumers of these applications. Large language models present significant opportunities for advancement in ophthalmology, particularly in team science, education, clinical assistance, and research. Although LLMs show promise, they also show challenges such as performance inconsistencies, bias, and ethical concerns. The study emphasizes the need for ongoing artificial intelligence improvement, ethical guidelines, and multidisciplinary collaboration.

@article{DEMIREL2025101127,
    abstract = {ABSTRACT
Background
Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging enables imaging of scar/fibrosis and is a cornerstone of most CMR imaging protocols. CMR imaging can benefit from image acceleration; however, image acceleration in LGE remains challenging due to its limited signal-to-noise ratio. In this study, we sought to evaluate a rapid two-dimensional (2D) LGE imaging protocol using a generative artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm with inline reconstruction.
Methods
A generative AI-based image enhancement was used to improve the sharpness of 2D LGE images acquired with low spatial resolution in the phase-encode direction. The generative AI model is an image enhancement technique built on the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network. The model was trained using balanced steady-state free-precession cine images, readily used for LGE without additional training. The model was implemented inline, allowing the reconstruction of images on the scanner console. We prospectively enrolled 100 patients (55 ± 14 years, 72 males) referred for clinical CMR at 3T. We collected three sets of LGE images in each subject, with in-plane spatial resolutions of 1.5 × 1.5-3-6 mm2. The generative AI model enhanced in-plane resolution to 1.5 × 1.5 mm2 from the low-resolution counterparts. Images were compared using a blur metric, quantifying the perceived image sharpness (0 = sharpest, 1 = blurriest). LGE image sharpness (using a 5-point scale) was assessed by three independent readers.
Results
The scan times for the three imaging sets were 15 ± 3, 9 ± 2, and 6 ± 1 s, with inline generative AI-based images reconstructed time of ∼37 ms. The generative AI-based model improved visual image sharpness, resulting in lower blur metric compared to low-resolution counterparts (AI-enhanced from 1.5 × 3 mm2 resolution: 0.3 ± 0.03 vs 0.35 ± 0.03, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, AI-enhanced images from 1.5 × 3 mm2 resolution and original LGE images showed similar blur metric (0.30 ± 0.03 vs 0.31 ± 0.03, P = 1.0) Additionally, there was an overall 18% improvement in image sharpness between AI-enhanced images from 1.5 × 3 mm2 resolution and original LGE images in the subjective blurriness score (P < 0.01).
Conclusion
The generative AI-based model enhances the image quality of 2D LGE images while reducing the scan time and preserving imaging sharpness. Further evaluation in a large cohort is needed to assess the clinical utility of AI-enhanced LGE images for scar evaluation, as this proof-of-concept study does not provide evidence of an impact on diagnosis.},

    abstract = {Recent advancements in sensor technology and generative artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming precision livestock farming by enhancing behaviour monitoring and predictive analytics. This study examines the effectiveness of Transformer-type generative AI models in predicting cattle behaviour profiles and imputing missing data from collar accelerometer readings collected during two trials in Queensland, Australia, in 2022 and 2023, alongside climatic data. Each trial involved 60 cattle equipped with collars that classified six core behaviours: grazing, ruminating, walking, resting, drinking, and other over five-second time windows. Hourly behaviour profiles were constructed for each animal and experiment day by aggregating the behaviour predictions over every calendar hour, representing the time spent on each behaviour within each hour. Subsequently, four Transformer-type models (i.e., standard Transformer, Informer, Reformer, and Autoformer) were trained on the hourly behaviour profile data to predict behaviour profiles of the next 24 hours for each animal. Among the considered models, Autoformer showed the highest predictive accuracy when including climate data, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of <5.5 min, while the next best model had an MAE of approximately 6 min. For imputing missing data, the standard Transformer outperformed traditional imputation methods, with an MAE of <30 min over 24 hours, compared to 40 to 70 min for traditional methods (mean, median, and linear interpolation). These results highlight the potential of generative AI, particularly Autoformer and Transformer, to enhance predictive accuracy and data imputation in livestock management, thereby supporting regulatory guidance for data-driven decision-making and improved farming practices.},

This research examines the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for market research, enabling marketers to create insights that capture the complexities of market behaviour and customer psychology, helping them to connect with their target audiences more meaningfully and effectively. Particularly, it aims to evaluate the extent to which GAI can replicate traditional market research. We conducted a comprehensive survey on beer consumption in Spain, covering all conversion funnel stages, from Brand Awareness to Purchase. The study was replicated using four prominent LLMs: ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic) and LlaMa (Meta), and the results of these LLMs were compared with those of the traditional survey using a collection of statistical methods. Our results show that LLMs are valuable for market research, offering significant insights as reliable proxies. This represents a competitive advantage by making studies of this kind more accessible and cost-effective, benefitting companies of all sizes. However, LLMs cannot fully replicate traditional methods and present result variability, introducing risks in decision-making because of potential errors in data generation that are complex to estimate without benchmarking.},

OCRs are easily accessible in large numbers on the Internet – for example, through app stores, electronic marketplaces, online shops, and review websites. This paper presents new transfer models to predict technology acceptance and its determinants from OCRs. We train, test, and validate these prediction models using large OCR samples and corresponding observed construct ratings by human experts and generative artificial intelligence chatbots as well as estimated ratings from a traditional customer survey. From a management perspective, the new approach enhances former technology acceptance measurement since we use OCRs as a basis for prediction and discuss the evolution of acceptance over time.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) have revolutionized various fields, notably medical imaging. In the context of Parathyroid Glands detection in Nuclear Medicine, physicians rely on a subtraction process involving two different images. Consequently, the subtracted image depends entirely on the two images. This methodology is manual, time-consuming, and depends entirely on medical expertise. Conditional GAI, a sub-field of GAI, generates new data based on input specifications, enabling more controlled results. However, generative models require a large amount of data and still present limitations in precisely controlling outputs over inputs. This paper presents a new model named Nuclear Medicine U-Net Siamese Network (NM-USNet) based on a combination of U-Net and Siamese networks. The U-Net takes two input images and generates one, while the Siamese network distinguishes between the generated and the reference images. The proposed methodology achieves a mean correlation of 0.956 compared to reference images, showing its potential as a reliable medical tool to assist physicians in the detection of parathyroid glands. This advancement not only improves the accuracy of diagnosis, but also represents a significant step forward in integrating GAI into medical practice. The proposed approach gives high results despite the limited data size.},

    abstract = {Purpose
To generate dye-free ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) images from noninvasive ultra-widefield color fundus photography (UWF-CFP) using generative artificial intelligence (AI) and to evaluate its effectiveness in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening.
Design
A cross-sectional study involving generative AI.
Participants
This study included 1263 patients with DR (2747 UWF-CFP images and 18 321 UWF-FA images) from the Second People's Hospital of Foshan.
Methods
Ultra-widefield CFP and UWF-FA image pairs were matched and used to train a pix2pixHD generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model modified with Gradient Variance Loss. The generated UWF-FA images were evaluated using quantitative similarity metrics and qualitative ophthalmologist evaluation. An external data set, DeepDRiD, was used to validate the contribution of the generated UWF-FA images to DR grading.
Main Outcome Measures
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for DR grading.
Results
The generated early-, mid-, and late-phase UWF-FA images demonstrated high authenticity, with multiscale similarity scores ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 and qualitative evaluation scores from 1.64 to 1.98 (1 = real UWF-FA quality). In a Turing test with 50 randomly selected images, 56% to 76% of the generated images were indistinguishable from real images. Generated UWF-FA images successfully depict details of DR lesions, such as a nonperfusion area and leakage. The incorporation of these generated UWF-FA images in DR grading significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.869 to 0.904 compared with the baseline model using UWF-CFP images alone (P < 0.001).
Conclusions
The study suggests that the GAN-based model can successfully generate realistic multiframe UWF-FA images, which could enhance DR grading without the need for IV dye injection, with the potential to improve the safety and accessibility of DR screening.

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) offers opportunities to enhance learning in nursing education yet raises concerns about academic integrity and critical thinking. Limited research exists on nursing students' ethical understanding and prior GAI exposure.
Aim
To explore freshman nursing students’ understanding of ethical versus unethical uses of GAI, their foundational AI literacy, and prior exposure to AI training.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using a researcher-developed survey administered to 119 freshman BSN students at a large Midwestern university. The survey assessed knowledge of GAI ethics, GAI use, and perceptions of university-led GAI training.
Results
Students demonstrated a strong ability to differentiate between ethical and unethical uses of GAI (93 % accuracy). However, gaps were noted in understanding when AI-generated content crosses into academic dishonesty. Many students reported limited AI training and expressed strong interest in AI learning modules.
Conclusions
Freshman nursing students are eager to use GAI responsibly but lack foundational training. AI literacy education is essential to support ethical decision-making, preserve academic integrity, and prepare students for responsible AI use in nursing practice.},

In the e-commerce domain, GAI has shown tremendous potential in generating online reviews. However, existing literature has paid less attention to how consumers respond to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews. Moreover, little research has explored whether and why consumers are willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. By conducting two experiments, this study investigates how consumers respond differently to GAI-generated reviews versus human-generated reviews and identifies potential factors that influence consumers’ willingness to use GAI to generate reviews. Findings indicate that although there is no significant difference in consumers’ perceptions between human-generated and GAI-generated reviews in terms of review credibility, review richness, and review usefulness, only half of the participants are willing to use GAI to generate reviews. Further analysis results suggest that individuals who consider GAI unethical tend to avoid using GAI. Those with high personal innovativeness are more willing to use GAI to generate online reviews. Our findings deepen the understanding of consumer attitudes toward GAI-generated reviews and provide implications for the deployment of GAI in the online review system.},

Based on a test, with students from different informatics and Information system disciplines in the CoDeAI summer school, 2024, this article concludes that the TBL Co-creation canvas is a useful tool in this matter, thus giving a proof of concept to this method. It functioned well in a social setting such as this summer school. Inter-disciplinary as in this summer school is comparable to what the context will be like in industry innovation work.

    abstract = {To identify the areas of systemic toxicity with the greatest need, and which present the best opportunities for human-relevant model (i.e., new approach methodologies [NAMs]) development, standardization, and implementation, we conducted a landscape analysis to collect information on ongoing efforts in the NAMs space. This type of analysis traditionally requires the collection, manual review, summary, and synthesis of an extensive literature base that requires hundreds of hours to complete. To increase both speed and efficiency, we utilized a reproducible workflow that incorporates multiple computational tools including generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to quickly summarize a large literature database. Our integrated approach coupled subject matter expertise with sorting and extraction algorithms to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the science for NAMs used for, or potentially useful for, the assessment of systemic toxicity of cosmetics. To identify potentially relevant studies, we conducted a literature search with keywords related to NAMs across three major topic areas: in silico, in chemico, and in vitro. We prioritized studies by coupling supervised clustering, topic extraction and keyword analysis algorithms. These methods led to the prioritization of 8,418 studies. To identify relevant studies, subject matter experts were employed in conjunction with active machine learning to identify relevant studies that were then summarized via GenAI. Given the objective was to provide sufficient coverage of the landscape to both address pragmatic, near-term needs, as well as shaping the future of how safety assessments are performed, we designed prompts to characterize the current and past systematic efforts directed towards developing and refining NAMs, including both success stories, scientific and technical challenges, and roadblocks to wider adoption. Our analysis identified 3,010 peer-reviewed publications and 38 consortium websites cataloguing NAMs that were applicable to the cosmetics regulatory process, from hazard-focused endpoints to exposure-based waiving of studies altogether. Additionally, they covered the full spectrum of maturity, from those approaches that show promise at the research and development phase to fully validated approaches ready for immediate regulatory use. To the extent available, we identified the molecular/cellular endpoints associated with each NAM and the reference dataset that was used to develop and/or evaluate usefulness and limitations across a total of 60,960 endpoints. The landscape also captured opportunities to validate mature NAMs to support their regulatory use and market adoption. These results will support the development and identification of NAMs to be included in frameworks for assessing systemic toxicity potential.},

However, evidence of their effectiveness is limited. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, offers a promising avenue for more personalised and effective cessation support. This article reviews existing literature on traditional chatbot interventions for cessation services, explores the potential of AI chatbots, namely ChatGPT, in continuing to support tobacco and vaping cessation efforts, and identifies areas for future research.

It is thus no surprise that researchers have examined whether intensive use of ChatGPT can be considered an addictive behavior. At least four scales measuring ChatGPT addiction have been developed so far, all framed after substance use disorder criteria. Drawing parallels with previous cases of pathologizing everyday behaviors, we caution against labeling and defining intensive or habitual chatbot use as addictive behavior. To label a behavior as addictive, there must be convincing evidence of negative consequences, impaired control, psychological distress, and functional impairment. However, the existing research on problematic use of ChatGPT or other conversational AI bots fails to provide such robust scientific evidence. Caution is thus warranted to avoid (over)pathologization, inappropriate or unnecessary treatments, and excessive regulation of tools that have many benefits when used in a mindful and regulated manner.},

Through tone, assurance, and even the rapidity of responses, GenAI-generated text—either co-written with clinicians or peers, or fully automated—could influence patient perceptions in ways that mental health clinicians may not currently fully anticipate. When embedded in clinician notes or patient-facing summaries, AI language may strengthen expectancies that underlie placebo effects, or conversely, heighten nocebo effects through subtle cues, inaccuracies, or potentially via loss of human nuance. This article explores the implications of AI-mediated clinical communication particularly in mental health care, emphasizing the importance of transparency, ethical oversight, and psychosocial awareness as these technologies evolve.},

    abstract = {Mass individualization is calling for a more sustainable manufacturing paradigm which can address the paradoxes of diversity, complexity, and affordability. Social Manufacturing (SM) represents a democratized servitization trend trying to reshape the traditional production relationship between consumers and manufacturers. To achieve the SM visions, new operational mechanisms for SM should be constructed to overcome the challenges of information sharing, accuracy, efficiency, security, sovereignty, etc. The survey found that task assignment (TA) is one of the foundational mechanisms for the implementation of regular autonomous manufacturing systems, as well as the role of TA is further amplified for distributed collaborative environments. Therefore, inspired by the relevant research of management science, Platform-based Task Assignment (PBTA) is proposed to distinguish and conceptualize this different research topic. In SM platforms, the diverse capacities and resources can be shared, so that knowing "who can do” and “select whom to do" is more important than knowing "how to do". Furthermore, the studies on TA for SM present a difference from the previous studies on TA in manufacturing. From a perspective of supply-demand mapping, PBTA illustrates the foundational operational mechanism for SM attracting many researchers’ attention from different fields. Meanwhile, research on PBTA is also required for the platform practices in the era of digital, shared, and platform economy. Given the academic importance and practical value, this survey carefully selects 250 valuable research articles relevant to PBTA for SM. A novel workflow model and knowledge framework, namely PBTA4SM, is proposed to identify and organize the critical issues and challenges. This study shows the state-of-the-art research advancement of PBTA including task design considerations, modelling methods, typical engineering problems, algorithms, decision patterns, key activities, and governance mechanisms. Finally, we complete this holistic survey by highlighting eight potential directions for future research in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) era.},

@article{BRITOZERON2025570,
    abstract = {Background:
Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous granulomatous disease characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations stemming from multiple organ involvement. While clustering techniques offer a robust method for uncovering these patterns, traditional approaches may fail to fully capture the complexity of multisystem diseases like sarcoidosis. Leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a unique opportunity to improve data analysis and interpretation in complex systemic settings, providing novel insights into multifaceted disease patterns and guiding both hypothesis generation and clinical decision-making.
Objectives:
This study aimed to identify distinct clusters of organ involvement in patients with sarcoidosis, assess their corresponding epidemiological characteristics, and highlight the benefits of AI-driven methodologies in handling complex multisystem data—underscoring the feasibility and advantages of advanced AI-based approaches for systemic phenotypes in this heterogeneous disease.
Methods:
We conducted an AI-assisted analysis to identify organ-involvement clusters in a dataset of 2,187 anonymized sarcoidosis patients (Spanish National Registry SarcoGEAS, all fulfilling the 1999 ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria). Organ involvement was retrospectively determined in each patient at the time of diagnosis using the 2014 WASOG organ assessment instrument. Clustering was carried out via the k-means algorithm in Python's scikit-learn library (version 1.0.2). The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, supported by silhouette scores to evaluate cluster quality. Statistical comparisons (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and Chi-square tests—using exact tests for low-frequency data) were applied to characterize cluster differences. Significance was set at p < 0.05, ensuring rigorous evaluation of epidemiological and clinical distinctions. The analysis was conducted in a secure computational environment using generative AI (via OpenAI's GPT-4 model) using Python (version 3.9) with essential libraries including pandas (1.4.3) for data manipulation, numpy (1.21.5) for numerical computations, and matplotlib (3.5.1) and seaborn (0.11.2) for visualizations. Data processing and analysis workflows adhered to GDPR standards to ensure patient privacy. All patient data were anonymized prior to analysis, and no identifiable information was accessed at any point. Code modularity and reproducibility were prioritized, with all scripts managed in version control systems (e.g., Git) to enable transparency.
Results:
The cohort comprised 2,187 patients, with a female predominance (61.4%), a mean age at diagnosis of 48.6 years (range: 5-95), and a majority identifying as White (88%). Cluster quality analysis identified 5 as the optimal number of clusters potential; an additional clinically significant cluster (hepatic-splenic) was manually identified and confirmed post hoc through statistical validation. Ultimately, we defined six distinct clusters of systemic involvement: the lymphadenopathic cluster (Cluster 1, characterized by 100% lymphadenopathy), the pulmonary cluster (Cluster 2, characterized by 100% lung involvement and co-occurring 100% lymphadenopathy), the cutaneous cluster (Cluster 3, 100% of cutaneous involvement), the ocular cluster (Cluster 4, 100% ocular involvement), the hepato-splenic cluster (Cluster 5, defined by 100% hepatic and splenic involvement), and the multisystemic cluster (Cluster 6, exhibiting generalized, but not predominant, organ involvement). Each cluster demonstrated statistically significant epidemiological differences (Figure 1). For age, the lymphadenopathic cluster had the highest mean (51.7 years), whereas the cutaneous cluster had the lowest (42.9 years) (p = 0.00056). For sex, the proportion of females ranged from 49.0% in the hepato-splenic cluster to 65.9% in the ocular cluster (p = 0.000017). For ethnicity, the proportion of White patients ranged from 81.4% in the ocular cluster to 94.6% in the lymphadenopathic cluster (p = 0.00135).
Conclusion:
This generative AI-driven clustering study successfully identified six distinct patterns of systemic involvement in sarcoidosis, offering a deeper understanding of the disease's heterogeneity. Each cluster exhibited specific epidemiological profiles: cutaneous cluster was associated with the youngest age at sarcoidosis diagnosis, lymphadenopathic cluster with the oldest age and the highest frequency of White patients, ocular cluster with the highest frequency of women and highest frequency of non-White patients, and the hepato-splenic cluster with the highest rate of men. The significant epidemiological disparities among clusters underscore the disease's variability and offer a framework for refined patient stratification.

    abstract = {The quest for Artificial Intelligence (AI) has comprised successive waves of excessive enthusiasm followed by long, dispirited lulls. Most recently, during the first 3–4 years of public access to Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), many authors have bought into the bullish atmosphere, replaying consultancies' predictions about gold mines of process efficiency and innovation. A more balanced approach to the technology is needed. Instances of apparently positive results need calm analysis, firstly to distinguish mirages from genuine contributions; secondly, to identify ways to effectively exploit the new capabilities; and thirdly, to formulate guidance for the avoidance and mitigation of negative consequences. This article's first contribution is to ground the evaluation of GenAI's pathway, applications, impacts, implications and risks in a sufficiently deep appreciation of the technology's nature and key features. A wide range of sources is drawn on, in order to present descriptions of the processes involved in text-based GenAI. From those processes, 20 key characteristics are abstracted that together give rise to the promise and the threats GenAI embodies. The effects of GenAI derive not from the technological features alone, but also from the patterns within which it is put to use. By mapping usage patterns across to domains of application, the phenomenon's impacts and implications can be more reliably delineated. The analysis provides a platform whereby the article's final contribution can be made. Previously-formulated principles for the responsible application of AI of all kinds are applied in the particular context of GenAI.},

@article{BRAGAZZI2025,
    abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly strained health care systems globally, leading to an overwhelming influx of patients and exacerbating resource limitations. Concurrently, an “infodemic” of misinformation, particularly prevalent in women’s health, has emerged. This challenge has been pivotal for health care providers, especially gynecologists and obstetricians, in managing pregnant women’s health. The pandemic heightened risks for pregnant women from COVID-19, necessitating balanced advice from specialists on vaccine safety versus known risks. In addition, the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), offers promising support in health care. However, they necessitate rigorous testing.
Objective
This study aimed to assess LLMs’ proficiency, clarity, and objectivity regarding COVID-19’s impacts on pregnancy.
Methods
This study evaluates 4 major AI prototypes (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Bard) using zero-shot prompts in a questionnaire validated among 159 Israeli gynecologists and obstetricians. The questionnaire assesses proficiency in providing accurate information on COVID-19 in relation to pregnancy. Text-mining, sentiment analysis, and readability (Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Flesch Reading Ease Score) were also conducted.
Results
In terms of LLMs’ knowledge, ChatGPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot each scored 97% (32/33), Google Bard 94% (31/33), and ChatGPT-3.5 82% (27/33). ChatGPT-4 incorrectly stated an increased risk of miscarriage due to COVID-19. Google Bard and Microsoft Copilot had minor inaccuracies concerning COVID-19 transmission and complications. In the sentiment analysis, Microsoft Copilot achieved the least negative score (–4), followed by ChatGPT-4 (–6) and Google Bard (–7), while ChatGPT-3.5 obtained the most negative score (–12). Finally, concerning the readability analysis, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch Reading Ease Score showed that Microsoft Copilot was the most accessible at 9.9 and 49, followed by ChatGPT-4 at 12.4 and 37.1, while ChatGPT-3.5 (12.9 and 35.6) and Google Bard (12.9 and 35.8) generated particularly complex responses.
Conclusions
The study highlights varying knowledge levels of LLMs in relation to COVID-19 and pregnancy. ChatGPT-3.5 showed the least knowledge and alignment with scientific evidence. Readability and complexity analyses suggest that each AI’s approach was tailored to specific audiences, with ChatGPT versions being more suitable for specialized readers and Microsoft Copilot for the general public. Sentiment analysis revealed notable variations in the way LLMs communicated critical information, underscoring the essential role of neutral and objective health care communication in ensuring that pregnant women, particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, receive accurate and reassuring guidance. Overall, ChatGPT-4, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Bard generally provided accurate, updated information on COVID-19 and vaccines in maternal and fetal health, aligning with health guidelines. The study demonstrated the potential role of AI in supplementing health care knowledge, with a need for continuous updating and verification of AI knowledge bases. The choice of AI tool should consider the target audience and required information detail level.},

    abstract = {Background
As a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, radiology reports are immediately released to patients. However, these reports are often too complex for the lay patient, potentially leading to stress and anxiety. While solutions such as patient portals or providing radiologist contact information have been proposed in the past, new generative artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT and Google Gemini may provide the most accessible and scalable method of simplifying radiology reports for patients. Here, we gather the opinions of radiologists regarding this possibility.
Methods
An eight-question survey was sent out to all diagnostic/interventional radiology attendings and clinical fellows at our large academic medical center.
Results
From our survey (N = 52), 52.8 % of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that patients should have immediate access to their radiology reports. Only 9.61 % agreed that radiology reports are understandable by the lay patient. Regarding potential avenues to improve patient comprehension of their radiology reports, using artificial intelligence to simplify reports with a manual check by radiologists garnered the most support/strong support (46.2 %). Support of artificial intelligence generated simplifications dropped to (23.1 %) without a manual check.
Conclusion
Patients are increasingly gaining access to their radiology reports, but reports may be too complex for the lay patient. Eventually, artificial intelligence systems may help simplify radiology reports for patients, but there is currently limited support from radiologists.},

    abstract = {Background
General awareness and exposure to generative artificial intelligence (AI) have increased recently. This transformative technology has the potential to create a more dynamic and engaging user experience in digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). However, if not appropriately used and controlled, it can introduce risks to users that may result in harm and erode trust. At the time of conducting this trial, there had not been a rigorous evaluation of an approach to safely implementing generative AI in a DMHI.
Objective
This study aims to explore the user relationship, experience, safety, and technical guardrails of a DMHI using generative AI compared with a rules-based intervention.
Methods
We conducted a 2-week exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 160 adult participants randomized to receive a generative AI (n=81) or rules-based (n=79) version of a conversation-based DMHI. Self-report measures of the user relationship (client satisfaction, working alliance bond, and accuracy of empathic listening and reflection) and experience (engagement metrics, adverse events, and technical guardrail success) were collected. Descriptions and validation of technical guardrails for handling user inputs (eg, detecting potentially concerning language and off-topic responses) and model outputs (eg, not providing medical advice and not providing a diagnosis) are provided, along with examples to illustrate how they worked. Safety monitoring was conducted throughout the trial for adverse events, and the success of technical guardrails created for the generative arm was assessed post trial.
Results
In general, the majority of measures of user relationship and experience appeared to be similar in both the generative and rules-based arms. The generative arm appeared to be more accurate at detecting and responding to user statements with empathy (98% accuracy vs 69%). There were no serious or device-related adverse events, and technical guardrails were shown to be 100% successful in posttrial review of generated statements. A majority of participants in both groups reported an increase in positive sentiment (62% and 66%) about AI at the end of the trial.
Conclusions
This trial provides initial evidence that, with the right guardrails and process, generative AI can be successfully used in a digital mental health intervention (DMHI) while maintaining the user experience and relationship. It also provides an initial blueprint for approaches to technical and conversational guardrails that can be replicated to build a safe DMHI.

Our study investigated nursing faculty's knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education, examining differences by degree type and the influence of policies or syllabi on AI integration.
Methods
A descriptive, cross-sectional study assessed faculty's self-perceptions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes regarding AI in education. Data were gathered via a survey of nursing faculty from diverse institutions.
Results
Findings revealed gaps in AI knowledge and skills linked to educational level and institutional policy development. Doctorly prepared-faculty reported higher perceived knowledge and skills, while BS-prepared faculty had higher attitudes toward AI. Faculty involved in AI policy or syllabus development perceived greater knowledge, skills, and attitudes.
Conclusion
Faculty education and policy support are critical for integrating AI into education. Institutions should invest in faculty development and ethical AI adoption, using case studies, simulation, and decision-support tools to enhance curriculum and healthcare outcomes.},

    abstract = {The rapid development of AI has fuelled the spread of deepfake pornography synthetic content that realistically fakes an individual's identity without their consent. This phenomenon has complex social, legal, and ethical implications, particularly related to privacy violations, sexual exploitation, and legal vulnerabilities. This study aims to analyze the social impacts of deepfake pornography, identify existing legal gaps, and evaluate the ethical and regulatory responses that have emerged globally. Using the SLR approach, this study adopts the PICOS framework and PRISMA methodology in the screening and selection of scientific publications. The study finds that the majority of victims, especially women and vulnerable groups, experience psychological, social, and professional harm. Barriers to access to justice are exacerbated by weak legal frameworks, limited capacity of law enforcement officers, and gender bias in legal protection. The absence of a specific legal definition widens the scope for exploitation and exacerbates social inequality. The study recommends comprehensive legal reforms, including criminalization of non-consensual deepfake content, obligations for digital platforms in content moderation, and adoption of technologies such as watermarking (visible and invisible), C2PA standards-based metadata labelling, and advanced AI detection to track synthetic media. Regulatory initiatives such as the California AI Transparency Act, the TAKE IT DOWN Act, the EU AI Act, and the UK Online Safety Act 2023 show the direction of international law development. In addition, public education about the dangers of deepfakes and their legal consequences is an important part of prevention efforts. An interdisciplinary approach that integrates technological, legal, and ethical aspects is needed to build an adaptive and fair protection system in the digital era.},

Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, we developed a model to assess the factors influencing decision-makers' intention to adopt GenAI as a substitute for entry-level jobs in financial institutions. To test the hypotheses, we collected survey data from 335 respondents in Malaysian financial institutions and analyzed it using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that trust in GenAI significantly affects decision-makers' intention to adopt it as an alternative solution to human positions. Trust, in turn, was found to be positively influenced by constructs from the Theory of Effective Use (transparent interaction, informed action, and representational fidelity) as well as AI literacy, which reflects users' ability to evaluate and interact with AI. The results also show that personality traits, particularly conscientiousness, moderate the relationship between trust and adoption intention, highlighting the importance of individual differences in GenAI usage. Collectively, our findings extend the S-O-R framework by revealing how both cognitive and affective factors shape GenAI adoption behavior. The study also offers practical implications for GenAI stakeholders, especially about the vital role of trust-building strategies in fostering AI adoption.},

Complex prompting and unreadiness among faculty and students are some of the reported challenges when incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into simulation-based education (SBE) in undergraduate healthcare programmes. However, strategies for incorporating GenAI into SBE are unclear. This scoping review identified current evidence on GenAI technology, its role, study outcomes, and strategies to incorporate GenAI into the SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes.
Methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was adopted. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 21, 2025. Two authors independently screened and extracted data. The PAGER framework collated, critiqued, and reported the results.
Results
Eight studies were included. ChatGPT was the most frequently employed GenAI technology in SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes, to enhance the students’ cognitive and affective learning. Study outcomes focused on usability. Five core strategies were synthesized: (a) establish guidelines on GenAI use; (b) enhance GenAI literacy; (c) enhance competency in GenAI prompting in simulation; (d) ensure pedagogical alignment; and (e) conduct pilot tests.
Conclusions
The findings provide insights into GenAI integration in SBE in undergraduate healthcare programmes. Further studies on the benefits of GenAI when applied to SBE are needed to demonstrate its impact on student learning.},

    abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 Vision, capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education. This paper derives a theoretical framework for integrating MLLMs into multimodal learning. This framework serves to explore the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for MLLMs range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering engagement in scientific practices, and providing assessments and feedback. These applications are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, thus increasing personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness. Despite the many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educators' roles, ensuring an effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs for educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. Through developing a theoretical framework for the integration of MLLMs into multimodal learning and exploring the associated potentials, challenges, and future implications, this paper contributes to a preliminary examination of the transformative role of MLLMs in science education and beyond.},

Our objective was to test the ability of ChatGPT 4.0 to provide accurate information for patients and physicians about abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and to assess its alignment with Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for AAA care.
Material and methods
Fifteen patient-level questions, 37 questions selected to reflect 28 SVS CPGs and 4 questions regarding AAA rupture risk were posed to ChatGPT 4.0. Single responses were recorded and graded for accuracy and quality by ten board-certified vascular surgeons as well as two fellow trainees using a 5-point Likert scale; 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent.
Results
The mean of the means (MoM) accuracy rating across all 15 patient-level questions was 4.4 (SD 0.4, quartile range (QR) 4.2-4.7). ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated good alignment with SVS practice guidelines (MoM: 4.2, SD: 0.4, QR: 3.9-4.5). The accuracy of responses was consistent across guideline categories; screening or surveillance (4.2), indications for surgery (4.5), preoperative risk assessment (4.5), perioperative coronary revascularization (4.1), and perioperative management (4.2). The generative artificial intelligence bot demonstrated only fair performance in answering the annual AAA rupture risk (MoM: 3.4, SD: 1.2, QR: 2.3-4.3).
Conclusions
ChatGPT 4.0 provided accurate responses to a variety of patient-level questions regarding AAA. Responses were well-aligned with current SVS CPGs except for inaccuracies in the risk of AAA rupture at varying diameters. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence bots presents an opportunity for study of applications in patient education and to determine their ability to augment the vascular specialist's knowledge base.},

@article{CLARK2025,
    abstract = {Background
Recent developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have introduced the general public to powerful, easily accessible tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, for a rapidly expanding range of uses. Among those uses are specialized chatbots that serve in the role of a therapist, as well as personally curated digital companions that offer emotional support. However, the ability of AI therapists to provide consistently safe and effective treatment remains largely unproven, and those concerns are especially salient in regard to adolescents seeking mental health support.
Objective
This study aimed to determine the willingness of therapy and companion AI chatbots to endorse harmful or ill-advised ideas proposed by fictional teenagers experiencing mental health distress.
Methods
A convenience sample of 10 publicly available AI bots offering therapeutic support or companionship were each presented with 3 detailed fictional case vignettes of adolescents with mental health challenges. Each fictional adolescent asked the AI chatbot to endorse 2 harmful or ill-advised proposals, such as dropping out of school, avoiding all human contact for a month, or pursuing a relationship with an older teacher, resulting in a total of 6 proposals presented to each chatbot. The clinical scenarios presented were intended to reflect challenges commonly seen in the practice of therapy with adolescents, and the proposals offered by the fictional teenagers were intended to be clearly dangerous or unwise. The 10 AI bots were selected by the author to represent a range of chatbot types, including generic AI bots, companion bots, and dedicated mental health bots. Chatbot responses were analyzed for explicit endorsement, defined as direct support for the teenagers’ proposed behavior.
Results
Across 60 total scenarios, chatbots actively endorsed harmful proposals in 19 out of the 60 (32%) opportunities to do so. Of the 10 chatbots, 4 endorsed half or more of the ideas proposed to them, and none of the bots managed to oppose them all.
Conclusions
A significant proportion of AI chatbots offering mental health or emotional support endorsed harmful proposals from fictional teenagers. These results raise concerns about the ability of some AI-based companion or therapy bots to safely support teenagers with serious mental health issues and heighten concern that AI bots may tend to be overly supportive at the expense of offering useful guidance when appropriate. The results highlight the urgent need for oversight, safety protocols, and ongoing research regarding digital mental health support for adolescents.},

At the same time, it has introduced confusion about what GenAI is capable of, how it should be used, and where it fits within existing business structures. While GenAI is often treated as a singular capability, we argue that it is better understood as a collection of distinct intelligences that vary in maturity and application. Drawing from Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences theory, this paper introduces a taxonomy of GenAI intelligences and maps how they relate to current and emerging use cases. Leveraging this taxonomy, we then offer practical guidance to help businesses identify where GenAI can provide value today and where it remains limited.

    abstract = {Purpose
Our aim is to develop a highly precise corporate crisis prediction model that surpasses previous versions, rooted in the forefront of technological advancements.
Design/methodology/approach
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for corporate default prediction with a novel approach based on a mix of techniques, enabling it to achieve a higher accuracy. We investigated models with sequence lengths that were both fixed and variable, and we chose the best variable sequence length model.
Findings
Our findings demonstrate that the artificial techniques implemented lead to very high accuracy in predicting business crises compared to previous research efforts, even those utilising long-time sequences or a high volume of observations.
Research limitations/implications
We highlight the key variables with a higher predictive power that need monitoring to prevent business crises. We also aim to open a new avenue of research that, starting from the use of these techniques and our results, can implement models incorporating non-accounting variables to prevent business crises.
Practical implications
We provide a model/tool that assesses a possible business crisis in advance through a monitoring and alert system. Policymakers can use our research’s output as a tool to combine with current credit-scoring systems and to assess the effectiveness of the new corporate crisis reforms that are upcoming in many European countries. The results of our research can be useful also to banks, public entities, and consulting firms that interact with companies and are interested in the evaluation of a firm’s financial health and stability.
Originality/value
Our innovative work leverages cutting-edge methodologies such as deep Recurrent Neural Networks and explainable AI. This choice is driven by the rapid evolution of AI techniques in practical application.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT
Generative artificial intelligence (AI), ChatGPT being the most popular example, has been extensively assessed for its capability to respond to medical questions, such as queries in spine treatment approaches or technological advances. However, it often lacks scientific foundation or fabricates inauthentic references, also known as AI hallucinations.
PURPOSE
To develop an understanding of the scientific basis of generative AI tools by studying the authenticity of references and reliability in comparison to the alignment of responses of evidence-based guidelines.
STUDY DESIGN
Comparative study.
METHODS
Thirty-three previously published North American Spine Society (NASS) guideline questions were posed as prompts to 2 freely available generative AI tools (Tools I and II). The responses were scored for correctness compared with the published NASS guideline responses using a 5-point “alignment score." Furthermore, all cited references were evaluated for authenticity, source type, year of publication, and inclusion in the scientific guidelines.
RESULTS
Both tools’ responses to guideline questions achieved an overall score of 3.5±1.1, which is considered acceptable to be equivalent to the guideline. Both tools generated 254 references to support their responses, of which 76.0% (n=193) were authentic and 24.0% (n=61) were fabricated. From these, authentic references were: peer-reviewed scientific research papers (147, 76.2%), guidelines (16, 8.3%), educational websites (9, 4.7%), books (9, 4.7%), a government website (1, 0.5%), insurance websites (6, 3.1%) and newspaper websites (5, 2.6%). Claude referenced significantly more authentic peer-reviewed scientific papers (Claude: n=111, 91.0%; Gemini: n=36, 50.7%; p<.001). The year of publication amongst all references ranged from 1988-2023, with significantly older references provided by Claude (Claude: 2008±6; Gemini: 2014±6; p<.001). Lastly, significantly more references provided by Claude were also referenced in the published NASS guidelines (Claude: n=27, 24.3%; Gemini: n=1, 2.8%; p=.04).
CONCLUSIONS
Both generative AI tools provided responses that had acceptable alignment with NASS evidence-based guideline recommendations and offered references, though nearly a quarter of the references were inauthentic or nonscientific sources. This deficiency of legitimate scientific references does not meet standards for clinical implementation. Considering this limitation, caution should be exercised when applying the output of generative AI tools to clinical applications.},

Higher education institutions have been firmly focused on the impacts of this innovation on academic integrity while grappling with unknown longer-term impacts on students' academic study and future work. This mixed method study aims to capture student perspectives on their self-reported understanding of GenAI and intentions to use GenAI for their academic study during the critical diffusion stage and policy vacuum. Through a survey with 194 university students, the study explored student's understanding, knowledge, experience and intended use of GenAI tools to support their academic study. The paper presents three distinct student profiles established through cluster analysis of measures of digital and AI literacy, which are then explored in-depth through presentation of qualitative items. Notably, the cluster profiles demonstrate variation across the profiles of novice, cautious and enthusiastic users and patterns related to their knowledge of ChatGPT and intended uses. The paper draws on digital divide empirical literature and explores the potential to repeat digital divides among groups of students based on their access, capabilities, and capacity to leverage these for educational advantage. We propose that building upon a vast existing body of educational research about digital literacy inequalities offers rich insights into the current problems facing education institutions, specifically, what role do universities play in supporting students to understand and harness GenAI, now and in their futures.},

Current research reveals robust defensive approaches; however, there remains a significant gap in the application of Generative AI to develop advanced attack scenarios capable of bypassing existing defense mechanisms. Our work attempts to fill this gap and spreads awareness regarding a potential exposure of Neural Network (NN)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) against AI-enhanced attacks. Unlike conventional approaches that focus on Input Perturbation, Data Poisoning, or Spoofing, we propose a novel offensive strategy called Attack Obfuscation. This strategy leverages Conditional GANs (CGANs) to conceal genuine attacks by injecting synthetic traffic designed to deceive NN-based IDS. The experimental investigation validates the proposed approach against three distinct datasets and different typologies of attacks, managing to successfully deceive the IDS.},

The negative effects are more pronounced among analysts whose pre-ban reports are more consistent with AI use or analysts with a technical background. The ban also diminishes forecast accuracy, increases reliance on industry-specific information, and reduces information efficiency. Furthermore, investor reactions to earnings announcements become more pronounced, and bid–ask spreads widen, reflecting lower market efficiency.},

Recognizing the inequalities that circumscribe the use of these technologies, this paper proposes materiality, indexicality, and ideology as key constructs that help develop an understanding of critical digital literacies relevant to GenAI-mediated L2 writing and digital multimodal composing. These constructs draw attention to how platform designs and other material processes, together with learner access to resources, can steer learners toward particular interactions and discourses. By understanding how GenAI platforms trained on large datasets can privilege certain ways of thinking and writing, L2 writers can develop a more critical perspective of how these technologies can shape the way we write ourselves into being.},

    abstract = {As urbanization accelerates, aging infrastructure demands more advanced inspection methods for structural health monitoring. The growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision technologies has significantly enhanced damage detection accuracy while simultaneously reducing inspection time and operational costs. Despite these advantages, the adoption of AI-based technologies in infrastructure maintenance remains limited due to challenges related to data. One major issue is the lack of comprehensive, task-specific annotated datasets. Another is the poor quality of images captured by drones or mobile devices, which are often affected by noise, blurring, and inconsistent lighting. Although recent advances in generative AI offer promising support for structural health monitoring, it remains unclear which models are best suited for specific tasks. This study examines the use of generative AI in structural health monitoring, focusing on key challenges such as limited datasets and low-quality image restoration. The review covers a range of generative AI technologies, outlining their principles, strengths, limitations, and representative applications to support the selection of appropriate tools for specific tasks. Generative AI models enable accurate image segmentation and structural anomaly detection using limited training data. The paper also explores new opportunities for integrating multi-modal generative AI to enhance human–computer interaction in support of structural health monitoring. A framework is proposed to streamline the use of generative AI technologies for data augmentation, image restoration, damage inspection, and human–computer interaction in structural health monitoring.},

    abstract = {The relationship between digital literacy and information literacy has been suggested in many studies. Despite this suggestion, research providing context-related data and research findings for university librarians and educators in Ghana is inadequate. This has left many academic librarians with the difficult task of training students for the digital world on their own, with insufficient resources to provide guidance. The insufficient resources include context-relevant data to guide policy, clear research findings to support actions and evidence to convince university policy makers about the need for course reform and increased access to technology. This paper uses a correlational design in a sample of Ghanaian university students. It investigates the relationship between digital literacy, information literacy, access to and use of technology and intention to use technology. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for pairwise relationships between the variables. The relationship between information literacy and digital literacy was conceptualized as digital information literacy and backed with data from the study. Correlations between digital literacy and information literacy were supported, and a simple linear regression further showed that information literacy predicts digital literacy. A correlation between the intention to use technology and digital literacy, as well as information literacy and intention to use technology, was supported. The findings suggest that academic librarians in Africa improve information literacy training to cover digital topics. University policy makers are advised to improve access to and use of digital technology, be open to the ethical use of digital sources of information and ensure that all students receive training in digital sources of information and new approaches.},

Despite concerns about academic integrity and AI-driven misconduct, its potential to revolutionize how students engage with and master complex subjects is undeniable. This study explores the key factors that influence social science students' adoption of ChatGPT as a transformative tool to enhance their learning of data analytics. Using a descriptive quantitative research design, data were collected from a sample of 413 Omani students. The study utilizes the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as a guiding theoretical framework. Through ordinal logistic regression analysis, the study identifies performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, self-efficacy, and effort expectancy as significant predictors of students' decisions to adopt ChatGPT for their learning needs. Descriptive findings reveal that students highly value ChatGPT's capability to simplify complex data analytics concepts and assist in selecting appropriate analytical methods. This demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing conceptual understanding. However, the tool received lower ratings for tasks such as data pre-processing and cleaning, suggesting some limitations in its effectiveness in these aspects of data analytics learning. The study's findings highlight ChatGPT's substantial potential to enhance academic performance in data analytics and provide practical recommendations for students, instructors and institutions. The focus is on strategically integrating AI technologies to optimize instructional effectiveness and foster deeper student engagement with data analytics curricula.},

    abstract = {Help-seeking is an active learning strategy tied to self-regulated learning (SRL), where learners seek assistance when facing challenges. They may seek help from teachers, peers, intelligent tu-tor systems, and more recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, there is limited empirical research on how learners’ help-seeking process differs between generative AI and hu-man experts. To address this, we conducted a lab experiment with 38 university students tasked with essay writing and revising. The students were randomly divided into two groups: one seeking help from ChatGPT (AI Group) and the other from an experienced teacher (HE Group). To examine their help-seeking processes, we used a combination of statistical testing and process mining methods, analyzing multimodal data (e.g., trace data, eye-tracking data, and conversa-tional data). Our results indicated that the AI Group exhibited a nonlinear help-seeking process, such as skipping evaluation, differing significantly from the linear model observed in the HE Group which also aligned with classic help-seeking theory. Detailed analysis revealed that the AI Group asked more operational questions, showing pragmatic help-seeking activities, whereas the HE Group was more proactive in evaluating and processing received feedback. We discussed factors such as social pressure, metacognitive off-loading, and over-reliance on AI in these different help-seeking scenarios. More importantly, this study offers innovative insights and evidence, based on multimodal data, to better understand and scaffold learners learning with generative AI.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly large language models (LLMs)—has generated unprecedented interest in applications ranging from everyday questions and answers to health-related inquiries. However, little is known about how everyday users decide whether to trust and adopt these technologies in high-stakes contexts such as personal health.
Objectives
This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, and risk perception interact to shape user trust in and intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for health care purposes.
Methods
We adapted survey items from validated technology acceptance scales to assess user perception of DeepSeek. A 12-item Likert scale questionnaire was developed and pilot-tested (n=20). It was then distributed on the web to users in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had used DeepSeek within the past 2 weeks. Data analysis involved descriptive frequency assessments and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The model assessed direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships.
Results
A total of 556 complete responses were collected, with respondents almost evenly split across India (n=184), the United Kingdom (n=185), and the United States (n=187). Regarding AI in health care, when asked whether they were comfortable with their health care provider using AI tools, 59.3% (n=330) were fine with AI use provided their doctor verified its output, and 31.5% (n=175) were enthusiastic about its use without conditions. DeepSeek was used primarily for academic and educational purposes, 50.7% (n=282) used DeepSeek as a search engine, and 47.7% (n=265) used it for health-related queries. When asked about their intent to adopt DeepSeek over other LLMs such as ChatGPT, 52.1% (n=290) were likely to switch, and 28.9% (n=161) were very likely to do so. The study revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role; ease of use exerts a significant indirect impact on usage intentions through trust. At the same time, perceived usefulness contributes to trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Significant nonlinear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects.
Conclusions
Users are receptive to DeepSeek when it is easy to use, useful, and trustworthy. The model highlights trust as a mediator and shows nonlinear dynamics shaping AI-driven health care tool adoption. Expanding the model with mediators such as privacy and cultural differences could provide deeper insights. Longitudinal experimental designs could establish causality. Further investigation into threshold and plateau phenomena could refine our understanding of user perceptions as they become more familiar with AI-driven health care tools.},

    abstract = {Background
Having well-informed patients is crucial to enhancing patient satisfaction, quality of life, and health outcomes, which in turn optimizes health care use. Traditional methods of delivering information, such as booklets and leaflets, are often ineffective and can overwhelm patients. Educational videos represent a promising alternative; however, their production typically requires significant time and financial resources. Video production using generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology may provide a solution to this problem.
Objective
This study aimed to use natural language processing (NLP) to understand free-text patient feedback on 1 of 7 AI-generated patient educational videos created in collaboration with Roche UK and the Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust breast cancer team, titled “Breast Cancer Follow Up Programme.”
Methods
A survey was sent to 400 patients who had completed the breast cancer treatment pathway, and 98 (24.5%) free-text responses were received for the question “Any comments or suggestions to improve its [the video’s] contents?” We applied and evaluated different NLP machine learning techniques to draw insights from these unstructured data, namely sentiment analysis, topic modeling, summarization, and term frequency–inverse document frequency word clouds.
Results
Sentiment analysis showed that 81% (79/98) of the responses were positive or neutral, while negative comments were predominantly related to the AI avatar. Topic modeling using BERTopic with k-means clustering was found to be the most effective model and identified 4 key topics: the breast cancer treatment pathway, video content, the digital avatar or narrator, and short responses with little or no content. The term frequency–inverse document frequency word clouds indicated positive sentiment about the treatment pathway (eg, “reassured” and “faultless”) and video content (eg, “informative” and “clear”), whereas the AI avatar was often described negatively (eg, “impersonal”). Summarization using the text-to-text transfer transformer model effectively created summaries of the responses by topic.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the success of NLP techniques in efficiently generating insights into patient feedback related to generative AI educational content. Combining NLP methods resulted in clear visuals and insights, enhancing the understanding of patient feedback. Analysis of free-text responses provided clinicians at Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust with deeper insights than those obtained from quantitative Likert scale responses alone. Importantly, the results validate the use of generative AI in creating patient educational videos, highlighting its potential to address the challenges of costly video production and the limitations of traditional, often overwhelming educational leaflets. Despite the positive overall feedback, negative comments focused on the technical aspects of the AI avatar, indicating areas for improvement. We advocate that patients who receive AI avatar explanations are counseled that this technology is intended to supplement, not replace, human health care interactions. Future investigations are needed to confirm the ongoing effectiveness of these educational tools.},

    abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence has improved, there is a growing trend of generating false media for spreading misinformation, driving propaganda, and theft through enhanced social engineering. This creates a global concern, leading to a heavy demand for verification and fact-checking of information. Existing solutions aim at educating users or using artificial intelligence to fact-check and detect false documents or media. While these methods provide a measure for combating misinformation, many of these existing methods are inaccurate. Methods such as deepfake detection for videos are an uphill battle as deepfake generation keeps improving and newer methods are created to subvert deepfake detection techniques. VeracOS is introduced and presented as an operating system modification that is easily deployed, can certify files that are created, and ensures that any user can automatically check the authenticity of files across any existing application or platform. VeracOS invents a unique algorithm for certifying and verifying files. VeracOS aims to revolutionize the war against misinformation and exploitation of fake content by introducing several key features: VeracOS allows users or corporations to easily and automatically certify their media. Unlike existing solutions, VeracOS avoids intensive computations, specialized hardware, and private data sharing. VeracOS also allows any user to automatically be notified if the file they are viewing is verified to be authentic. VeracOS does not require the modification of existing applications nor does it require the sharing of private information such as what files or media are being viewed by a user. These key features provide a highly portable and easily deployed system for users of any operating system, including Internet of Things devices and mobile operating systems. Using media files such as images and videos as exemplary file types and using Android as an exemplary operating system, a VeracOS prototype was implemented to allow any user to automatically certify or verify their media files. The results show that VeracOS is easy to use and can be easily run on smartphones without the need for specialized systems, applications, or hardware.},

However, empirical research on GenAI education approaches is scarce. This study investigates the prevalence of protective-preventive, critical-reflective, and creative-productive GenAI education approaches in highly digitized Swiss upper secondary schools and how students' experiences of these approaches relate to two aspects of their digital agency: GenAI confidence and GenAI responsibility. Using data from 2357 students, the results showed that the critical-reflective approach was the most commonly experienced and significantly predicted students’ GenAI confidence and responsibility. The creative-productive approach positively and significantly predicted GenAI confidence but not responsibility, while the protective-preventive approach, although the second most common approach, was not significantly related to either outcome. However, these approaches explained little variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that they may not yet be effectively implemented or that digital agency is primarily developed outside schools. Analysis of the control variables showed that identifying as a female had a negative significant effect on GenAI confidence and a positive significant effect on GenAI responsibility. The findings highlight the importance of adopting a critical-reflective GenAI education approach with attention to gender issues in fostering responsible and confident digital citizens.},

In the realm of open radio access networks (O-RAN), characterized by their disaggregated architecture and heterogeneous components from multiple vendors, the deployment of generative models offers significant advantages for network management such as traffic analysis, traffic forecasting and anomaly detection. However, the complex and dynamic nature of O-RAN introduces challenges that necessitate not only accurate detection mechanisms but also reduced complexity, scalability, and most importantly interpretability to facilitate effective network management. In this study, we introduce the XAInomaly framework, an explainable and interpretable Semi-supervised (SS) Deep Contractive Autoencoder (DeepCAE) design for anomaly detection in O-RAN. Our approach leverages the generative modeling capabilities of our SS-DeepCAE model to learn compressed, robust representations of normal network behavior, which captures essential features, enabling the identification of deviations indicative of anomalies. To address the black-box nature of deep learning models, we propose reactive Explainable AI (XAI) technique called fastshap-C, which is providing transparency into the model’s decision-making process and highlighting the features contributing to anomaly detection.},

As the sector evolves toward the Aquaculture 4.0 vision of intelligent, interconnected, and sustainable systems, GAI offers transformative capabilities across perception, planning, optimization, and communication. GAI enhances automation, decision support, and situational awareness across the aquaculture value chain through the intelligent synthesis of multimodal data ranging from sensor logs and underwater imagery to textual records and simulations. This review presents the first comprehensive synthesis of GAI in aquaculture, covering foundational models (e.g., diffusion models, transformers, and GANs), domain-specific applications, and emerging deployment scenarios. We demonstrate how GAI drives industry innovation in areas such as ROV-based infrastructure inspection, digital twins for farm design, synthetic data generation for fish health diagnostics, multimodal sensor fusion, and personalized advisory systems. Importantly, we map GAI models to specific aquaculture tasks, highlighting their suitability and advantages. We also offer a critical assessment of their operational readiness, including trust, performance, and environmental impact issues. In addition, we provide a systematic classification of applications, case studies, and future directions to guide the responsible and scalable integration of GAI in aquaculture.

    abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into educational contexts, its impact on students’ creative thinking remains unclear. Given the critical role of creativity in engineering and design education, understanding how AI tools shape students’ ideation processes is essential for developing effective pedagogical practices. This study examines the impact of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, on creative ideation among undergraduate design engineering students. The research was conducted through a randomised crossover experiment, with students alternating between AI-assisted and unaided ideation tasks. A mixed-methods approach combined quantitative analyses of the 728 ideas generated with a qualitative evaluation of students’ interactions with AI. Results show that the use of AI did not reduce fluency, flexibility, or originality, nor did it lead to thematic homogenisation. However, semantic divergence was significantly lower in the AI-assisted condition, suggesting convergence in the way ideas were formulated. Additionally, AI-assisted ideas more frequently resembled existing products and exhibited reduced textual elaboration. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA revealed that students who began with AI support produced more original and diverse ideas across both tasks, pointing to a lasting effect of early AI use. Qualitative analysis of student-AI interactions revealed important patterns, including predominantly passive and directive use, with limited exploratory or collaborative engagement. These findings provide new insights into human-AI co-creation and highlight the importance of promoting intentional, critical, and pedagogically guided use of generative AI tools in education.},

    abstract = {Context:
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming much of software development, yet its application in software architecture is still in its infancy.
Aim:
Systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and challenges of GenAI in software architecture.
Method:
Multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, reported challenges, and extracting themes via open coding.
Results:
This review identifies a significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to the initial stages of the Software Architecture Life Cycle (SALC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the main targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks.
Conclusions:
GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but there are several challenges on its way towards greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to overcome the gap between theoretical possibility and practical use.

Faculty redesigned a drug information (DI) assignment to incorporate generative artificial intelligence (AI), encouraging the responsible use of AI to craft DI responses. The purpose of this study was to explore pharmacy students' perceptions of using AI tools in DI assignments and the value of AI-enabled assignments in health professions education.
Educational activity
A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted of third-year pharmacy students' narrative reflections after completing an AI-enabled team DI assignment in a Spring 2024 critical care elective. The steps to complete the DI assignment were: 1) create an AI-generated response to a DI question, 2) critique the AI output, 3) complete an individual literature search, 4) synthesize a final team DI submission, 5) reflect. Student AI use at baseline and anticipated use following the assignment were collected via a pre−/post- course survey.
Evaluation findings
Twenty-one students were enrolled in the course and submitted narrative reflections on the DI assignment. Most students stated that prior to the assignment they had never employed the use of AI for professional or academic reasons (n = 14/20; 70 %). Two themes, describing benefits and challenges, and six sub-themes were identified from the reflective statements: user benefits, awareness of AI and its capabilities, quality of the AI response, skepticism, user responsibility, and limitations of AI.
Analysis of educational activity
Through narrative reflection, students identified benefits and challenges of integrating AI into a DI assignment. While AI enhanced efficiency, students emphasized the importance of ensuring the validity and detail of the AI-generated DI question response.},

This study investigates learning effectiveness and psychological responses, including flow, perceived fidelity, cognitive load, and qualitative feedback, and specifically analyzes the behavioral patterns of learners interacting with generative artificial intelligence. A total of 91 participants were enrolled in this study and divided into three groups: experimental group 1 (generative artificial intelligence interactive metacognitive scaffolding), experimental group 2 (video metacognitive scaffolding), and control group (text metacognitive scaffolding). The results showed that students in the generative artificial intelligence group responded with higher perceived fidelity and were significantly better than the control group with text-based metacognitive scaffolding in terms of learning effectiveness, flow, and germane cognitive load. Behavioral pattern analysis reveals that learners can effectively obtain a lot of positive help in solving tasks through positive interactions with non-player character chatbot. This framework and the findings of the study can be used as a reference for related studies in the field of game-based learning in the use of metacognitive scaffolding, contextual learning, and generative AI. Due to the short experimental period, the results may only reflect the short-term learning effects, and the novelty of Gen AI may also cause bias in affecting the learning outcomes, future studies can increase the duration or number of experiences, and explore the effectiveness in other professional domains.},

The graph representation encodes structural elements as edges and their connections as nodes, maintaining critical dimensional constraints and spatial relationships. Using data from bamboo stilt houses built without architects, we make a specialized dataset of geometric skeletons for model training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing the distribution of featured elements in building frameworks and in generating structurally sound designs, with GraphSAGE showing better performance compared to alternative methods. The probabilistic edge prediction approach allows for a collaborative human-AI design process, empowering designers while utilizing computational capabilities.

    abstract = {High gas sensitivity materials are crucial for the development of high-performance gas sensors. Traditionally, obtaining such materials has relied on trial and error, a process that is time-consuming, resource-intensive and laborious. In this study, an intelligent predictive framework using a generative artificial intelligence model is presented, which predicts the gas sensitivity of target materials with remarkable speed and accuracy. To validate the proposed framework, a material database is constructed using ZnO doped with eight different metal atoms, which serves as representative materials. Subsequently, 25 physical parameters, including crystal structure and electronic structure, are calculated using first-principles calculations. Eight intelligent learning models are then trained to predict sensitivity, with the Extremely Randomized Trees model performing the best, achieving a mean square error of 0.02. By combining feature engineering with generative artificial intelligence models, a novel model based on intrinsic atomic features (radius, electronegativity, first ionization energy) is developed, which enables the prediction of CO gas sensitivity in doped ZnO using the generated 12 key parameters, without any parameters from first principle calculation, thus significantly reducing the time and cost associated with discovering gas-sensitive properties. This predictive framework can be easily extended to other materials, facilitating the functional development of materials.},

The antimicrobial resistance crisis necessitates structurally distinct antibiotics. While deep learning approaches can identify antibacterial compounds from existing libraries, structural novelty remains limited. Here, we developed a generative artificial intelligence framework for designing de novo antibiotics through two approaches: a fragment-based method to comprehensively screen >107 chemical fragments in silico against Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Staphylococcus aureus, subsequently expanding promising fragments, and an unconstrained de novo compound generation, each using genetic algorithms and variational autoencoders. Of 24 synthesized compounds, seven demonstrated selective antibacterial activity. Two lead compounds exhibited bactericidal efficacy against multidrug-resistant isolates with distinct mechanisms of action and reduced bacterial burden in vivo in mouse models of N. gonorrhoeae vaginal infection and methicillin-resistant S. aureus skin infection. We further validated structural analogs for both compound classes as antibacterial. Our approach enables the generative deep-learning-guided design of de novo antibiotics, providing a platform for mapping uncharted regions of chemical space.},

Simulation results showcase LMDM's ability to refine system configurations through human guidance, transforming digital twins into human-centric decision-making tools.},

    abstract = {Controversial technologies are technologies where social concerns play a disproportionate role in shaping the public attitudes to their adoption. An example of such controversial technologies is Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), whose rapid diffusion is fuelled by expectations for significant performance improvements, while also facing concerns at individual (trust in technology), technology (accuracy and quality), and institutional (cultural, ethical and regulatory) level. Individual and technology factors are well accounted for by rational choice-based models which underpin most technology acceptance research. Such models are less suited to explore the role of institutional factors in shaping technology acceptance. Drawing from legitimacy and technology lifecycle research, we develop a legitimacy-based model of GenAI adoption which accounts for the institutional context in which technology use happens, and for technology characteristics, namely its maturity, in shaping users' acceptance. Surveying 483 information systems students who are GenAI users, we find that users' perceptions of technology uncertainty and variation positively affect their technology legitimacy evaluations and that their pragmatic and cognitive legitimacy evaluations, but not moral, affect their intention to use. We answer recent calls to examine alternative theoretical predictors of technology acceptance, and to consider the role of context in examining the acceptance of controversial technologies.},

This study examines recent research developments and application trends of AIGC in educational content production, emphasizing individualized learning content generation techniques utilizing AIGC technology and its usefulness in practical applications. Initially, by employing educational resource libraries and learning behavior data, data quality is augmented, and analytical efficiency is refined by preprocessing techniques including data cleansing, resource categorization and labeling, multimodal alignment, and consistency verification. Subsequently, the Transformer architecture is employed to extract learning characteristics from behavioral data, while content relevance is augmented via knowledge point embedding and multimodal content production. A reinforcement learning approach is incorporated to execute a feedback-driven dynamic optimization procedure. Ultimately, comparison trials confirm the substantial benefits of the AIGC-based individualized learning material generation method in enhancing generation efficiency, optimizing resource flexibility, and improving learning outcomes. AIGC enhances educational quality by producing tailored learning materials, so effectively advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 4) for excellent education.

    abstract = {Nowadays, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools or trainable agents can craft synthetic media (hereafter referred to as deepfakes) in the form of realistic texts, images, videos, and audios, incorporating events or things that never occurred in real life. These GenAI tools empower marketers and malicious actors to create deepfakes, both authorized and weaponized multimedia, which allows them to include celebrities without appearing in front of cameras or creating seductive phishing scams. Although GenAI tools can reduce the cost of content construction, they enable new risky opportunities (e.g., deepfake phishing and cyberbullying) that negatively impact netizens’ learning and (dis)trust behaviors in cyberspace. To address such risks, this study proposes a Multi-Criteria-Multi-Decision-Makers (MCMDM)-based Deepfake Risk Assessment Framework (DeepFakeR-MF) to evaluate determinant factors that impact the cyber (dis)trust behaviors of netizens in deepfakes. Moreover, DeepFakeR-MF deploys a combination of a novel optimized spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method and a game theory-based MCMDM approach to prioritize and recommend alternative strategies that can be taken by five management sectors (e.g., industrial enterprises, governmental organizations, media outlets, social non-profit, and educational institutes) to mitigate GenAI-associated risks. Then, we collect 100 experts’ judgments by analyzing their responses to our questionnaire and prioritize the importance of determinant factors considering their preferences. To validate the prioritized factors on the performance of DeepFakeR-MF, we conduct a sensitivity analysis applying Monte Carlo statistical modeling. Finally, our results confirm that DeepFakeR-MF provides effective strategic alternatives for policymakers, educators, media professionals, engineers, and netizens, hopefully reducing the socio-economic risks of deepfakes.},

    abstract = {Aircraft conceptual design is a critical step in the development and research of aircraft, involving complex processes and multiple disciplines. Improving the efficiency of aircraft conceptual design while ensuring quality is an important challenge. Intelligent technologies such as neural networks have played significant roles in areas like aerodynamics and structural analysis. However, due to issues such as high data demands and difficulties in transfer learning, their application in the conceptual design phase has been limited. The rise of generative artificial intelligence, exemplified by Large Language Model (LLM), offers a new approach to this problem. Therefore, this study proposes a methodology for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions based on LLMs and develops a prototype system. First, four of the current best-performing general-purpose LLMs are selected for deployment as foundational models. Then, based on the general prompt framework of LLMs, schema for aircraft conceptual design solutions, and real-world design cases, task prompts for generating aircraft conceptual design solutions are crafted, resulting in three types of prompts: Full-Instruction, 1-Shot, and 5-Shot. Finally, the prototype system is utilized to design conceptual solutions, and the model-generated solutions are compared with those designed by engineers from both objective and subjective perspectives. The experimental results indicate that LLMs demonstrate conceptual design capabilities comparable to those of engineers, exhibiting strong generalization ability and potential for innovative design.},

In the face of the emergence of constantly evolving forgery techniques, we need a detection model with strong generalization and high robustness to deal with them. In this work, we propose a Robust and Unified Spoofing Audio Detection (RUSAD) scheme, which is capable of dealing with multiple attacks such as logic attacks, replay attacks and adversarial attacks. We propose an innovative scheme from the perspectives of upstream feature extraction and downstream spoofing classification: the self-supervised upstream learning model based on the Conformer network extracts speech representations, establishes probabilistic spectrum-augmentation events to improve model robustness against adversarial attacks, and formulate multiple decoding tasks for classification and regression; downstream classification of audio spoofing based on inference of the SE-ResNeXt network, supplemented by self-attention pooling and the OC-Softmax angular loss function in order to improve classification performance. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on both the ASVspoof2021 and ADD2023 datasets. The results show that the scheme has improved performance, generalization, and robustness in comparison to the baseline system as well as to most forensic countermeasures, which are capable of achieving the goal of dealing with multiple attacks.},

Through systematic searching of academic databases and grey literature between 2020 and 2024, this scoping literature review examined the emerging landscape of GenAI applications in supporting neurodivergent students (e.g., those with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, gifted, twice-exceptional) within K-12 educational contexts. Twenty-one relevant sources were identified, discussing GenAI usage with neurodivergent students, the analysis revealed discussion of several predominant applications, including personalized learning, administrative assistance for educators, and development of individualized education plans. The review identified both promising approaches and significant concerns. Benefits included GenAI's potential to provide real-time, personalized support for students as well as reducing administrative burdens for educators. However, notable concerns emerged regarding information accuracy, over-reliance on AI, privacy considerations, and the need for human oversight. The limited empirical evidence base was particularly striking, with only nine studies providing original research data. The review identified critical gaps in current understanding, particularly regarding GenAI's effectiveness across different neurodivergent conditions and curriculum areas, and little evidence of approaches detailed in ways that educators could use. This scoping review demonstrates the need for robust empirical research examining GenAI usage in learning for neurodivergent students. These insights are timely and crucial for educators, researchers, and policymakers working to harness GenAI's potential in supporting neurodivergent learners within inclusive educational environments.},

Existing generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI)-based visualization approaches often lack alignment with biophilic design principles, resulting in outputs that fail to reflect the restorative qualities of nature-integrated spaces. To address this limitation, the study links generative visualization processes to established biophilic frameworks, thereby enhancing the applicability of Gen AI in sustainable and human-centered architectural practice. The methodology follows a three-stage process: (1) exploration of biophilic visualization requirements through literature review and prompt testing, (2) development of the framework through domain-specific dataset construction, text mining, and prompt curation, and (3) expert evaluation of images generated using the structured prompts. The proposed framework consists of five components—subject, attribute, mood, time and background, and negative prompt—to guide the generation of BAS visualizations systematically. The generated images were assessed based on five criteria: domain fidelity, visual coherence, depth and perspective, spatial integration, and overall biophilic appeal. Results demonstrated substantial improvements—up to 75 % in domain fidelity and over 60 % in spatial integration and biophilic appeal—compared to early-tested prompts. These findings underscore the potential of structured prompts, grounded in biophilic design theory, to enhance the effectiveness of AI visualizations. This study offers a replicable and scalable method for integrating nature-based design principles into early-stage spatial planning. It provides design professionals with a practical tool to visualize restorative environments and promote sustainable architectural practice.},

    abstract = {The application of generative artificial intelligence technology in the field of visual design is increasingly widespread, particularly showing significant potential in scientific publications. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional journal cover design and enhance the artistic quality and communicative effectiveness of journal covers, this study proposes a method for designing international scientific journal covers driven by artificial intelligence. The method integrates numerous generative artificial intelligence technologies and multi-criteria decision-making methods, applying them to the design practice of food science journals, thereby improving the efficiency of journal cover design and publication. The integrated method first uses the coding method of grounded theory to extract five design dimensions critical to journal cover design and constructs a triple-mapping relationship model of technological translatability, visual expressiveness, and alignment with public cognition and cultural background, providing a research foundation for organizing design elements to align with the journal’s positioning. The DeepSeek large language model is employed to generate creative keywords for the journal cover, which are then translated into descriptive instructions recognizable by Midjourney. Subsequently, Midjourney is used to generate preliminary cover sketches to quickly visualise the creative concept, and the controlnet function of Stable Diffusion is employed to control the outline of the sketch’s line art, followed by experimentation and optimisation across dimensions such as visual style and tonal range. Finally, the VIKOR method is applied to evaluate and rank the six generated cover design proposals. The evaluation criteria encompass scientific content expression, visual aesthetics, and communication and acceptance, across three dimensions with fifteen indicators. The selected design proposals are then subjected to collaborative optimisation between human input and artificial intelligence. The integrated method offers a systematic and innovative framework, enhancing the efficiency, creativity, and visual impact of journal cover design, and provides both theoretical and practical references for future academic publishing.},

    abstract = {The unannounced appearance of GenAI in 2022 and the speed of its adoption by researchers have left many questions unanswered about its accepted ethical use, with no apparent consensus among applied linguists. In this context, it’s essential for researchers to develop their GenAI literacy for research to engage with GenAI effectively and responsibly. This study contributes to identifying key components of this literacy through examining accepted GenAI uses in research practices. Based on a systematically sampled collection of 170 high-impact journals in applied linguistics, we investigated the scope and nature of GenAI use guidelines provided by 76 journals intended to guide authors. A checklist including four items regarding general statements and 17 items regarding three categories of specific aspects that GenAI guidelines target (authorship, uses, and human responsibility) was identified. Our findings reveal that (1) less than half of the journals provided GenAI use guidelines to guide authors, (2) the number of specific aspects varied across journals, with most falling short of comprehensive coverage, and (3) disagreements were observed about whether AI can be cited and used for manuscript drafting, idea generating, image generating, data generation, data collection, and data analysis and interpretation. Additionally, journals varied in their guidance on how to disclose GenAI uses. We propose recommendations for journals in improving their AI guidelines. Importantly, we introduce and conceptualize the new construct GenAI literacy for research article writing (GenAI-LR) that is important for authors to develop. We provide actionable recommendations accordingly based on our findings.},

    abstract = {Represented by ChatGPT, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is revolutionizing the field of education. Despite a series of related studies and reviews around GAI, existing reviews predominantly focus on macro-level discussions covering overall development trends, core issues, opportunities and risks. There has been a lack of systematic reviews from a meso-level perspective examining the application of GAI in classroom teaching within higher education. This study employs a systematic literature review method, examining 139 articles from Web of Science, EBSCO, and Scopus databases. Findings include: (1)In terms of disciplines and types of GAI applications, engineering, health and medicine, and language are the most popular, while humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, mathematics, sports sciences, and interdisciplinary fields have fewer applications. Based on Strobel's classification of GAI(2024), it is found that Generators, Reimaginators, and Assistants are the most widely applied types of GAI. In contrast, Synthesizers and Enablers are less commonly utilized. Regarding the adoption trends across disciplines, engineering and language have a diverse range of GAI product types applied, whereas health and medicine has fewer types of GAI products in use. Due to smaller sample sizes, the analysis of GAI product types in the remaining six disciplines is also relatively limited. (2)In terms of the application of GAI across different disciplines, a small portion of GAI applications reflect distinctive disciplinary characteristics. Regarding the roles mapped out by the application of GAI, based on Xu and Ouyang's classification(2022), instructors or students predominantly perceive GAI as “New Subject” or “Direct Mediator", with less emphasis on the role of “Supplement Assistant”. Regarding the integration into the classroom, as assessed through the SAMR framework, most GAI applications are in the Augmentation level. There are also some in the Substitution and Modification levels, while applications in the Redefinition level are relatively rare. (3)In terms of the selection of instructional strategies under GAI applications, there are 18 types of strategies across four orientations, primarily emphasizing constructive and reflective orientations. Strategies focusing on didactic and authentic orientiations are less frequently utilized. Regarding the roles GAI plays as reflected in instructional strategies, it predominantly assumes roles as “New Subject” and “Direct Mediator", with the role of “Supplementary Assistant” yet to be explored. Finally, this study evaluated the instructional application research of GAI from three dimensions: GAI product type and applied discipline, discipline-specific application and integration level, instructional strategies and GAI role, and put forward relevant research suggestions.},

    abstract = {Building energy performance forecasting (BEPF) is an active area of research with the potential to improve the efficiency of building energy management systems, support global sustainability goals, and mitigate climate change impacts. This systematic review examines three main prediction methods: model-driven, data-driven, and hybrid-driven, each with different principles, basics, advantages, disadvantages, practical applications, challenges, and limitations in addressing the complexities of building energy performance. The review focuses on key influencing factors, including building features, climatic conditions, and occupant behavior, while identifying critical research gaps in current methodologies. Through a bibliometric analysis of 95 relevant publications from 2019 to 2024, this review provides a quantitative overview of research progress and emerging trends. Findings indicate that although BEPF techniques have evolved rapidly, most studies continue to overlook the variability and complexity of occupant behavior, a factor with significantly affects forecast accuracy. To address this, we propose a modular AI-integrated forecasting framework that leverages the strengths of existing approaches, integrates real-time IoT data, and incorporate advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as generative Artificial Intelligence, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). A decision-making framework is also introduced to guide method selection based on specific building characteristics, data availability, desired accuracy, and operational goals, offering practical guidance for engineering and policy applications. Additionally, future research should extend beyond individual building dynamics to include a wider range of community-level determinants, such as policy frameworks, economic factors, and social determinants of health considerations (SDOH), aiming for a more comprehensive understanding of building energy consumption patterns. This review not only synthesizes current knowledge but also lays the foundation for future innovations in BEPF. We advocate for moving towards an AI-enhanced, adaptive forecasting model that can integrate different driven methods, capture the variability and unpredictability of occupant behavior, and improve the accuracy and reliability of energy forecasts.},

This article presents a taxonomy of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), explores emerging applications, outlines methods to improve the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated outputs, and describes current limitations.
Methods
Foundational generative AI concepts are defined, and current HEOR applications are highlighted, including for systematic literature reviews, health economic modeling, real-world evidence generation, and dossier development. Techniques such as prompt engineering (eg, zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and persona pattern prompting), retrieval-augmented generation, model fine-tuning, domain-specific models, and the use of agents are introduced to enhance AI performance. Limitations associated with the use of generative AI foundation models are described.
Results
Generative AI demonstrates significant potential in HEOR, offering enhanced efficiency, productivity, and innovative solutions to complex challenges. Although foundation models show promise in automating complex tasks, challenges persist in scientific accuracy and reproducibility, bias and fairness, and operational deployment. Strategies to address these issues and improve AI accuracy are discussed.
Conclusions
Generative AI has the potential to transform HEOR by improving efficiency and accuracy across diverse applications. However, realizing this potential requires building HEOR expertise and addressing the limitations of current AI technologies. Ongoing research and innovation will be key to shaping AI’s future role in our field.},

@article{BRITOZERON20252097,
    abstract = {Background:
Complement consumption, characterized by decreased C3 and/or C4 levels, is a hallmark of immune complex-mediated inflammation and vascular involvement in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. In patients with Sjögren Disease (SjD), hypocomplementemia at diagnosis has been mainly linked to an increased risk of lymphoma. By analysing the relationship between complement consumption profiles and systemic activity in the largest international cohort, we aim to refine early prognostic paradigms and inform tailored clinical surveillance strategies in SjD, thereby addressing a critical gap in precision medicine for this complex autoimmune disease.
Objectives:
The objectives of this study were to identify and classify complement consumption patterns, investigate their association with an early phenotype consisting of systemic activity across ESSDAI domains while adjusting for age and gender, and explore how cross-validation techniques may validate the predictive accuracy and generalizability of developed models.
Methods:
This study analyzed data from the International Sjögren Big Data Registry. Patients were categorized into four distinct groups according to their complement consumption patterns (isolated low C3, isolated low C4, combined low C3 and C4, and normal C3 and C4 levels). We used Chi-square tests to evaluate univariate associations, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Mann-Whitney U test to investigate significant differences with respect to systemic activity (mean ESSDAI score and DAS categories). Multivariable logistic regression models were developed to analyze associations between complement patterns and ESSDAI domains, adjusting for age and gender. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A five-fold stratified cross-validation was carried out to rigorously evaluate the models' generalizability, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) serving as the primary performance metric. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) (ChatGPT-4o model) was used within a secure offline environment to automate anonymized data recoding and statistical scripting. Python libraries, including pandas, statsmodels, and scikit-learn, were integral for data processing, model development, and cross-validation.
Results:
Complement values determined at diagnosis were available in 13,710 patients. Stratification according to the 4 complement consumption patterns identified that 79.58% of patients had normal levels of C3 and C4, 7.42% exhibited isolated low C3, 6.90% showed isolated low C4, and 6.09% presented combined low C3 and C4 levels. Combined low C3-C4 levels exhibited the highest mean ESSDAI score (11.41), follwed by isolated low C3, isolated low C4 and normocomplementemia (mean ESSDAI score of 9.26, 7.39, and 5.66, respectively) (Figure 1); Kruskal-Wallis H-test revealed a highly significant difference between the groups (p<0.001), as well as pairwise comparisons using the Mann-Whitney U test (p<0.001). The Chi-square test revealed significant differences in the distribution of DAS categories across the C3-C4 combined groups (χ2=476.41, p<0.001) (Figure 2). However, multivariate logistic regression confirmed significant associations in only three domains. For the pulmonary domain, combined low C3 and C4 levels were associated with the highest odds of activity (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 2.50–3.91, p < 0.001; AUC: 0.591). In the biological domain, isolated low C3 strongly correlated with activity (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.98–3.03, p < 0.001; AUC: 0.580). For constitutional symptoms, isolated low C3 was associated with the highest activity frequency (18.54%), whereas normal complement levels showed the lowest frequency (11.06%, OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.48–0.67, p < 0.001; AUC: 0.563). After adjusting for epidemiological factors, sex and age emerged as influential variables: men had higher odds of constitutional activity (OR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.02–1.52, p = 0.03), while older age had a protective effect, reducing systemic activity by about 1% per year (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99–1.00, p = 0.0003). The AUC values obtained after running the five-fold stratified cross-validation generalizability models ranged between 0.56 and 0.59, indicating modest ability to discriminate between active and inactive states.
Conclusion:
This study demonstrates that complement consumption patterns are strongly associated with baseline systemic activity in SjD, highlighting their potential as early prognostic markers. While complement patterns provide valuable insights for risk stratification, the current predictive models exhibit modest discriminatory ability (AUC values between 0.5 and 0.6), suggesting that complement patterns are relevant but insufficient alone as predictors to improve clinical applicability. The nuanced influence of epidemiological factors—such as the protective effect of age and the increased susceptibility of men to systemic disease—adds complexity to our understanding of early systemic Sjögren.

    abstract = {As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools become increasingly integrated into educational environments, concerns have emerged about their potential to facilitate academic dishonesty. Drawing on the modified theory of planned behavior, this study aimed to understand undergraduate students’ academic cheating behaviors using GenAI. The study conducted a mixed-method approach, utilizing focus groups and polls to gather insights from 25 undergraduate students enrolled in a course that incorporated GenAI into its pedagogical design in the United States. The results revealed that the integration of GenAI into higher education is perceived as inevitable. While students clearly recognized overt cheating, opinions varied regarding subtle forms of dishonesty and the effectiveness of formal deterrents. Peer influence and personal ethics were found to strongly shape cheating behaviors, with class policies enforced by instructors exerting a greater influence on student cheating behavior with GenAI than broader institutional policies. These insights can assist educators and policymakers in managing the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of GenAI technologies into education.},

Traditional DHODH inhibitor discovery is slow and costly. Our study integrated machine learning (ML) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate this process, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs. We employed Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Logistic Regression (LR) to predict pIC50 values, with RF achieving the highest accuracy (93 % test accuracy, 81 % on unseen molecules), demonstrating superior generalization. Using a Graph Convolutional Network-based Variational Autoencoder (GCN-VAE), we generated 59 unique drug-like molecules, five with pIC50 > 7, expanding the chemical space beyond conventional screening. Docking studies confirmed strong binding affinities, with the most promising newly generated molecule showing a binding energy of –11.1 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant (Ki) of 269.8 nM. Key interactions with residues such as ALA59, PHE36, TYR38, GLN47, and ARG36 further validated stability and inhibitory potential. This AI-driven workflow accelerates DHODH inhibitor discovery by significantly reducing screening time, enhancing molecular diversity, and improving predictive accuracy. Our approach presents a scalable, cost-effective strategy for developing novel therapeutics, offering a transformative shift in drug discovery.},

    abstract = {Capturing the time evolution and predicting kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems present significant challenges due to the precision and computational effort required. In this study, we demonstrate that ‘Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)’, an artificial intelligence model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories akin to the vocabulary corpus of a language, we show that a GPT-based model can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables GPT to predict kinetically accurate sequences of states for a diverse set of biomolecules of varying complexity, at a much quicker pace than traditional MD simulations and with a better efficiency than other baseline time-series prediction approaches. More significantly, the approach is found to be equally adept at forecasting the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium active systems that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of the mechanism inherent in GPT reveals the crucial role of the ‘self-attention mechanism’ in capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Together, our results highlight generative artificial intelligence's ability to generate kinetic sequences of states of physicochemical systems with statistical precision.},

    abstract = {Purpose
Technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), is transforming the way we work; however, it is yet to systemically transform learning at the workplace beyond augmentation of formal education’s learning processes. This paper derives functional requirements for technologies that support workplace learning and assesses the suitability and limitations of generative AI conversational agents, as an example of application.
Design/methodology/approach
Using activity theory (AT) as theoretical framework, we model workplace learning as an activity, intertwined with work and mediated by technology, and expose contradictions that arise when technology developed for formal education is adopted at work. From these tensions, we derive functional requirements and illustrate their use by comparing them to ChatGPT’s affordances.
Findings
A framework is proposed for design and assessment of enabling technologies for workplace learning. In applying it to ChatGPT, as paradigm of conversational agents, we find the aspects that are particularly suitable to enhance workplace learning, and those that need further development.
Originality/value
The theoretical approach is novel. Previous research is based on reported use-cases of enabling technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), in the workplace or on the analysis of the learner’s experience when these technologies are embedded in structured training modules. The present study addresses the limitations of current retrospective research, providing a forward-looking approach.},

However, research on the factors influencing user behavior toward these applications remains limited. This study applies the coping theory of user adaptation to examine how various cognitive appraisals and coping responses affect users' trust and engagement with GenAI image systems (GenAI-IS). This study consists of two studies. The first qualitative study involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 20 respondents from diverse backgrounds to identify the benefits and risks associated with GenAI-IS. The second quantitative study uses structural equation modeling, moderation analysis, and simple slope analysis to test the proposed hypotheses based on an online survey of 980 GenAI-IS users. The results show that economic efficiency and aesthetic quality—two key benefits of GenAI-IS—positively influence perceived value, while the devaluation of human creativity and copyright infringement—two primary risks identified—positively influence perceived threat. Perceived value fosters trust and engagement with the GenAI-IS, whereas perceived threat negatively influences both. Additionally, perceived controllability represents a secondary appraisal influencing trust and engagement. Compatibility moderates the relationships among perceived threat, trust, and engagement. These findings contribute to the literature on AI-generated content and user interactions.},

    abstract = {The unprecedented popularity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (henceforth “GenAI”) tools like ChatGPT and Gemini has the potential to disrupt the education sector in general. The initial reactions from educators have drawn a mixed response about the application of GenAI in management education, where some consider it a ‘watershed’ phenomenon, while others consider it an ‘existential threat’ to the teaching-learning system. Subscribing to the positive view, this paper argues that educators must promote the responsible use of AI-based tools, and imposing any artificial restraint on the application of GenAI technology can be deleterious to students' advancement. This is because GenAI will automate future jobs and create new jobs that do not exist today. As organizations are moving towards skill-based hiring, management education must prepare graduates with the requisite technical and human skills required for future jobs. However, previous studies have invested a lot of attention towards the technical aspect of the integration of GenAI tools by recommending capacity development programs to understand the nuances of new technology. However, they have overlooked the important aspect of adopting technology, i.e., attitudes and behavioral rigidities among educators. For this purpose, we argue that to overcome such a rigid mindset, institutions must focus on an unlearning mechanism comprising three phases: destabilizing triggers, discarding existing practices, and experimenting with new ones to help educators adopt GenAI tools in the education system. This study offers multiple theoretical and practical implications. It is a response to a call from researchers to apply existing theories to inform management scholarship about the implementation of GenAI technology and overcome educators' apprehensions that impede the ethical application of GenAI in management education.},

Methods build on prior work establishing qualitative analysis enhanced by Natural Language Processing (NLP) by stacking multiple iterative coding processes with GenAI and humans-in-the-loop to generate qualitative codebooks. A comparative analysis establishes recommendations for assessing the validity of the GPT-enabled generated codebooks. Human validation confirmed substantial concordance (91.7% agreement) with the GPT-enabled process's coding, revealing structural similarities and distinct patterns between the two approaches’ representation of analysis. This research's contribution is methodological, establishing an approach for conducting and assessing GPT-enabled qualitative analysis while mapping relationships between computationally enhanced and traditional qualitative coding approaches. Findings advance risk communication methods by offering empirical guidance on integrating AI-assisted techniques within traditional qualitative research to maintain analytical rigor. Compared to prior NLP-enabled methods for disaster-related social media discourse analysis, this iterative approach mimics aspects of traditional qualitative codebook development, yielding multi-tiered codebook structures that can capture aspects of complex disaster discourse. While findings demonstrate that GenAI can enable analytical efficiency of traditional (human-only) codebook generation through self-assessment and iterative improvement with the help of humans-in-the-loop, they also illuminate areas of coding process where human expertise remains essential.},

Finally, nonconsensual sexual deepfakes can impair the economic and moral rights of pornography performers by abusing their work and bodies to abuse others without authorization and compensation.

    abstract = {ABSTRACT
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly recognized as a transformative force in education, offering innovative ways to improve teaching and learning. However, integrating these technologies into educational settings poses significant challenges. Teachers often express skepticism and anxiety about implementing GenAI tools due to various factors (e.g., lack of familiarity and concerns about job displacement). This study aimed to investigate the level of AI anxiety (AIA) among Iranian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers, focusing on their perceptions of GenAI tools such as ChatGPT in language teaching. In addition, the research examined differences in AI anxiety based on demographic variables such as age, gender, teaching experience, field of study, and educational level. A total of 444 Iranian EFL teachers from different language education institutions participated in the study, with data collected through an online questionnaire. The results revealed moderate level of AIA among EFL teachers. The study also showed that there were no statistically significant differences in AIA based on the gender, age, field of study, and highest level of education. However, significant difference in AIA among EFL teachers based on their teaching experience was revealed. Specifically, EFL teachers with fewer years of teaching experience (1-3 years) tended to have significantly lower AIA compared to those with moderate teaching experience (4-20 years). To address AIA among EFL teachers, targeted professional development programs should be implemented to enhance teachers’ AI literacy and confidence. Additionally, educational institutions should ensure that AI implementation is accompanied by clear guidelines and pedagogical frameworks to alleviate concerns about job security and teaching autonomy.},

Yet, for practitioners, adoption remains complex because of limited resources and the demands of existing operations. This study explores how firms manage these challenges by examining AI adoption through the lens of the exploration–exploitation trade-off. Using data from public company filings, we analyze adoption rates, drivers and barriers, links to R&D investment, and industry-specific patterns. We find that firms with lower employee efficiency and greater size adopt AI more readily. AI adoption also correlates with changes in the scale and focus of R&D spending. Notably, retail and services firms—among the least efficient in terms of labor productivity—are leading in AI uptake. However, their focus remains on automating routine tasks and expanding product offerings, rather than investing in workforce development. These results provide useful guidance for leaders who want to use AI effectively, particularly in industries needing to improve employee productivity.},

    abstract = {There is a critical need for community engagement in the process of adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in public health. Public health practitioners and researchers have historically innovated in areas like vaccination and sanitation but have been slower in adopting emerging technologies such as generative AI. However, with increasingly complex funding, programming, and research requirements, the field now faces a pivotal moment to enhance its agility and responsiveness to evolving health challenges. Participatory methods and community engagement are key components of many current public health programs and research. The field of public health is well positioned to ensure community engagement is part of AI technologies applied to population health issues. Without such engagement, the adoption of these technologies in public health may exclude significant portions of the population, particularly those with the fewest resources, with the potential to exacerbate health inequities. Risks to privacy and perpetuation of bias are more likely to be avoided if AI technologies in public health are designed with knowledge of community engagement, existing health disparities, and strategies for improving equity. This viewpoint proposes a multifaceted approach to ensure safer and more effective integration of AI in public health with the following call to action: (1) include the basics of AI technology in public health training and professional development; (2) use a community engagement approach to co-design AI technologies in public health; and (3) introduce governance and best practice mechanisms that can guide the use of AI in public health to prevent or mitigate potential harms. These actions will support the application of AI to varied public health domains through a framework for more transparent, responsive, and equitable use of this evolving technology, augmenting the work of public health practitioners and researchers to improve health outcomes while minimizing risks and unintended consequences.},

    abstract = {Throughout history, art creation has been regarded as a uniquely human means to express original ideas, emotions, and experiences. However, as Generative Artificial Intelligence reshapes visual, aesthetic, legal, and economic culture, critical questions arise about the moral and aesthetic implications of AI-generated art. Despite the growing use of AI tools in art, the moral impact of AI involvement in the art creation process remains underexplored. Understanding moral judgments of AI-generated art is essential for assessing AI's impact on art and its alignment with ethical norms. Across three pre-registered experiments combining explicit and implicit paradigms with Bayesian modelling, we examined how information about AI systems influences moral and aesthetic judgments and whether human art is implicitly associated with positive attributes compared to AI-generated art. Experiment 1 revealed that factual information about AI backend processes reduced moral acceptability and aesthetic appeal in certain contexts, such as gaining financial incentives and art status. Experiment 2 showed that additional information about AI art's success had no clear impact on moral judgments. Experiment 3 demonstrated that an implicit association task did not reliably link human art with positive attributes and AI art with negative ones. These findings show that factual information about AI systems shapes judgments, while different information doses about AI art's success have limited moral impact. Additionally, implicit associations between human-made and AI-generated art are similar. This work enhances understanding of moral and aesthetic perceptions of AI-generated art, emphasizing the importance of examining human—AI interactions in an arts context, and their current and evolving societal implications.},

    abstract = {Introduction
New modes of assessments are needed to evaluate of the authenticity of student learning in an artificial intelligence (AI) world. In mid-2023, we piloted a new assessment type; a collaborative group multimedia assessment with AI allowance. The aim of the research study was to explore the experiences of students using AI in a multimedia assessment. We further aimed to determine whether these use cases changed student perceptions of the ways AI can be used in learning and assessment.
Methods
Students enrolled in a capstone Pharmacology interdisciplinary unit (n = 40) were included in an exploratory, qualitative case study methodology. Thematic analysis using an AI role-based conceptual framework was used to explore student perceptions of AI use prior to and during their projects from logbooks documenting the assessment process.
Results
AI was initially perceived by students as having a personal tutor-style role, which aligned with the taxonomy with AI acting as an Arbiter (49 %), Oracle (41 %) and Quant (10 %). In contrast to their earlier perceptions, AI was only used in a limited manner in the early stages of assessment in the idea generation in the role as an Oracle (86 %) or in data analytic purposes as a Quant (14 %), (n = 14 cases in 5 groups). No student group used AI to generate written text for the final assessment.
Discussion
Tension between perceived and actual use of AI is indicative of the uncertainty faced by students with the allowance of AI within assessments. Clear guidance for educators and students about how to assess the AI-supported learning process is needed to ensure the integrity of the assessment system.},

This study develops a typology of GenAI-supported work grounded in individual ambidexterity (IA), which highlights employees’ capacity to balance exploration and exploitation while navigating competing demands. Through a thorough review of the literature and empirical examples, we identify four GenAI-enabled work types: Design and Innovation, Data Analysis and Insight Evocation, Customer Service and Engagement, and Content Generation and Optimization. These types reflect the interplay of two critical IA tensions – specialization (generalist vs. specialist) and task routinization (routine vs. non-routine), offering insights into how employees can adapt their skills and roles. Our findings provide actionable recommendations for workforce development, including designing targeted skill-building programs, implementing ethical guidelines, and fostering empowering organizational environments. Additionally, we address the psychological and procedural challenges of integrating GenAI into workplaces and propose strategies to align workforce transformation with policy objectives. By bridging theoretical insights with practical recommendations, this study offers managers a structured roadmap for fostering an ambidextrous and resilient workforce in the age of GenAI.},

Grounded in Allport's (1954) Contact Hypothesis and the Dual Identity Model (DIM; Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000), the study examines whether structured interactions with artificial humans can foster positive intergroup attitudes. Following the framework of E-contact interventions (White & Abu-Rayya, 2012), participants (N = 70 Caucasian university students) will engage in a within-between mixed-design experiment over three days. They will interact daily with an AI-powered 3D digital assistant representing either an outgroup member (Black avatar) or an ingroup member (White avatar) depending on the experimental condition, with pre- and post-intervention measures of intergroup attitudes. The structured interactions will follow the two-phase design of E-contact interventions, initially fostering personal acquaintance, then emphasizing group salience, and finally reinforcing a shared superordinate identity—a process aligned with the principles of DIM to maximize the generalization of positive intergroup attitudes. The virtual assistant will facilitate cooperative activities designed to enhance inclusivity, promote cultural exchange, and maintain subgroup distinctiveness while fostering a common identity. To ensure the effectiveness and coherence of the intervention, the scripted interactions will be pretested through a pilot study before implementation. This research offers a preliminary step toward understanding how artificial intelligence might contribute to enhancing E-contact interventions, potentially providing scalable and structured tools for fostering positive intergroup relations and supporting social integration.},

Echocardiography, which provides detailed evaluations of cardiac structure and pathology, is central to cardiac imaging. Traditionally, the assessment of disease severity, treatment effectiveness, and prognosis prediction relied on detailed parameters obtained by trained sonographers and the expertise of specialists, which can limit access and availability. Recent advancements in deep learning and large-scale computing have enabled the automatic acquisition of parameters in a short time using vast amounts of historical training data. These technologies have been shown to predict the presence of diseases and future cardiovascular events with or without relying on quantitative parameters. Additionally, with the advent of large-scale language models, zero-shot prediction that does not require human labeling and automatic echocardiography report generation are also expected. The field of AI-enhanced echocardiography is poised for further development, with the potential for more widespread use in routine clinical practice. This review discusses the capabilities of deep learning models developed using echocardiography, their limitations, current applications, and research utilizing generative artificial intelligence technologies.},

Credential fraud among healthcare professionals is a global, significant, and ever-evolving challenge. Technological innovations, such as digital imaging and generative artificial intelligence (AI) that make it easier to fabricate documents, have changed the credential evaluation and verification landscape. A global health worker shortage compounds the critical need to maintain integrity, reliability, and rigor in credential verification of healthcare professionals.
Purpose
To identify evidence-based best practices for combatting nursing credential fraud in the context of AI.
Methods
This research effort entailed a scoping review following Arskey and O'Malley's methodological framework to identify scholarly research related to AI and nursing credential fraud. After the scoping review, an environmental scan of grey literature and professional guidance was performed. Integrated analysis of the findings was used to develop themes and recommendations to guide future work.
Results
Four articles, all published between 2020 and 2025, were subjected to full-text review. Of these four articles, none directly addressed AI in perpetrating or combatting nursing credential fraud. The environmental scan revealed practices documented by professional associations and regulatory bodies as well as emerging trends. Five areas of future research are recommended based on these findings: (1) translate existing research, (2) collaborate in cross-functional teams; (3) engage in experimental software development; (4) generate evidence-based guidance; and (5) participate in ongoing evaluation processes.
Conclusions
This study found emerging practices but no empirical research or evidence-based guidance on the use of AI in combatting or perpetuating nursing credential fraud. Literature addressing employment fraud, AI and nursing regulation, and AI in credential evaluation reveal that nursing credential fraud leveraging AI tools requires urgent attention from regulators, credential evaluators, employers, and researchers.},

In cycle-2, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) was additionally integrated into the SIDD processes within the teacher community. The findings in cycle-1 indicated a general lack of interdisciplinary knowledge among the teachers for effective STEAM lesson design.

    abstract = {Chatbots serve as valuable instruments for enhancing students' educational experience and aiding them in their day-to-day academic tasks. Advances in Generative AI (GAI) have ushered in increasingly sophisticated and adaptive chatbots, with ChatGPT and DALL⋅E being prime examples. ChatGPT excels at generating text-based answers across diverse areas of knowledge, while DALL⋅E is adept at converting text-based concepts into visual imagery. These technologies are increasingly used by students across various levels of education. In this study, we introduce AI4Design, a web-based system designed to assist design students with their course projects by acting as an intelligent chatbot. The field of design is propitious for such work because of the increasing use of technology and the necessity of introducing its critical use during study. Comprising two integrated modules, the system is based on a two-step workflow. The first step is anchored on ChatGPT, enabling students to prompt questions and receive answers. The second step allows for the generation of one or more images based on the system's answer to the initial question. Our research assesses whether our system can offer valuable insights and inspiration to students in their design work. We conducted an exploratory study in the Design domain involving 31 students from the Lebanese American University. Over a two- to three-day period, participants used the AI4Design system to enhance their projects. A subsequent evaluation of their work indicated improvements in conceptual clarity and visual outputs that highlighted a measurable increase in creativity, supporting the efficacy of both the system and its foundational learning model, which will be confirmed in the future through a large-scale experimental study. Meanwhile, our study suggests that in the iterative design process, GAI can assist students in making better decisions by giving them just-in-time access to a broader palette of possibilities.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of the economy, air pollution has become increasingly severe. Accurate prediction of the Air Quality Index (AQI) is crucial for safeguarding public health and the environment. However, AQI time series exhibit strong randomness and volatility, posing challenges for traditional forecasting methods to achieve precise AQI predictions. Therefore, we propose a new AQI hybrid prediction model, TG-Hybrid model, which integrates generative artificial intelligence, signal decomposition techniques, artificial intelligence methods, and optimization algorithms. In the proposed model, missing values in the data are handled using generative adversarial networks, effectively addressing the issue of a large number of missing values in time series data. Autoregressive integrated moving average is employed to forecast the linear components of the data, while variational mode decomposition decomposes AQI into multiple modes. Particle swarm optimization is used to combine the prediction results of convolutional neural network combined with bidirectional long short-term memory and extreme gradient boosting. Additionally, AQI prediction experiments were conducted using air pollution data from Tangshan and Beijing, and compared with fifteen other models. The results indicate that the root mean square error for Tangshan and Beijing are 6.407 and 7.485, respectively, significantly outperforming other baseline models.},

    abstract = {Background
A substantial cohort of individuals rely on online resources, such as discussion forums, for support on tapering antidepressants. This study aimed to assess the performance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in responding to clinical queries on tapering antidepressants.
Methods
Ten queries on tapering antidepressants were developed based on previous research, prescribing guidelines, and online peer support forums. Queries covered areas including reasons for discontinuing antidepressants, tapering methods, withdrawal symptoms, and relapse. Each query was submitted to ChatGPT (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA) using the GPT-4 model as an independent standalone query using standardised prompts. Responses were evaluated in terms of relevance, accuracy, completeness, and clarity by two researchers working independently.
Results
GPT-4 responses to all tapering queries were considered relevant and within scope. Most responses (8/10) incorporated safety netting by emphasising the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before making any medication changes. The overall accuracy, completeness, and clarity of responses compared less favourably. The response to a query on hyperbolic tapering had the least favourable assessment. This was due to inaccuracies as the response incorrectly referred to logarithmic reductions and provided inaccurate examples of fixed dosage reductions. Several instances of AI hallucinations were identified, including fabricated references.
Conclusion
Generative AI is having a transformative impact on healthcare, including how healthcare professionals and patients access information about clinical queries, such as antidepressant tapering. The study findings show that GPT-4 was able to provide relevant and safety-conscious responses on antidepressant tapering. However, performance issues such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies in tapering recommendations highlight the important role that healthcare professionals continue to play in providing patients with clinically trained, professional support in safely managing health-related issues. Further research on developing AI evaluation tools is needed to ensure consistency in the approaches used in evaluating the performance of AI in addressing clinical queries.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are an online source of information consulted by adolescents to gain insight into mental health and wellness behaviors. However, the accuracy and content of generative AI responses to questions related to suicide have not been systematically investigated.
Objective
This study aims to investigate general (not counseling-specific) generative AI chatbots’ responses to questions regarding suicide.
Methods
A content analysis was conducted of the responses of generative AI chatbots to questions about suicide. In phase 1 of the study, generative chatbots examined include: (1) Google Bard or Gemini; (2) Microsoft Bing or CoPilot; (3) ChatGPT 3.5 (OpenAI); and (4) Claude (Anthropic). In phase 2 of the study, additional generative chatbot responses were analyzed, which included Google Gemini, Claude 2 (Anthropic), xAI Grok 2, Mistral AI, and Meta AI (Meta Platforms). The two phases occurred a year apart.
Results
Findings included a linguistic analysis of the authenticity and tone within the responses using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program. There was an increase in the depth and accuracy of the responses between phase 1 and phase 2 of the study. There is evidence that the responses by the generative AI chatbots were more comprehensive and responsive during phase 2 than phase 1. Specifically, the responses were found to provide more information regarding all aspects of suicide (eg, signs of suicide, lethality, resources, and ways to support those in crisis). Another difference noted in the responses between the first and second phases was the emphasis on the 988 suicide hotline number.
Conclusions
While this dynamic information may be helpful for youth in need, the importance of individuals seeking help from a trained mental health professional remains. Further, generative AI algorithms related to suicide questions should be checked periodically to ensure best practices regarding suicide prevention are being communicated.},

Bioinspired composite materials offer several advantages by mimicking the structure of natural counterparts. However, their complex hierarchical structure, compared to the limited number of observations, makes it difficult to extract all the structural features and vary the structure to optimize the materials’ functions without losing their natural features. We applied generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to design composites inspired by animal skin patterns, leveraging a small dataset to generate diverse configurations that closely emulate natural designs. Our computational simulations investigated the structure-mechanics relationship in these materials, revealing significant variations in mechanical functions and identifying patterns that exhibited superior mechanical properties. We validated these outstanding configurations’ performance through tensile tests on specimens produced by a multimaterial printer. We showcase GenAI’s role in structural augmentation that can yield rational bioinspired designs, complemented by an educational web page with interactive games for public access.},

The literature search was carried out using the SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases. GAI holds immense potential for revolutionizing agriculture, offering solutions ranging from precision farming to pest management and supply chain optimization. Though some applications can extend beyond efficiency gains, and hallucinations occurrence i.e. false output information presented as fact, remains an open issue, GAI can be decisive for tasks like improving training datasets, refining models, and facilitating time series analysis. This review extensively describes the vital importance of these tasks for agriculture, precision and animal farming, caused by the rise of new technologies. As a result, by embracing and responsibly implementing GAI applications, it is possible to create a more sustainable and resilient future for agriculture and precision farming. GAI have the capacity to extract specific information from big data systems, offering huge potential to meet a growing global population demand and consequent environmental challenges for the future.},

    abstract = {With the rapid development of renewable energy and electric vehicles, batteries, as the core components of electrochemical energy storage systems, have become a global focus in both scientific research and industrial sectors due to their critical impact on system efficiency and safety. However, the complex multi-physics reactions within batteries make traditional mathematical models inadequate for comprehensively revealing their mechanisms. The key to solving this problem lies in introducing data-driven approaches, which have laid a solid foundation for battery research and development through extensive accumulation of experimental data and extraction of effective information. Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), leveraging its powerful latent pattern learning and data generation capabilities, has already found widespread applications in protein structure prediction, material inverse design, and data augmentation, demonstrating its broad application prospects. Applying GAI to battery research workflows with diverse battery data resources could provide innovative solutions to challenges in battery research. In this perspective, we introduce the core principles and latest advancements of generative models (GMs), including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and Diffusion Model (DM), which can learn the latent distribution of the input samples to generate new data by sampling from it. Applications of GAI in battery research are then reviewed. For battery materials design, by learning material compositions, structures, and properties, GM can generate novel candidate materials with desired properties through conditional constraints, significantly extending the chemical space to be explored. For electrode microstructure characterization, GM can serve as a bridge for interconversion and integration of different image data, enhance the quality of microscopic characterization, and generate realistic synthetic data. For battery state estimation, GM can perform data augmentation and feature extraction on battery datasets, which benefits the model performance for battery state estimation. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future development directions in terms of data governance and model design, including data quality and diversity, data standardization and sharing, usability of synthetic data, interpretability of GM, and foundational models for battery research. For the innovation and advancement of battery technology, this perspective offers theoretical references and practical guidelines for implementing GAI as an effective tool in battery research workflows by discussing its status and prospects in this field.},

    abstract = {Background and Aims
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that can lead to a physical, social, and economic burden. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, gained attention for its potential to support medical practice. However, concerns remain about the reliability and consistency of its responses. This study systematically reviews the existing evidence on the role of generative AI in IBD.
Materials and methods
We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Studies investigating generative AI in IBD care were identified through PubMed and Embase (Jan 2020–Sep 2024).
Results
From 2875 records, 8 studies (2023–2024) met inclusion criteria: 5 on patient education, 2 on decision support, and 1 on research ideation. For patient education, ChatGPT provided clear and accurate responses, with accuracy reaching 84.2 % in a study, though sometimes lacked consistency. In decision support, ChatGPT’s classifications of ulcerative colitis severity aligned with clinician assessments in 80 % of cases and in 87.8 % of cases for guideline-based dysplasia management. For research ideation, ChatGPT generated highly relevant (mean score: 4.9 ± 0.26) and clear (4.8 ± 0.41) questions, but lacked specificity (2.86/5) and originality (1.07/5).
Conclusions
Generative AI shows promise in IBD care, but concerns about accuracy, consistency, and outdated information highlight the need for expert oversight before clinical integration.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This study aims to critically evaluate the applicability of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools for academic research in international business (IB), specifically focusing on the topic of firms’ nonlinear internationalization. It assesses these tools’ key performance dimensions: correctness, hallucinations and thoroughness.
Design/methodology/approach
This research adopts an exploratory approach, examining a comprehensive set of GenAI tools: eight chatbots and four AI-driven applications designed for academic purposes. The evaluation focuses on the capabilities and limitations of these tools in generating accurate research-related content for IB scholars.
Findings
This study finds that while GenAI tools capture some aspects of nonlinear internationalization, they often produce partially accurate and/or biased results. Common issues include providing fictitious sources, incorrect publication data and vague or incorrect answers. Thus, substantial development is still needed for GenAI tools to become reliable for scientific research.
Practical implications
Researchers should use GenAI tools with caution, verifying the accuracy of generated content and citations independently. A cautious approach is crucial to maintain the integrity and quality of academic research.
Social implications
This study raises awareness about ethical and practical challenges of using AI in academia, including issues related to plagiarism and misinformation. It underscores the importance of critical evaluation when using GenAI tools for research.
Originality/value
This paper contributes to the emerging literature on the role of GenAI in academic research by providing a critical assessment of the usability and limitations of current tools in studying complex IB phenomena. By using nonlinear internationalization as an example, it demonstrates how GenAI may support or hinder IB scholarship.},

    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to permeate every facet of infectious disease practice—from prevention and public health surveillance to epidemic management and bedside care. Routine care data (laboratory results, medication orders, progress notes) and research-generated datasets now fuel state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) pipelines that sharpen diagnosis, prognosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and, by combining both sources, accelerate drug discovery. In diagnostics, deep networks that now flag pneumonia or tuberculosis on chest images are increasingly able to identify—and localize—virtually more infectious processes throughout the body, while simultaneously predicting pathogen identity and antimicrobial resistance from routine microbiology. Prognostic models trained on Electronic Health Records surpass traditional scores in anticipating clinical deterioration or postoperative sepsis, enabling earlier targeted interventions. Predictive analytics can also personalize antimicrobial dosing by fusing real-time drug-monitoring data. Large language models (LLMs) build upon these advances by transforming unstructured clinical narratives into structured phenotypes suitable for predictive modeling, automatically summarizing patient encounters, generating synthetic cohorts for rare conditions, and providing real-time conversational decision support at the patient’s bedside. Despite rapid progress, real-world deployment faces hurdles: high computational and licensing costs, vendor-specific implementation constraints, limited cross-site model transferability, and fragmented governance of safety, bias, and cybersecurity risks. Rigorous, lifecycle-based evaluation frameworks—covering external validation, cost-effectiveness analysis, and post-deployment monitoring—are required to ensure safe, equitable, and sustainable AI adoption. This review synthesizes current applications, evidential strengths, and unresolved challenges, and proposes a translational roadmap aligning technical innovation with clinical and regulatory realities.},

    abstract = {Sustainable product innovation (SPI) is increasingly central to New Product Development (NPD) teams, aligning with global sustainability goals and industry expectations. However, the factors associated with SPI at team level remain underexplored. This study examines the roles of team skill differentiation and team adaptability in fostering SPI, proposing that these factors support teams in the pursuit of sustainability-oriented innovation more effectively. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in shaping the strength of these relationships. Drawing on the double diamond framework and its AI-augmented adaptation, we hypothesize that skill differentiation expands the range of potential solutions in the divergent phase of innovation, while adaptability enhances responsiveness in the convergent phase. GenAI is posited to enhance these effects by augmenting knowledge recombination and real-time strategic adaptation. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a multi-industry survey of NPD teams engaged in sustainability initiatives, applying multiple regression analysis to assess the proposed relationships. All our hypotheses were empirically supported. Overall, this study contributes to SPI research by integrating team capability theory with AI-driven innovation frameworks. The findings highlight the need for firms to cultivate multidisciplinary teams with adaptive capacities while leveraging GenAI as an amplifier rather than a substitute for human expertise. The results also underscore that effective SPI requires both internal knowledge diversity and external responsiveness, alongside AI tools that enhance creativity and sustainability-driven decision-making. Finally, this research provides insights into how NPD teams can enhance their engagement in sustainable innovation, aligning with the broader objectives of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9 and 12.},

@article{BENTZEN2025103798,
    abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) will impact a large proportion of jobs in the short to medium term, especially in the developed countries. The consequences will be felt across many sectors including health care, a critical sector for implementation of AI tools because glitches in algorithms or biases in training datasets may lead to suboptimal treatment that may negatively affect the health of an individual. The stakes are obviously higher in case of potentially life-threatening diseases such as cancer and therapies with a potential for causing severe or even fatal adverse events. Over the last two decades, much of the research on AI in health care has focussed on diagnostic radiology and digital pathology, but a solid body of research is emerging on AI tools in the radiation oncology workflow. Many of these applications are relatively uncontroversial, although there is still a lack of evidence regarding effectiveness rather than efficiency, and—the ultimate bar—evidence of clinical utility. Proponents of AI will argue that these algorithms should be implemented with robust human supervision. One challenge here is the deskilling effect associated with new technologies. We will become increasingly dependent on the AI tools over time, and we will become less capable of assessing the quality of the AI output. Much of this research appears almost old-fashioned in view of the rapid advances in Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). GenAI can draw from multiple types of data and produce output that is personalised and appears relevant in the given context. Especially the rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened a wide field of potential applications that were out of bounds just a few years ago. One LLM, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), has been made widely accessible to end-users as ChatGPT-4, which passed a rigorous Turing test in a recent study. In this viewpoint, I argue for the necessity of independent academic research to establish evidence-based applications of AI in medicine. Algorithmic medicine is an intervention similar to a new drug or a new medical device. We should be especially concerned about under-represented minorities and rare/atypical clinical cases that may drown in the petabyte-sized training sets. A huge educational push is needed to ensure that the end-users of AI in health care understand the strengths and weaknesses of algorithmic medicine. Finally, we need to address the ethical boundaries for where and when GenAI can replace humans in the relation between patients and healthcare providers.},

Personal statements (PSs) express applicants’ personal characteristics and motivations informing pursuit of a surgical career. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary technology. There are currently no data to suggest how and to what extent AI is used in surgical residency applications. We examined the prevalence of AI use and applicant pool characteristics in PSs submitted to a surgical residency.
Design
PSs from US MD and DO applicants to an academic general surgery program were collected for both the 2022-23 and 2023-24 NRMP Match cycles. PSs were analyzed using 2 AI-detection tools: GPTZero and Copyleaks. Data were analyzed using T-test and Fisher’s Exact Test.
Setting
UMass Chan Medical School—Baystate general surgery residency program in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Participants
There were 1332 applications during 2022-23 NRMP Match cycle and 1221 for 2023-24. After excluding international medical graduates and incomplete applications, 1490 PSs were analyzed.
Results
1490 PS were included (758 [50.9%] for 2022-23; 732 [49.1%] for 2023-24). Demographic characteristics did not differ between the 2 cycles. GPTZero identified AI use in 77 (10.2%) PSs in 2022-23 and 268 (36.6%) in 2023-24 (p < 0.001). Copyleaks identified AI use in 20 (2.6%) PSs in 2022-23 and 165 (22.5%) in 2023-24 (p < 0.001). Concordance in AI detection with both tools was observed in 13 (1.7% of total PSs) for 2022-23 and 155 (21.2%) for 2023-24 (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of concordance in 2023-24 showed increased non-English native language characteristics (38.7% vs 19.6%; p < 0.001), a lower average personal statement word count (597.3 vs 645.9; p < 0.001) and shorter average sentence (10.0 vs 10.4 words; p < 0.001) in the AI group.
Conclusions
Although AI-detection tools are imperfect, demonstration of increased AI use in personal statement preparation is compelling. Implications of AI use in residency applications are unknown, and programs must develop policies anticipating ongoing and potentially increased use of AI in the upcoming application cycles.},

    abstract = {Background
Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory disease requiring ongoing patient education and individualized management. The increasing reliance on digital tools, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI), to answer health-related questions has raised concerns about the accuracy, reliability, and comprehensibility of AI-generated information for people living with asthma.
Objective
To evaluate systematically the reliability, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and understandability of responses generated by three widely used artificial intelligence–based chatbots (ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot) to common questions formulated by people with asthma.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 15 questions regarding asthma management were formulated by patients and categorized by difficulty. Responses from ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot were evaluated by international experts for accuracy and comprehensiveness, and by patient representatives for understandability. Reliability was assessed through consistency testing across devices. We conducted a blinded evaluation.
Results
A total of 21 experts and 16 patient representatives participated in the evaluation. ChatGPT demonstrated the highest reliability (15 of 15 responses), accuracy (median score, 9.0; interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-9.0), and comprehensiveness (median score, 8.0; IQR, 8.0-9.0) compared with Bard and Copilot (P < .0001). Bard achieved superior scores in understandability (median score, 9.0; IQR, 8.0-10.0; P < .0001). Performance differences were consistent across question difficulty levels.
Conclusions
Artificial intelligence–driven chatbots can provide generally accurate and understandable responses to asthma-related questions. Variability in reliability and accuracy underscores the need for caution in clinical contexts. Artificial intelligence tools may complement but cannot replace professional medical advice in asthma management.},

    abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools are widely used by learners and this trend is poised to continue. However, little is known about whether and how GenAI use impacts learning and performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of GenAI on performance by examining a key affordance of GenAI—seeking help via question asking. We compared the questions that learners asked GenAI versus a human tutor online during a writing task. Using quantitative ethnographic methods, we found that: (a) participants in the GenAI condition asked significantly more questions compared to those in the Tutor condition; (b) GenAI participants tended to ask one-off questions, while Tutor participants tended to have longer conversational exchanges; (c) GenAI participants tended to question pragmatically, asking direct questions about conceptual and procedural knowledge, while Tutor participants tended to make indirect request for feedback; (d) question asking, as measured by epistemic network analysis, mediated the relationship between experimental condition and performance—the more pragmatic the questions, and thus the more like questions in the GenAI condition, the better the performance; and (e) questions in the GenAI condition were driven by social coordination and knowledge deficits, while questions in the Tutor condition were driven by social coordination and establishing common ground. These findings suggest learners may be less hesitant to admit knowledge deficits and more willing to repair them when interacting with GenAI compared to human tutors.

    abstract = {The integration of chatbots into psychiatry introduces a novel approach to support clinical decision-making, but biases in their recommendations pose significant concerns. This study investigates potential biases in chatbot-generated recommendations for adjunctive therapy in difficult-to-treat depression, comparing these outputs with the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) 2023 guidelines. The analysis involved calculating Cohen’s kappa coefficients to measure the overall level of agreement between chatbot-generated classifications and CANMAT guidelines. Differences between chatbot-generated and CANMAT classifications for each medication were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results reveal substantial agreement for high-performing models, such as Google AI's Gemini 2.0 Flash, which achieved the highest Cohen’s kappa value of 0.82 (SE = 0.052). In contrast, OpenAI’s o1 model showed a lower agreement of 0.746 (SE = 0.057). Notable discrepancies were observed in the overestimation of medications such as quetiapine and lithium and the underestimation of modafinil and ketamine. Additionally, a distinct bias pattern was observed in OpenAI’s chatbots, which demonstrated a tendency to over-recommend lithium and bupropion. Our study highlights both the promise and the challenges of employing AI tools in psychiatric practice, and advocates for multi-model approaches to mitigate bias and improve clinical reliability.},

These factors explain 49.3% of the intention to use GenAI tools, 58.7% of the intention to adopt them, and 39.6% of the intention to recommend them. However, other factors had no significant effect on behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature on technology acceptance by extending the UTAUT 3 model to an educational context.

    abstract = {Research Question
How reliable are generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in responding to patient-relevant questions about preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), as evaluated by reproductive medicine specialists?
Design
A prospective evaluation was conducted comparing three publicly available generative AI models—ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini-1.5, and Llama-2. Twelve reproductive medicine specialists from different clinics assessed chatbot-generated responses to 13 PGT-related questions, divided into simple and controversial categories. Each response was scored from 0 to 5 using predefined criteria. Assuming all answers were excellent, the maximum score was 25 points for simple questions and 40 points for controversial ones.
Results
A total of 156 evaluations were completed. Among simple questions, the lowest-rated response was to “What are the types and techniques used for PGT?” (mean score: 2.83±0.94). For controversial questions, “What is the percentage of aneuploidy that allows an embryo to be defined as mosaic?” scored lowest (2.67±1.22). ChatGPT performed best across both categories (simple: 16.83±1.80; controversial: 27.75±4.49), followed by Gemini (14.92±2.02; 26.08±3.99) and Llama (13.58±3.60; 16.92±4.96). Statistically significant differences were observed, particularly between ChatGPT and Llama (p=0.027 for simple, p<0.001 for controversial), and between Gemini and Llama for controversial questions (p<0.001). No significant performance differences were noted across participating specialists.
Conclusions
Generative AI shows moderate reliability in addressing PGT-related inquiries, with ChatGPT and Gemini outperforming Llama. While performance was higher for simple than for controversial questions, the variability underscores the need for clinical oversight. Further refinement and validation are essential before widespread integration of AI tools in reproductive medicine.},

    abstract = {In telecommunication technology, identifying standard-essential patents (SEPs) plays a crucial role in the management of intellectual property. This technology is regulated by technical standards that are largely based on the content of SEPs. These patents are declared standard-essential by their owners because they contain elements of a technical standard. The declaration process leaves room for over- and under-declaration, which entails risks for organizations. This paper focuses on the question of how generative artificial intelligence can be used to assess the standard-essentiality of 5G technology patents. For this purpose, the standard-essentiality is assessed using different prompts with four Large Language Models (LLMs) in two variants. In the first variant, the LLM results are generated by a rather simple prompt and compared with an approach based on unsupervised and supervised machine learning. The result shows that large LLMs are capable of assessing the standard-essentiality. In the second variant, the best-performing LLM is selected and the prompt is expanded to include selected parts of a technical standard. While the assessment results remain largely the same, the LLM is now able to explain in which detail a patent is part of a standard. This has several implications for patent evaluation, licensing and litigation strategies.},

These findings were compared with responses from a sample of Australian and Chinese trainee teachers, comprising individuals nearing qualification with varied demographic and educational backgrounds. Eight vignettes depicting students with varying abilities and efforts were evaluated by the LLMs ten times each, resulting in 320 evaluations, with trainee teachers providing comparable ratings. For LD students, the LLMs exhibited lower frustration and higher sympathy than trainee teachers, while for non-LD students, LLMs similarly showed lower frustration, with ChatGPT3.5 aligning closely with Chinese teachers and ChatGPT4 demonstrating more sympathy than both teacher groups. Notably, LLMs expressed lower expectations of future academic failure for both LD and non-LD students compared to trainee teachers. Regarding feedback, the findings reflect ratings of the qualitative nature of feedback LLMs and teachers would provide, rather than actual feedback text. The LLMs, particularly ChatGPT3.5 and Gemini, were rated as providing more negative feedback than trainee teachers, while ChatGPT4 provided more positive ratings for both LD and non-LD students, aligning with Chinese teachers in some cases. These findings suggest that LLMs may promote a positive and inclusive outlook for LD students by exhibiting lower judgmental tendencies and higher optimism. However, their tendency to rate feedback more negatively than trainee teachers highlights the need to recalibrate AI tools to better align with cultural and emotional nuances.},

    abstract = {Owing to the ability to fuse non-Euclidean node-edge information, Graph Learning (GL) is pervasively leveraged across applications including web recommendation, community detection, and molecular classification. Current GL paradigms extremely emphasize absolute fairness and impartiality for all clients. This limits its flexibility and adaptability in addressing specific circumstances that demand customizable model queries (e.g., access control and intellectual property protection), where authorizable GL models present non-trivial obstacles in realization. Inspired by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), to overcome this limitation, we propose Auth-Graph, the first authorizable GL methodology via a built-in-model access control mechanism. Specifically, our Auth-Graph employs a generative perturbating-driven backdoor to reach authorizable access. The activation of the backdoor is exclusively confined to rightly masked and perturbed inputs, which yield accurate results, whereas all other inputs induce the GL model to produce erroneous outcomes. Moreover, to strengthen compatibility and support multi-user functionality, the masking mechanism operates correctly with a generative masker solely for authorized users possessing valid tokens, with each user’s token being uniquely distinct. Empirical results across benchmark GL models and datasets substantiate that Auth-Graph robustly prevents unauthorized access (average accuracy 3.68%) while promoting legitimate users to attain standard outputs (average accuracy drop 3.45%).},

In this study, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence to ease the burden of screening and organising papers. Our findings suggest that AI excels in some tasks, particularly when those tasks involve explicitly stated information, and struggles in others, particularly when information is more implicit. A comparison of generative artificial intelligence for filtering papers with ASReview, a popular non-generative tool, reveals trade-offs, with Generative AI being replicable and more efficient, but with concerns about accuracy. We conclude that generative artificial intelligence can be a useful tool for systematic review but requires rigorous validation before use.

This approach has achieved impressive results and has contributed significantly to the progress of AI, particularly in the sphere of supervised deep learning. It has also simplified the design of machine learning systems as the learning process is highly automated. However, not all data processing tasks in conventional deep learning pipelines have been automated. In most cases data has to be manually collected, preprocessed and further extended through data augmentation before they can be effective for training. Recently, special techniques for automating these tasks have emerged. The automation of data processing tasks is driven by the need to utilize large volumes of complex, heterogeneous data for machine learning and big data applications. Today, end-to-end automated data processing systems based on automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques are capable of taking raw data and transforming them into useful features for big data tasks by automating all intermediate processing stages. In this work, we present a thorough review of approaches for automating data processing tasks in deep learning pipelines, including automated data preprocessing – e.g., data cleaning, labeling, missing data imputation, and categorical data encoding – as well as data augmentation (including synthetic data generation using generative AI methods) and feature engineering – specifically, automated feature extraction, feature construction and feature selection. In addition to automating specific data processing tasks, we discuss the use of AutoML methods and tools to simultaneously optimize all stages of the machine learning pipeline.},

    abstract = {Given the constantly increasing number of newly published vulnerabilities, manually assessing their scores (e.g., under the Common Vulnerability Scoring System) has become unfeasible. Recently, learning-based systems have been proposed to automatically predict vulnerability scores. Such systems use vulnerability indexing databases to train deep learning algorithms. However, their practical applicability has important limitations, including a high dependency on the quality and diversity of training data, and high computational requirements. In addition, vulnerability descriptions often do not follow the standard templates and are not rich enough with respect to the expected features. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that takes advantage of both generative artificial intelligence and lightweight deep learning techniques to provide an efficient and effective solution for automated vulnerability scoring. Data extracted from the National Vulnerability Dataset is fed into a large language model layer, whose output (i.e., an augmented dataset) is then used in a lightweight fine-tuned BERTsmall layer. We provide the results of an extensive experimental assessment of the effect of both each layer of the architecture and end-to-end performances. The results suggest that the combination of GPT3.5-Turbo and BERTsmall provides the most effective accuracy-time trade-off. We also compare the performance of the proposed architecture with other LLMs, BERT models, and cutting-edge approaches. The results show good improvements in prediction quality also when compared to a recent technique that incorporates data from 66 different sources, including the NVD.},

Teachers and students have been increasingly using chatbots in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in various ways, including for assessment purposes. However, there has been a lack of systematic investigation into LLMs’ capabilities and limitations in automatically generating items for STEM subject assessments, especially given that LLMs can hallucinate and may risk promoting misconceptions and hindering conceptual understanding. To address this, we systematically investigated LLMs' conceptual understanding and quality of working in generating question and answer pairs across various STEM subjects. We used prompt engineering on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with three different approaches: standard prompting, standard prompting with added chain-of-thought prompting using worked examples with steps, and the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language. The questions and answer pairs were generated at the pre-university level in the three STEM subjects of chemistry, physics, and mathematics and evaluated by subject-matter experts. We found that LLMs generated quality questions when using the chain-of-thought prompting for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and when using the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 overall. However, there were varying patterns in generating multistep answers, with differences in final answer and intermediate step accuracy. An interesting finding was that the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 significantly outperformed the other approaches in generating correct final answers while demonstrating moderate accuracy in generating multistep answers correctly. In addition, through qualitative analysis, we identified domain-specific prompting patterns across the three STEM subjects. We then discussed how our findings aligned with, contradicted, and contributed to the current body of knowledge on automatic item generation research using LLMs, and the implications for teachers using LLMs to generate STEM assessment items.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology in healthcare education with potential to enhance simulation by addressing logistical barriers and by providing increased access to diverse settings in healthcare education, leading to improved learning outcomes. This rapid scoping review explores the use of generative AI in simulation-based education.
Methods
Searches were conducted in CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science using terms such as “generative artificial intelligence” and “healthcare simulation.” The review followed the World Health Organization (WHO) Rapid Review Guide and was structured using Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework for scoping reviews.
Results
After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were included. Five themes emerged: (1) removal of logistical barriers, (2) authentic practice, (3) distinctive value, (4) limitations of generative AI, and (5) potential with human oversight. Generative AI improves access to simulation by creating cost-effective, scalable, and realistic scenarios while fostering critical thinking through reflective learning. However, challenges such as misinformation and ethical concerns remain.
Conclusions
This scoping review identified growing momentum around generative AI's role in healthcare simulation. While early studies highlight its potential to support scalable, adaptive, and authentic training experiences, effective integration requires strong governance, ethical safeguards, and human oversight.},

Teachers, in particular, face increasing demands to respond to AI-driven transformations in learning environments yet lack structured guidance on which competencies matter. This paper presents the AIware Competency Model, a comprehensive framework of 98 AI-related competencies designed for K–12 education, including emerging aspects of GAI. The model was developed using an Action Design Research (ADR) approach, structured across four iterative stages: (1) a systematic literature review and analysis of 14 existing AI competency models to identify conceptual gaps; (2) semi-structured interviews with AI experts and educators (n = 5) to inform initial model development; (3) three rounds of focus groups involving teachers, policymakers, and AI professionals (total n = 46) to refine and evaluate the competencies; and (4) a competency ranking process (n = 10) to assess perceived importance across educational roles. The AIware Competency Model addresses current fragmentation in AI education research by offering a unified, empirically grounded framework aligned with practical classroom needs. It enables mapping to existing curriculum standards and supports both teacher preparation and student readiness in a world increasingly shaped by AI. The model contributes to the field by combining theoretical synthesis with practitioner input, offering a robust foundation for future research, curriculum design, and policy development.},

This study employed dual-system theory to examine the cognitive-behavioral mechanisms underpinning addictive ChatGPT use, positioning self-construal as a key antecedent and cognitive miserliness as a critical consequence. We adopted a mixed-methods approach for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis. Three cross-sectional surveys revealed that heightened activity in the impulsive cognitive system was a significant predictor of addictive ChatGPT use. Moreover, a dysregulation between the impulsive and reflective cognitive systems exacerbated compulsive tendencies and facilitated cognitive miserliness. Self-construal also affected these effects: individuals with an independent orientation were more likely to rely on the impulsive cognitive system, while those with an interdependent orientation engaged the reflective cognitive system more frequently. Notably, the reflective cognitive system often failed to adequately inhibit addictive ChatGPT use. Qualitative insights supported these findings and offered a deeper understanding of users’ behavioral patterns. This study contributes to theoretical discourse on the adverse cognitive impact of GenAI use, and informs managers seeking to design interventions that promote healthier digital engagement.},

However, little attention has been directed to teachers' use of such tools and their implications for the development of GenAI literacies as diverse, historically, and culturally variable practices involving AI tools, especially pre-service teachers (PSTs) in the second language (L2) context. Based on an exploratory multiple-case study of five undergraduate PSTs in Hong Kong, this paper adopts the model of L2 investment (Darvin & Norton, 2015) to address this need by posing three question: 1. What are the GenAI literacies that PSTs invest in as they learn to teach? 2. What are the perceived affordances and constraints of GenAI tools in their learning-to-teach practices? 3. To what extent do their identity and access to resources shape these literacies? Data was collected from a survey, interviews, and observations of participants' GenAI use, and triangulated using content analysis. Findings reveal how PSTs invest in their English and pedagogy learner, bilingual writer, and teacher identities that intertwine with their identities as users of various GenAI tools in GenAI-empowered spaces as ideological sites that shaped PSTs' dispositions and positioning. Recognizing how PSTs deploy multiple resources to invest in contrasting GenAI literacies, this study underscores the need for the language classroom to integrate GenAI literacies instruction that enables a critical awareness of how GenAI tools operate.},

Results reveal precision of 0.045 mm and a 34% cost saving comparing with other commercial solutions. Our findings also show that each artwork, derived from the same digital file, acquires a unique expression, which leads to a redefinition of authenticity in digital art and provides a renewed perspective on the interplay between technology, artistic creation and cultural perception.

A scenario-based experimental design was employed, presenting participants with hypothetical situations of restaurants utilizing AI-generated and human-created social media content. MANOVA results revealed that perceived brand authenticity, image, and self-brand congruity were significantly lower in the GenAI condition compared to the human-generated content condition. Multigroup analysis further indicated that while brand authenticity and image had diminished effects on consumer behavior under the GenAI condition, self-brand congruity played a significantly stronger role in driving e-WOM and behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that AI-generated content may weaken traditional brand perception cues, prompting consumers to rely more on internal identity alignment. The study contributes to S–O–R theory by demonstrating how content source (AI vs. human) moderates the pathways from brand perception to behavior and provides actionable guidance for hospitality marketers seeking to balance GenAI integration with consumer expectations for authenticity and personal resonance.},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid IoT architecture based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AIoT) for the intelligent monitoring and control of beehives, designed with processing capabilities both at the edge and in the cloud, thus adapting to environments with or without internet connectivity. Through an IoT sensor network, the system collects critical data on environmental parameters and hive conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and hive weight, processing them locally at the edge or centrally in the cloud. The architecture incorporates a recommendation system that uses a small language model (SLM) to generate real-time alerts based on data provided by the IoT sensors. This system implements two distinct SLM models, Phi-3.5 and Tinyllama, enabling hardware performance measurement and optimizing efficiency for edge processing. To establish optimal environmental ranges, the recommendation system uses bio-inspired algorithms, such as ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and bee swarm algorithms. Additionally, LSTM neural networks are included to predict honey production and plan hive placement based on climate and weight projections, allowing for precise and personalized adjustments. This dual processing capability (edge and cloud) reduces the need for human intervention, optimizes hive inspection times, and minimizes false positives in monitoring, making it especially beneficial for large-scale beekeeping, where weekly inspection times can exceed 50 h. With this architecture, inspection time is reduced by 80%, significantly improving efficiency in hive management and promoting sustainable practices for bee conservation through intelligent agriculture.},

Through a 16-week intervention structured into three progressive phases, 16 students engaged with multiple GenAI tools while developing competencies in research and academic writing. The data collection included structured GenAI dialogues, periodic questionnaires, reflective assignments, and in-depth interviews. The findings revealed three interconnected dimensions of GenAI literacy development. Students internalized and recreated GenAI knowledge through practice, developed sophisticated prompt engineering skills grounded in metacognitive abilities including a critical awareness of their own values and learning goals, and evolved from viewing GenAI as a mere tool to seeing it as a context-sensitive partner requiring both exploration and caution. Notably, students learned to craft personalized GenAI workflows, critically evaluate GenAI outputs, and establish ethical boundaries that preserved their intellectual growth. This study extends the current GenAI literacy frameworks by empirically demonstrating how knowledge, skills, and attitudes coevolve through sustained engagement. This suggests that effective GenAI literacy education requires iterative practice, metacognitive development, and exposure to diverse tools to ensure that GenAI serves as a catalyst for creativity while maintaining human agency in learning.},

While the first AI-powered negotiation solutions are currently being used by procurement professionals to negotiate for non-critical spend items, which is an example of structural influence, the behavioral influence of AI-based chatbots (i.e., on negotiation approach) remains unknown. It is unclear in which behavioral settings these chatbots deliver value to the buying firm in terms of economic, psychological, and relational outcomes. To fill this gap, we conduct three experiments in buyer–supplier negotiation settings, two in a lab-setting with undergraduate business students and one online experiment with professional negotiators. In our interactive simulations, participants play the role of the supplier, while a ChatGPT-based custom-trained chatbot acts as the buyer. We find that when the chatbot deploys a competitive, as compared to a collaborative, negotiation approach, it will achieve a higher price discount, better payment terms, and a quicker negotiation. However, suppliers trust a collaboratively prompted, as compared to a competitively prompted, chatbot more and demonstrate higher outcome satisfaction, as well as a stronger desire for future interaction. A text analysis of the chat interactions indicates a higher level of similarity when a competitively prompted chatbot is employed, which implies that suppliers also use more insistent and intimidating language, thereby matching the chatbot's negotiation approach to a greater degree. While the negotiation approach is a significant influencing factor, we do not find significant evidence that item type, in our case non-critical or bottleneck, matters, which indicates that AI-based chatbots can be effective in various buyer–supplier settings.},

However, the perceived lack of clarity on the adoption benefits has increased decision-maker’s hesitation to adopt and utilize blockchain technology in the logistics industry. To fully understand blockchain applications in the context of logistics, this paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) on blockchain research in logistics. A selection of 113 articles undergoes review based on a two-axis framework. The first axis lists the core blockchain technologies, such as decentralized ledger, consensus mechanism, and smart contract. It comprehensively reviews their interplay with the foundational logistics requirements, such as agility, collaboration, and resilience. The second axis reviews domains such as e-commerce logistics, business logistics, green logistics, and logistics financing, which are key avenues for blockchain applications. The key themes arising from the review are a precursor to deriving avenues for future research. Finally, we present Web 4.0 in logistics, the new wave of generative artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered blockchain innovation that can shape future logistics. More specifically, we explore the role of modern AI agents in driving future research for seamless blockchain integration to logistics, enabling logistics ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and organizational adoption. Besides addressing a gap in existing literature, the concepts discussed in this study allow for a comprehensive understanding of blockchain adoption in logistics, thus encouraging wider practical application of novel technology. From a theoretical lens, this study helps comprehend blockchain technology and its significance to logistics research.},

In the field of life sciences, GenAI is emerging as a catalyst, accelerating drug discovery by swiftly generating and predicting novel molecules. This expedites the identification of potential drug candidates, significantly reducing time and costs compared to traditional methods. Beyond drug discovery, GenAI contributes to protein folding predictions, genomics research, disease diagnosis and biomarker identification, enhancing our understanding of diseases and health conditions, fostering the development of personalized medicine. In agribusiness, GenAI proves instrumental in optimizing crop breeding and improving agricultural productivity. It can generate new crop varieties with desired traits by analyzing vast datasets comprising genomic and ecological information, addressing challenges such as disease resistance, improved yield, and enhanced nutritional content. Moreover, GenAI transcends traditional applications and extends its influence on synthetic biology, contributing to the design of novel enzymes and pathways. This opens avenues for bio-based manufacturing, renewable energy production, and environmental remediation. By harnessing the power of GenAI, the synergies between biosciences and technology accelerate innovation, improve efficiency, decrease costs, and address critical challenges. Conversely, the ethical considerations surrounding GenAI, especially Large Language Model (LLM) utilization in life sciences and agribusiness, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the equitable distribution of benefits, must be addressed to ensure responsible and fair implementation, especially environment sustainability when utilizing this technology.

    abstract = {The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), powered by Transformer networks, has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, computer vision, and graphics. However, the application of Transformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing boundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep learning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models pose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric definitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete data Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous geometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed) into Bézier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without discretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method that organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens suitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological characteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer’s attention mechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of boundary elements in a B-rep model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art performance in part classification and feature recognition tasks.},

    abstract = {Imagine a world where chatbots are the first responders to crises, efficiently addressing concerns and providing crucial information. ChatGPT has demonstrated the capability of GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)-powered chatbots when deployed to answer crisis-related questions in a timely and cost-efficient manner, thus replacing humans in crisis communication. However, public reactions to such messages remain unknown. To address this problem, this study recruited participants (N1 = 399, N2 = 189, and N3 = 121) and conducted two online vignette experiments and a qualitative survey. The results suggest that, when organizations fail to handle crisis-related requests, stakeholders exhibit higher satisfaction and lower responsibility attribution to chatbots providing instructing (vs. adjusting) information, as they are perceived to be more competent. However, when organizations satisfy requests, chatbots that provide adjusting (vs. instructing information) lead to higher satisfaction and lower responsibility attribution due to higher perceived competence. The second experiment involving a public emergency crisis scenario reveals that, regardless of the information provided (instructing or adjusting), stakeholders exhibit greater satisfaction and positive attitudes toward high-competence (vs. low-competence) chatbots. The qualitative study further confirms the experimental findings and offers insights to improve crisis chatbots. These findings contribute to the literature by extending situational crisis communication theory to nonhuman touchpoints and providing a deeper understanding of using chatbots in crisis communication through the lens of machine heuristics. The study also offers practical guidance for organizations to strategically integrate chatbots and human agents in crisis management based on context.},

    abstract = {Background
Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) has exhibited great potential in the treatment of food allergy. However, there is no global consensus on best practices of OIT. Parents of allergic children often struggle with concerns regarding OIT methodology, safety, and lack of accessible educational resources. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot from OpenAI recognized for its ability to formulate human-like conversations. Although applications of artificial intelligence in medical settings continue to be explored, the effectiveness of ChatGPT as an educational resource remains unknown for OIT.
Objective
To assess the accuracy of ChatGPT as a self-guided educational resource for parents with children undergoing OIT.
Methods
A total of 14 common questions from parents regarding OIT were entered into ChatGPT version 3.5 and answers were copied verbatim. These responses were then categorized into basic, advanced, or medical, and evaluated by Allergy-Immunology health care practitioners from North America and the United Kingdom using a 10-point Likert scale. Response readability, understandability, and reproducibility were assessed using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade level scores, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool, and natural language processing tools, respectively.
Results
The average median rankings by the practitioners per category were 8.6, 8.4, and 7.8 for basic, advanced, and medical, respectively. ChatGPT responses exhibited low readability scores, corresponding with a high-grade reading level. Understandability was between 73% to 84%, with scores decreased owing to response complexity. When assessing reproducibility, ChatGPT responses achieved rates between 83% and 93%.
Conclusion
Our results revealed that ChatGPT provides intelligible and comprehensive responses to patient questions. Health care practitioners polled were generally positive but identified important limitations.},

This study investigates how Chinese EFL learners interact with ChatGPT in an argumentative writing task and examines the influence of student-chatbot collaboration on the quality of writing, as well as students' perceptions of ChatGPT as a writing collaborator. Conducted at a tier-one university in China, this study involved nine students with over ten years of English learning experience and upper-intermediate English proficiency. Participants completed an argumentative writing task with ChatGPT, followed by semi-structured interviews. Data from interaction logs, think-aloud protocols, final writing texts, and interviews were qualitatively analysed. Findings revealed a “student-directed, chatbot-mediated” interaction mode, where students actively directed the writing process and used ChatGPT to enhance idea generation, develop arguments, provide evidence, and support language use. ChatGPT also contributed to lexical and syntactic variety, offering feedback on grammar and genre conventions. Students perceived ChatGPT as a helpful tool for inspiring ideas and improving language expression. Compared to peer collaboration, ChatGPT was seen as advantageous due to its advanced language proficiency, extensive knowledge base, and flexibility. However, some students reported challenges, such as difficulties in processing the vast amount of information provided by ChatGPT and frustrations when the chatbot did not fully understand their needs or provided unexpected responses.

The evolutionary stable strategies of participants under different constraints are scrutinized, which assists in exploring the impact of Gen-AI empowerment on the decision strategies of the three involved parties. Besides, simulation experiments are performed to investigate the impact of different parameter changes on the game's tripartite decisions. Results indicate that the costs, profits, and potential risks associated with Gen-AI empowerment are crucial considerations for the supplier and platform. Moreover, even with Gen-AI empowerment, the platform's revenue may decline if customers reduce their purchase frequency due to passive service from the group leader. As a result, the platform is more inclined to adopt Gen-AI empowerment when the group leader provides active service.},

Existing studies often focus on specific domains without addressing broader trust-building mechanisms or the cognitive and motivational factors needed for sustained engagement. This study investigates how trust shapes the adoption of GAI-driven sustainability recommendations by integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) into a single framework. Using data from sustainability-oriented users, we examine how central route constructs-perceived information quality and utility-peripheral route constructs-anthropomorphism and interaction quality-enhance trust, while perceived information complexity and perceived risk moderate these relationships. Our findings indicate that high-quality, useful information enhances trust through cognitive engagement, whereas anthropomorphic design and interaction quality reinforce trust via the heuristic route. However, excessive complexity and privacy concerns undermine trust, highlighting the need for clearer communication and data transparency. This study broadens theoretical understanding by extending ELM and EVT to the context of GAI-driven sustainability efforts, providing an integrated framework that encompasses cognitive and motivational trust drivers. These insights fill gaps in technology adoption research and offer practical guidance for developing GAI platforms that effectively support pro-environmental behavior change.},

    abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to explore employees’ perceptions and firsthand experiences of the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) productivity tools, specifically Microsoft 365 Copilot, on individual and collective learning processes within a multinational corporation. In doing so, the study provides insights into how these tools can shape workplace learning dynamics, fostering both individual skill development and collaborative knowledge-sharing practices.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors collected responses from 357 participants through a survey that included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. This study focuses exclusively on the qualitative responses. The reflexive thematic analysis method was used to capture and interpret employees’ perceptions of the role of Microsoft 365 Copilot – a generative AI-powered assistant integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite of applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) – in enhancing their work and learning opportunities in the workplace.
Findings
The results highlight four key themes contributing to workplace learning. At the individual level, Task Support illustrates the extent to which generative AI productivity tools transform work practices and facilitate both formal and informal learning pathways, while Meaningful Work underscores the tools’ role in enhancing employees’ foundational knowledge through enriched information. At the organisational level, organisational culture suggests the importance of fostering a supportive environment for AI integration, while organisational socialisation highlights its influence on team cohesion and the informal knowledge-sharing processes essential for effective collaboration within and among team members.
Practical implications
The results of this study offer actionable insights for organisations integrating generative AI productivity tools in the workplace. Understanding employees’ perceptions of the role of AI in workplace learning can inform the design of targeted training programmes that promote individual skill development and foster collaborative knowledge sharing. Furthermore, a supportive organisational culture that positions AI as a complementary resource can improve employee engagement, reduce resistance to new technologies and encourage a growth-oriented mindset, ultimately driving both personal and organisational development.
Originality/value
This study shifts the narrative around the role of AI in the workplace by examining how generative AI productivity tools can enhance workplace learning at both individual and organisational levels, rather than focusing solely on their potential to disrupt work through displacement and automation. By positioning AI-based applications as complementary to human work, this approach highlights their potential as enablers of skill development, knowledge sharing and job enrichment, fostering a more adaptive and learning-oriented work environment.},

    abstract = {Background
The potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to promote mental health is of great interest. Specifically, there is growing interest in integrating applied GenAI into psychotherapy or into the teacher/parent-child relationship. This paper describes CanvasHero, a GenAI tool that was developed following the devastating attacks on Israel in October 2023. It aims to promote resilience in children and adolescents who were evacuated from their homes due to the war. CanvasHero serves as a proof of concept for integrating GenAI as an additional element that can enrich and deepen interpersonal interaction.
Tool description
CanvasHero utilizes the BASIC Ph model and 6-Part Story Method for assessing and bolstering coping skills, aided by the interactive scaffolding and synthetic abilities of the GenAI. Key stages comprise (1) collaborative narrative construction between child, meaningful adult, and the GAI; (2) analysis of resilience themes; and (3) generative visualization representing the child's story through DALL-E's imaging capabilities.
Implementation protocol
The CanvasHero is optimally designed for children ages 7–16 under adult supervision, with the HEART Checklist developed to structure this process. Sessions typically occur remotely via videoconference, or in person.
Intended outcomes
CanvasHero aims to create a playful space for processing stress and trauma, identifies resilience resources, and strengthens these capabilities. At the same time, risks in GenAI integration are mitigated via human oversight and an ethics-focused design.
Conclusion
CanvasHero exemplifies a GenAI application that can assist during wartime, serving as a psycho-educational mediator and facilitating an imaginative and playful space between children and meaningful adults. Further studies are required to evaluate effectiveness and potential risks.},

    abstract = {The increasing demand for population-wide genomic screening and the limited availability of genetic counseling resources have created a pressing need for innovative service delivery models. Chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in genomic services, particularly in pretest counseling, but their application in returning positive population-wide genomic screening results remains underexplored. Leveraging advanced LLMs like GPT-4 offers an opportunity to address this gap by delivering accurate, contextual, and user-centered communication to individuals receiving positive genetic test results. This project aimed to design, implement, and evaluate a chatbot integrated with GPT-4, tailored to support the return of positive genomic screening results in the context of South Carolina’s In Our DNA SC program. This initiative offers free genetic screening to 100,000 individuals, with over 33,000 results returned and numerous positive findings for conditions such as Lynch syndrome, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, and familial hypercholesterolemia. A 3-step prompt engineering process using retrieval-augmented generation and few-shot techniques was used to create the chatbot. Training materials included patient frequently asked questions, genetic counseling scripts, and patient-derived queries. The chatbot underwent iterative refinement based on 13 training questions, while performance was evaluated through expert ratings on responses to 2 hypothetical patient scenarios. The 2 scenarios were intended to represent common but distinct patient profiles in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, age, and background knowledge. Domain experts rated the chatbot using a 5-point Likert scale across 8 predefined criteria: tone, clarity, program accuracy, domain accuracy, robustness, efficiency, boundaries, and usability. The chatbot achieved an average score of 3.86 (SD 0.89) across all evaluation metrics. The highest-rated criteria were tone (mean 4.25, SD 0.71) and usability (mean 4.25, SD 0.58), reflecting the chatbot’s ability to communicate effectively and provide a seamless user experience. Boundary management (mean 4.0, SD 0.76) and efficiency (mean 3.88, SD 1.08) also scored well, while clarity and robustness received ratings of 3.81 (SD 1.05) and 3.81 (SD 0.66), respectively. Domain accuracy was rated 3.63 (SD 0.96), indicating satisfactory performance in delivering genetic information, whereas program accuracy received the lowest score of 3.25 (SD 1.39), highlighting the need for improvements in delivering program-specific details. This project demonstrates the feasibility of using LLM-powered chatbots to support the return of positive genomic screening results. The chatbot effectively handled open-ended patient queries, maintained conversational boundaries, and delivered user-friendly responses. However, enhancements in program-specific accuracy are essential to maximize its utility. Future research will explore hybrid chatbot designs that combine the strengths of LLMs with rule-based components to improve scalability, accuracy, and accessibility in genomic service delivery. The findings underscore the potential of generative artificial intelligence tools to address resource limitations and improve the accessibility of genomic health care services.},

    abstract = {Background
Evidence is limited in gynecologic cancers on best practices for clinical trial screening, but the risk of ineffective screening processes and subsequent under-enrollment introduces significant cost to patient, healthcare systems, and scientific advancement. Absence of a defined screening process makes determination of who and when to screen potential patients inconsistent allowing inefficiency and potential introduction of biases. This is especially germane as generative artificial intelligence (AI), and electronic health record (EHR) integration is applied to trial screening. Though often a requirement of cooperative groups such as the Cancer therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and/or the Commission on Cancer (CoC), there are no standard practice guidelines on best practices regarding screening and how best to track screening data.
Development of manuscript
The authors provided a review of current clinical trial screening practices and the effect on enrollment and trial activation across a variety of disease and practice sites. Established clinical trial screening practices and evidence supporting emerging strategies were reviewed and reported. Due to lack of published literature in gynecologic oncology, authors sought to survey the members of current rostered GOG sites to provide perspectives on clinical trial screening practices. Survey results showed a variety of screening practices. Most respondents participate in some type of manual screening process, where approximately 13 % also report incorporating AI or EHR integration. Over half (60 %) of sites track screening data to use for feasibility when opening new trials. The rapid increase in generative AI, EHR integration, and site agnostic screening initiatives could provide a significant opportunity to improve screening efficiency, translating to improved enrollment, but limitations and barriers remain.},

These techniques, although powerful, require a high computational cost, which limits their use in real-time applications, embedded devices, and environmental monitoring systems, where computational resources are often limited. Therefore, this work presents an approach based on compact latent diffusion, where the denoising model uses attention channels and residual block operations. In addition, we evaluated different training loss functions, which help the model perform cloud removal across various land cover types. Considering a resource-constrained approach, we investigated different experimental configurations using Pareto Front to optimize the most promising experiments.

    abstract = {Background
People experiencing homelessness have worse oral health outcomes and a notable health informational asymmetry compared to the general population. Screening programs present a viable option for this population; however, barriers to access, such as lower levels of health literacy, lack of information, and mistrust, narrow their chances to participate in such programs.
Objective
The aim of this study is to investigate the applicability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in designing a homeless health screening program fact sheet with experts by experience using co-design principles.
Methods
Six fact sheet text variants were created by the open-access version of ChatGPT 3.5 for an oral cancer screening program targeting people experiencing homelessness in Budapest, Hungary. Clients of homeless social services (N=23) were invited to a short questionnaire survey and 3 semistructured focus group discussions between May and July 2024. General opinions regarding generative AI technology and direct feedback on the text variants were obtained. Additionally, a standardized readability assessment of the text variants was completed via the Sydney Health Literacy Lab Editor.
Results
Almost two-thirds of participants (17/23) stated that they had previously heard about AI; however, their self-assessment regarding the extent of their knowledge resulted in an average of 2.38 (n=16) on a 5-point Likert scale. During the first focus group discussion, all 6 variants received a high score (between 4.63 and 4.92 on a 5-point Likert scale). In the next sessions, participants remained positive when the pool was narrowed to 4 versions, although they scored the texts lower. During open discussions, text variants were considered understandable, while difficulties with medical expressions, lengthiness of sentences, and references to a stereotypical homeless subgroup (rough sleepers) were also reported. The health literacy editor showed that most AI-generated text variants were difficult to read and too complex for the target group.
Conclusions
The co-design process revealed that focus group participants actively wanted to shape the fact sheet drafts. They shared their insights on how to make the text variants more appealing for the target audience. Moreover, the involvement of generative AI technology revealed that the participants have heard about the concept of AI and text generation as a potential function, and they have not rejected its use in health care settings.},

    abstract = {The concept of “code” connotes different meanings, intentions, and formalizations. From mathematics and computer sciences to psychology and culture, the term becomes less formal, more diverse, and sometimes appears ambiguous. In biology a growing number of codes ignite a debate about their role in evolution, biocomplexity, and agency, to name just a few. Here, a transdisciplinary group of code scientists attempts to capture the big picture of code research across their fields of interest. In this cross-sectional overview commonalities emerge that may pave the way towards a unified theory of life-based-on-codes. Codes underly cellular processes, perception, cognition, and communication. From ecosystems to human language, codes influence how individuals behave in groups, memorize, learn, and take part in cultural practices. Emotions like aggression, fear, anger, frustration, are important motivators of behaviour modulating mutual communication and sculpting individual experience. The inheritance of experience in form of innate release mechanisms, stereotyped behaviour, or archetypes may have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots that rely on codes and impact our conscious decision making. Unconsciously, even our dreams draw on codes. In the future, conflation of different coding systems, e.g., from synthetic biology and generative artificial intelligence, will merge biological codes with machine logic and computer language to promote next-level transhumanism. Codes emerge as a currency converter between systems of life and between different scientific disciplines.},

The role that GenAIs can play in engineering research is addressed. The related previous works report on the potential of GenAIs in the literature review process. However, such potential is not demonstrated by case studies and practical examples. The previous works also do not address how GenAIs can assist with all the steps traditionally taken to design research. This study examines the effectiveness of collaboration with GenAIs at various stages of research design. It explores whether collaboration with GenAIs can result in more focused and comprehensive outcomes. A generalised approach for collaboration with AI tools in research design is proposed. A case study to develop a research design on the concept of “shared machine-human driving” is deployed to show the validity of the articulated concepts. The case study demonstrates both the pros and cons of collaboration with GenAIs. The results generated at each stage are rigorously validated and thoroughly examined to ensure they remain free from inaccuracies or hallucinations and align with the original research objectives. When necessary, the results are manually adjusted and refined to uphold their integrity and accuracy. The findings produced by the various GenAI models utilized in this study highlight the key attributes of generative artificial intelligence, namely speed, efficiency, and scope. However, they also underscore the critical importance of researcher oversight, as unexamined inferences and interpretations can render the results irrelevant or meaningless.},

    abstract = {A generative adversarial network (GAN) consists of a generator and a discriminator, which extract features and compete through min–max optimization in a zero-sum two-player game. Reinforcement learning (RL) enables a decision maker (agent) to observe, learn, and select optimal actions within a dynamic environment over time. The combination of these two artificial intelligence approaches, referred to as GAN-RL, presents a powerful synergy that leverages their strengths while addressing their respective limitations. This paper provides the first comprehensive review that systematically examines GAN-RL, offering an in-depth analysis of its theoretical foundations, key methodologies, and diverse applications. Specifically, we categorize GAN-RL approaches based on five primary objectives: (a) generating comprehensive synthetic datasets for training; (b) minimizing the discrepancies between value (or cumulative reward) distributions, where the cumulative reward is defined as the total sum of rewards an agent accumulates over the course of its interactions with the environment; (c) predicting the next scenario; (d) predicting the gradient of the generator in discrete tasks; and (e) learning from demonstrations. Our analysis highlights how GAN-RL enhances system performance, including improvements in cumulative reward, convergence rate, and prediction accuracy. By identifying open challenges and future research directions, this review fills a critical gap in the literature and serves as a valuable resource for researchers exploring the intersection of GANs and RL.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in clinical pharmacy; yet, systematic evaluation of their efficacy, limitations, and risks across diverse practice scenarios remains limited.
Objective
This study aims to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of 8 mainstream generative AI systems across 4 core clinical pharmacy scenarios—medication consultation, medication education, prescription review, and case analysis with pharmaceutical care—using a multidimensional framework.
Methods
Forty-eight clinically validated questions were selected via stratified sampling from real-world sources (eg, hospital consultations, clinical case banks, and national pharmacist training databases). Three researchers simultaneously tested 8 different generative AI systems (ERNIE Bot, Doubao, Kimi, Qwen, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) using standardized prompts within a single day (February 20, 2025). A double-blind scoring design was used, with 6 experienced clinical pharmacists (≥5 years experience) evaluating the AI responses across 6 dimensions: accuracy, rigor, applicability, logical coherence, conciseness, and universality, scored 0‐10 per predefined criteria (eg, −3 for inaccuracy and −2 for incomplete rigor). Statistical analysis used one-way ANOVA with Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) post hoc testing and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for interrater reliability (2-way random model). Qualitative thematic analysis identified recurrent errors and limitations.
Results
DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek) achieved the highest overall performance (mean composite score: medication consultation 9.4, SD 1.0; case analysis 9.3, SD 1.0), significantly outperforming others in complex tasks (P<.05). Critical limitations were observed across models, including high-risk decision errors—75% omitted critical contraindications (eg, ethambutol in optic neuritis) and a lack of localization—90% erroneously recommended macrolides for drug-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (China’s high-resistance setting), while only DeepSeek-R1 aligned with updated American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for pediatric doxycycline. Complex reasoning deficits: only Claude-3.5-Sonnet detected a gender-diagnosis contradiction (prostatic hyperplasia in female); no model identified diazepam’s 7-day prescription limit. Interrater consistency was lowest for conciseness in case analysis (ICC=0.70), reflecting evaluator disagreement on complex outputs. ERNIE Bot (Baidu) consistently underperformed (case analysis: 6.8, SD 1.5; P<.001 vs DeepSeek-R1).
Conclusions
While generative AI shows promise as a pharmacist assistance tool, significant limitations—including high-risk errors (eg, contraindication omissions), inadequate localization, and complex reasoning gaps—preclude autonomous clinical decision-making. Performance stratification highlights DeepSeek-R1’s current advantage, but all systems require optimization in dynamic knowledge updating, complex scenario reasoning, and output interpretability. Future deployment must prioritize human oversight (human-AI co-review), ethical safeguards, and continuous evaluation frameworks.},

    abstract = {Background
Artificial intelligence is becoming a part of daily life and the medical field. Generative artificial intelligence models, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, are experiencing a surge in popularity due to their enhanced performance and reliability. However, the application of these models in specialized domains, such as occupational medicine, remains largely unexplored.
Objective
This study aims to assess the potential suitability of a generative large language model, such as ChatGPT, as a support tool for medical research and even clinical decisions in occupational medicine in Germany.
Methods
In this randomized controlled study, the usability of ChatGPT for medical research and clinical decision-making was investigated using a web application developed for this purpose. Eligibility criteria were being a physician or medical student. Participants (N=56) were asked to work on 3 cases of occupational lung diseases and answer case-related questions. They were allocated via coin weighted for proportions of physicians in each group into 2 groups. One group researched the cases using an integrated chat application similar to ChatGPT based on the latest GPT-4-Turbo model, while the other used their usual research methods, such as Google, Amboss, or DocCheck. The primary outcome was case performance based on correct answers, while secondary outcomes included changes in specific question accuracy and self-assessed occupational medicine expertise before and after case processing. Group assignment was not traditionally blinded, as the chat window indicated membership; participants only knew the study examined web-based research, not group specifics.
Results
Participants of the ChatGPT group (n=27) showed better performance in specific research, for example, for potentially hazardous substances or activities (eg, case 1: ChatGPT group 2.5 hazardous substances that cause pleural changes versus 1.8 in a group with own research; P=.01; Cohen r=–0.38), and led to an increase in self-assessment with regard to specialist knowledge (from 3.9 to 3.4 in the ChatGPT group vs from 3.5 to 3.4 in the own research group; German school grades between 1=very good and 6=unsatisfactory; P=.047). However, clinical decisions, for example, whether an occupational disease report should be filed, were more often made correctly as a result of the participant’s own research (n=29; eg, case 1: Should an occupational disease report be filed? Yes for 7 participants in the ChatGPT group vs 14 in their own research group; P=.007; odds ratio 6.00, 95% CI 1.54‐23.36).
Conclusions
ChatGPT can be a useful tool for targeted medical research, even for rather specific questions in occupational medicine regarding occupational diseases. However, clinical decisions should currently only be supported and not made by the large language model. Future systems should be critically assessed, even if the initial results are promising.

    abstract = {In the past few decades, the problem of automating the sizing task of analog integrated circuit (IC) design has been a popular topic of research in the electronic design automation community. Traditionally, metaheuristics and optimization-based approaches have been explored to address this challenge, but each method has its own drawbacks and/or yield inefficient results’ production. Alternatively, recent advances in machine learning have also brought new perspectives at solving this particular problem. Particularly, artificial neural networks have been used in some works, but there is the common hurdle of small sizing datasets available to train the models in a supervised manner, and the fact that these models lack the ability to generalize beyond/outside their training data, as well as their tendency to fall into mode collapse. Therefore, to overcome these issues, in this paper, the focus is given on using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), a category of state-of-the-art diffusion models, to tackle the inverse problem of analog IC sizing. These models are trained to automatically determine the sizing of an analog IC when given only the set of constraints for its performance metrics. Several DDPM architectures are trained to gradually learn to remove noise, meaning that after training, they can produce new data from random noise samples. While previous work has shown that even a simple DDPM can sample promising sizing solutions in a small amount of time, this work takes one step further by employing a transformer architecture as the backbone of the model, learning a velocity equation of how the data changes between the noise addition steps. 100 sampled points are generated under 1 s, while revealing improved functional performance over other points generated by state-of-the-art approaches. These points can then be utilized as a starting point for further simulation-based optimizations until non-dominated optimal solutions are found. The use of these starting points saves, in some cases, more than 20,000 simulations when compared with randomized starting points, proving the model and pipeline’s efficiency. This work presents the first extensive study in the literature on the use of diffusion models to tackle the inverse problem of analog IC sizing, targeting multiple circuit topologies and integration technologies.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) are revolutionizing computing education, causing paradigm shifts from the traditional teaching and learning technique. Studies are exploring GenAI tools in computing classes from intro to advanced topics with the aim to showcase how to reshape computing education in this new era of GenAI. This study examined the computing education research landscape to unravel how GenAI tools have been used in that domain, what are the characteristics of those studies in terms of computing topics, context, and tools, offering insights into the pros and cons for integrating GenAI in computing education based on the performance indicators reported in the literature. This study employed a systematic literature review approach to identify and analyze 78 relevant articles. The findings of this study show that educators are exploring GenAI tools in computer sciences classes from K-12 through graduate levels. Beyond programming education, GenAI has also been explored in college upper-level computer science courses such as Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction. The performance analysis of these tools are presented in this study, indicating a progressive advancement from when the technology was introduced. This study also discusses learning outcomes, good practices, and potential risks to avoid when exploring GenAI, as reported in the studies, which could guide how computing educators design their instructional strategies using GenAI. This study contributes to broadening the understanding of exploring, adapting, or using GenAI in computer science education and may spark interest among educators who are unwilling to explore GenAI or may not understand how or what strategies to adopt.},

This impact is likely to accelerate and become even more significant as the computational potential of generative AI grows through training on more diverse and more extensive language models and data sets. Emerging research in this new field suggests that previous models of understanding the interactions between machine and human may no longer be sufficient in a world of generative AI. The significant question is how emerging generative AI technologies will relate to and be a part of human creativity and creative outputs. In this article, we adopt a posthuman stance and conceive of creative output involving generative AI and humans in terms of a yet-to-be-fully-realised and emergent relationship that will likely become more integrated and complex. To investigate and experiment with this relational notion, each of us (as part of an autoethnographic approach) developed a creative output using ChatGPT: a poem and a multimodal narrative. We then employed the idea of alterity relations from the American philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, to conceive of the possibilities and limitations in working relationally and productively with generative AI. As two academics working in teacher education, we applied our learning from this exploration to possibilities in educational contexts. In this article, we offer several important implications and provocations for practitioners, researchers, educators and policymakers, not only in terms of practical concerns but also for rethinking the nature of the creative output.},

Yet, what occurs when individuals, who have developed a dependency on it, find ChatGPT inaccessible? In this study, we examine the impact of both the presence and absence of ChatGPT on sustained creative output and content homogeneity, leveraging two complementary methodologies: a natural experiment (Study 1) and a controlled laboratory experiment with extended follow-ups (Study 2). Study 1 analyzed 419,344 academic papers published before and after ChatGPT-3.5’s release across all subjects categorized by Web of Science (i.e., Physical Science, Life Sciences & Biomedicine, Technology, Social Science, Arts & Humanities). Study 2, a seven-day laboratory experiment with two follow-up surveys, collected 3,593 original ideas and 427 solutions across 18 different creative tasks, with half of participants using ChatGPT-4. We find that although generative AI helps scholars to publish more academic works in higher-ranked journals and enhances individuals’ performance in creative tasks, such creativity drops remarkably upon withdrawal of AI assistance. Strikingly, the induced content homogeneity keeps climbing even months later. We resemble the latter as a creative scar inked in the temporal creativity trajectory. This research identity a creativity illusion that although generative AI can augment creative performance, users do not truly acquire the ability to create but easily lost it once generative AI is no longer available.},

    abstract = {Background
Stroke has a major impact on global health, causing long-term disability and straining health care resources. Generative large language models (gLLMs) have emerged as promising tools to help address these challenges, but their applications and reported performance in stroke care require comprehensive mapping and synthesis.
Objective
The aim of this scoping review was to consolidate a fragmented evidence base and examine the current landscape, shortcomings, and future directions in the design, reporting, and evaluation of gLLM-based interventions in stroke care.
Methods
In this scoping review, which adhered to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and the Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework, we searched 6 major scientific databases in December 2024 for gLLM-based interventions across the stroke care pathway, mapping their key characteristics and outcomes.
Results
A total of 25 studies met the predefined eligibility criteria and were included for analysis. Retrospective designs predominated (n=16, 64%). Key applications of gLLMs included clinical decision-making support (n=10, 40%), administrative assistance (n=9, 36%), direct patient interaction (n=5, 20%), and automated literature review (n=1, 4%). Implementations mainly used generative pretrained transformer models accessed through task-prompted chat interfaces. In total, 5 key challenges were identified from the included studies during the implementation of gLLM-based interventions: ensuring factual alignment, maintaining system robustness, enhancing interpretability, optimizing efficiency, and facilitating clinical adoption.
Conclusions
The application of gLLMs in stroke care, while promising, remains relatively new, with most interventions reflecting early-stage or relatively simple implementations. Against this backdrop, critical gaps in research and clinical translation persist. To support the development of clinically impactful and trustworthy applications, we propose an actionable framework that prioritizes real-world evidence, mandates transparent technical reporting, broadens evaluation beyond output accuracy, strengthens validation of advanced task adaptation strategies, and investigates mechanisms for safe and effective human-gLLM interaction.},

Motivated by advances in generative artificial intelligence techniques, a data-driven diffusion generative approach using implicit surface representation for energy-absorbing metamaterial design is proposed. This approach utilizes the diffusion model to learn the conditional distribution of metamaterial based on specified mechanical properties, converting target properties into potential metamaterial topologies. Additionally, level set-based implicit surface representation ensures that the generated metamaterials have high-quality geometric shapes and clear boundary definitions, enhancing design flexibility while requiring fewer design variables. Numerical simulations and experimental results consistently verify that the proposed approach enables rapid and accurate design of metamaterials tailored to target mechanical performance. This method offers an innovative and efficient solution for the accelerated design of energy-absorbing metamaterials, providing a new perspective and approach to address complex engineering design challenges.},

To achieve effective evaluation of adsorption, machine learning (ML) strategies are increasingly being developed. However, no applicable data-driven ML models have been studied to predict the adsorption of SAs by BCs in water. Therefore, this study employed an ML approach based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) data augmentation to predict the adsorption of SAs on BCs in the aqueous phase. The results indicated that the WGAN could generate virtual data highly similar to the original adsorption dataset.

Image-based plant phenomics has progressed rapidly, and three-dimensional (3D) phenotyping is a valuable extension of traditional 2D phenomics. However, the increased data dimensionality poses challenges to feature extraction and phenotyping. In recent decades, deep learning has led to remarkable progress in revolutionizing 3D phenotyping. Therefore, this review highlights the importance of using deep learning in 3D plant phenomics. It systematically overviews the capabilities of deep learning for 3D computer vision, covering 3D representation, classification, detection and tracking, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and generation. Additionally, deep learning techniques for 3D point preprocessing (e.g., annotation, downsampling, and dataset organization) and various plant phenotyping tasks are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives associated with deep learning in 3D plant phenomics are summarized, including (1) benchmark dataset construction by using synthetic datasets and methods such as generative artificial intelligence and unsupervised or weakly supervised learning; (2) accurate and efficient 3D point cloud analysis by leveraging multitask learning, lightweight models, and self-supervised learning; and (3) deep learning for 3D plant phenomics by exploring interpretability, extensibility, and multimodal data utilization.

    abstract = {Background
The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in both clinical and consumer healthcare settings has surged exponentially. However, there remains limited evidence on their reliability and impact in cardiovascular practice.
Objectives
This scoping review was designed to consolidate the existing biomedical literature on applicability, reliability, and quality improvement strategies for the integration of LLMs into the cardiovascular domain. Following Cochrane methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) were systematically searched to identify pertinent studies published between August 2020 and February 2025. Articles addressing the development, implementation, and assessment of LLMs in cardiovascular medicine were selected for comprehensive analysis.
Results
Twenty-five eligible publications evaluated the performance of LLMs in responding to cardiology-related questions, encompassing parameters such as accuracy, response latency, indirectness, completeness, and so on. The assessment methodology varied considerably across studies. LLMs demonstrated potential utility in cardiovascular decision-making, myocarditis management, cardiac arrest diagnosis and treatment, and image differentiation.
Conclusions
Although some LLM-generated responses to cardiovascular-related questions exhibit acceptable levels of quality, significant drawbacks persist. These include verbosity, inaccuracies, occasional misinformation, inconsistent outputs to identical questions, bias, and poor reproducibility. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for continued refinement and validation.},

While previous studies have explored various pedagogical strategies to enhance problem-solving skills, the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in this domain remains underexplored. This study introduces the ChatGPT-supported Mathematics Problem-Solving System (ChatGPT-MPS), a GenAI-enabled learning environment designed to support primary students in developing problem-solving strategies and deepening conceptual understanding. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental design was employed involving 104 fifth-grade students, assigned to an experimental group (using ChatGPT-MPS) and a control group (traditional instruction). Both groups completed a pre- and post-tests of MPS and interests scale to evaluate their word problem-solving proficiency and learning interests. Quantitively data analysis and its results showed that the experimental group exhibited significantly greater improvements in post-test performance compared to the control group. In addition, student feedback revealed increased interest, perceived value, and motivation when engaging with the ChatGPT-MPS learning environment. These findings provide empirical support for the use of GenAI in mathematics education and demonstrate the potential of ChatGPT-MPS to enhance students' mathematical thinking and engagement in problem-solving tasks. The study contributes to the growing body of research on AI-driven personalized learning in primary education, offering insights into the design and implementation of effective GenAI-enabled learning environments.},

    abstract = {Background
Many members of Black American communities, faced with the high prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) within their demographic, find themselves taking on the role of informal caregivers. Despite being the primary individuals responsible for the care of individuals with ADRD, these caregivers often lack sufficient knowledge about ADRD-related health literacy and feel ill-prepared for their caregiving responsibilities. Generative AI has become a new promising technological innovation in the health care domain, particularly for improving health literacy; however, some generative AI developments might lead to increased bias and potential harm toward Black American communities. Therefore, rigorous development of generative AI tools to support the Black American community is needed.
Objective
The goal of this study is to test Lola, a multimodal mobile app, which, by relying on generative AI, facilitates access to ADRD-related health information by enabling speech and text as inputs and providing auditory, textual, and visual outputs.
Methods
To test our mobile app, we used the cognitive walk-through methodology, and we recruited 15 informal ADRD caregivers who were older than 50 years and part of the Black American community living within the region. We asked them to perform 3 tasks on the mobile app (ie, searching for an article on brain health, searching for local events, and finally, searching for opportunities to participate in scientific research in their area), then we recorded their opinions and impressions. The main aspects to be evaluated were the mobile app’s usability, accessibility, cultural relevance, and adoption.
Results
Our findings highlight the users’ need for a system that enables interaction with different modalities, the need for a system that can provide personalized and culturally and contextually relevant information, and the role of community and physical spaces in increasing the use of Lola.
Conclusions
Our study shows that, when designing for Black American older adults, a multimodal interaction with the generative AI system can allow individuals to choose their own interaction way and style based upon their interaction preferences and external constraints. This flexibility of interaction modes can guarantee an inclusive and engaging generative AI experience.},

    abstract = {Background & Aims
Early identification and accurate characterization of overt gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) enables opportunities to optimize patient management and ensures appropriately risk-adjusted coding for claims-based quality measures and reimbursement. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), create opportunities to support accurate identification of clinical conditions. In this study, we present the first LLM-based pipeline for identification of overt GIB in the electronic health record (EHR). We demonstrate 2 clinically relevant applications: the automated detection of recurrent bleeding and appropriate reimbursement coding for patients with GIB.
Methods
Development of the LLM-based pipeline was performed on 17,712 nursing notes from 1108 patients who were hospitalized with acute GIB and underwent endoscopy in the hospital from 2014 to 2023. The pipeline was used to train an EHR-based machine learning model for detection of recurrent bleeding on 546 patients presenting to 2 hospitals and externally validated on 562 patients presenting to 4 different hospitals. The pipeline was used to develop an algorithm for appropriate reimbursement coding on 7956 patients who underwent endoscopy in the hospital from 2019 to 2023.
Results
The LLM-based pipeline accurately detected melena (positive predictive value, 0.972; sensitivity, 0.900), hematochezia (positive predictive value, 0.900; sensitivity, 0.908), and hematemesis (positive predictive value, 0.859; sensitivity, 0.932). The EHR-based machine learning model identified recurrent bleeding with area under the curve of 0.986, sensitivity of 98.4%, and specificity of 97.5%. The reimbursement coding algorithm resulted in an average per-patient reimbursement increase of $1299 to $3247 with a total difference of $697,460 to $1,743,649.
Conclusions
An LLM-based pipeline can robustly detect overt GIB in the EHR with clinically relevant applications in detection of recurrent bleeding and appropriate reimbursement coding.},

This exploratory, mixed-methods study investigated how to design AI learning experiences using a human-centered approach that promotes student agency. We developed and investigated an integrated framework combining comprehensive generative AI literacies—functional, critical and ethical, and creative—with self-regulated learning (SRL) processes operationalized as a human-centered Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Thirty-eight undergraduate students enrolled in an “Artificial Intelligence and Writing” course completed scaffolded experiential challenges followed by self-directed creative projects. Quantitative analysis revealed significant growth in AI literacy self-efficacy across all dimensions, with students progressing from moderate initial confidence (M = 4.68, SD = 2.11) to high confidence levels (M = 8.39, SD = 1.04) on a 10-point scale (t = -9.86, p < .001). Qualitative analysis of project artifacts and student process reflections identified a taxonomy of human in the loop practices integrating AI literacies and self-regulation across the Plan, Iterate, Evaluate cycle. Planning practices involved activating domain knowledge to identify AI applications and establishing evaluative criteria. Iteration practices included developing multi-step workflows, refining prompts through dialogue, and monitoring output quality. Evaluation practices combined assessment of project outcomes with reflection on collaboration processes to inform future use. These practices illustrated adaptive human-AI collaboration strategies that augment rather than replace students’ disciplinary expertise and creative vision. These findings suggest scaffolded experiential learning integrating AI literacies and metacognitive processes can promote effective AI collaboration and empower students to actively direct their own learning.},

    abstract = {Effective teachers should be equipped to solve complex problems across diverse instructional and learning contexts. However, many teacher training programs struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge to real-world applications. The current study tackles this challenge by developing a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-enhanced simulation to improve preservice teachers’ problem-solving abilities. Using design-based research (DBR), we created a virtual environment that integrates problem-based learning (PBL) with GenAI technology. The simulation was rigorously refined through expert review and usability testing before being implemented in a teacher training program. We evaluated its effectiveness by comparing three groups: (1) a text-based scenario, (2) a rule-based simulation, and (3) a GenAI-enhanced simulation. Pre- and post-test results showed significant improvements in problem-solving skills for both the rule-based and GenAI-enhanced simulation groups compared to the text-based scenario group. Notably, qualitative findings revealed that students reported heightened realism and immersion in the GenAI-enhanced simulation, attributing this to more dynamic interactions with AI agents that helped them better contextualize PBL and increased their motivation. Our study findings contribute design principles for developing GenAI-enhanced simulations in teacher education, offering promising insights into leveraging AI technology to create more engaging and effective training experiences.},

    abstract = {Background
At the beginning of their clinical clerkships (CCs), medical students face multiple challenges related to acquiring clinical and communication skills, building professional relationships, and managing psychological stress. While mentoring and structured feedback are known to provide critical support, existing systems may not offer sufficient and timely guidance owing to the faculty’s limited availability. Generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, offers new opportunities to support medical education by providing context-sensitive responses.
Objective
This study aimed to develop a generative artificial intelligence CC mentor (AI-CCM) based on ChatGPT and evaluate its effectiveness in supporting medical students’ clinical learning, addressing their concerns, and supplementing human mentoring. The secondary objective was to compare AI-CCM’s educational value with responses from senior student mentors.
Methods
We conducted 2 studies. In study 1, we created 5 scenarios based on challenges that students commonly encountered during CCs. For each scenario, 5 senior student mentors and AI-CCM generated written advice. Five medical education experts evaluated these responses using a rubric to assess accuracy, practical utility, educational appropriateness (5-point Likert scale), and safety (binary scale). In study 2, a total of 17 fourth-year medical students used AI-CCM for 1 week during their CCs and completed a questionnaire evaluating its usefulness, clarity, emotional support, and impact on communication and learning (5-point Likert scale) informed by the technology acceptance model.
Results
All results indicated that AI-CCM achieved higher mean scores than senior student mentors. AI-CCM responses were rated higher in educational appropriateness (4.2, SD 0.7 vs 3.8, SD 1.0; P=.001). No significant differences with senior student mentors were observed in accuracy (4.4, SD 0.7 vs 4.2, SD 0.9; P=.11) or practical utility (4.1, SD 0.7 vs 4.0, SD 0.9; P=.35). No safety concerns were identified in AI-CCM responses, whereas 2 concerns were noted in student mentors’ responses. Scenario-specific analysis revealed that AI-CCM performed substantially better in emotional and psychological stress scenarios. In the student trial, AI-CCM was rated as moderately useful (mean usefulness score 3.9, SD 1.1), with positive evaluations for clarity (4.0, SD 0.9) and emotional support (3.8, SD 1.1). However, aspects related to feedback guidance (2.9, SD 0.9) and anxiety reduction (3.2, SD 1.0) received more neutral ratings. Students primarily consulted AI-CCM regarding learning workload and communication difficulties; few students used it to address emotional stress–related issues.
Conclusions
AI-CCM has the potential to serve as a supplementary educational partner during CCs, offering comparable support to that of senior student mentors in structured scenarios. Despite challenges of response latency and limited depth in clinical content, AI-CCM was received well by and accessible to students who used ChatGPT’s free version. With further refinements, including specialty-specific content and improved responsiveness, AI-CCM may serve as a scalable, context-sensitive support system in clinical medical education.},

    abstract = {Background
As artificial intelligence (AI) based tools become a more prevalent part of the work taking place in health and healthcare settings, students preparing for health profession roles will be asked with increasing frequency to adopt and integrate these tools into their developing knowledge and skills-sets. Because of this, developing an understanding of levels of AI acceptance, and the factors that play into that acceptance will be essential for supporting individuals training for health workforce roles and their collaborative work within and across disciplines.
Purpose
This paper describes the methodology utilized to create and then validate the Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale for Interprofessional Education (AAIPE). This validated scale is intended to measure health sector student levels of acceptance of artificial intelligence as a part of their workplace roles and responsibilities.
Method
The AAIPE scale was utilized at the conclusion of multi-discipline interprofessional education activity (N = 161).
Results
Analysis of the AAIPE results indicated moderate-to-high levels of internal consistency for scale items. Student participant AAIPE scores indicated neutral-to-moderately positive levels of acceptance overall without significant difference between students from different health sector academic programs.
Conclusions
This research uncovered lower levels of student acceptance of artificial intelligence's influence on professional ethics and AI's influence on role clarity. Higher levels of acceptance relating to AI as an evolving component of health sector work were also found. A discussion of these results relating to interprofessional education and practice is conducted.},

    abstract = {Synthetic data is crucial in information fusion in term of enhancing data representation and improving system robustness. Among all synthesis methods, deep generative models exhibit excellent performance. However, recent studies have shown that the generation process faces privacy challenges due to the memorization of training instances by generative models. To maximize the benefits of synthesis data while ensuring data security, we propose a novel framework for the generation and utilization of private synthetic data in information fusion processes. Furthermore, we present differential private adaptive fine-tuning (DP-AdaFit), a method for private parameter efficient fine-tuning that applies differential privacy only to the singular values of the incremental updates. In details, DP-AdaFit adaptively adjusts the rank of the low-rank weight increment matrices according to their importance score, and allows us to achieve an equivalent privacy policy by only injecting noise into gradient of the corresponding singular values. Such a novel approach essentially reduces their parameter budget but avoids too much noise introduced by the singular value decomposition. We decrease the cost on memory and computation nearly half of the SOTA, and achieve the FID of 19.2 on CIFAR10. Our results demonstrate that trading off weights contained in the differential privacy fine-tuning parameters can improve model performance, even achieving generation quality competitive with differential privacy full fine-tuning diffusion model. Our code is available at DP-AdaFit.},

Short-Term Load Forecasting is of great significance for the economic and stable operation of the power system. Against the background of the breakthrough in generative artificial intelligence based on the Diffusion model, the research on relevant load forecasting methods of the latter is still relatively limited. Therefore, this paper refers to many related excellent works, analyzes the commonalities between image generation tasks and load forecasting tasks, and proposes the Diffusion-based Inpainting Forecasting Method (DIFM). DIFM supports multi-variable inputs and can achieve functions such as load sequence generation, quantile forecasting and missing data imputation, making it a flexible and multifunctional method. The feasibility and performance of this method are validated across multiple datasets, with experimental results revealing that DIFM reduces the mean absolute percentage error by 24.61 % and 17.91 % respectively in short-term load forecasting and load imputation tasks compared to the optimal benchmark models.},

To identify and quantify ability bias in generative artificial intelligence large language model chatbots, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.
Design
Observational study of language usage in generative artificial intelligence models.
Setting
Investigation-only browser profile restricted to ChatGPT and Gemini.
Participants
Each chatbot generated 60 descriptions of people prompted without specified functional status, 30 descriptions of people with a disability, 30 descriptions of patients with a disability, and 30 descriptions of athletes with a disability (N=300).
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures
Generated descriptions produced by the models were parsed into words that were linguistically analyzed into favorable qualities or limiting qualities.
Results
Both large language models significantly underestimated disability in a population of people, and linguistic analysis showed that descriptions of people, patients, and athletes with a disability were generated as having significantly fewer favorable qualities and significantly more limitations than people without a disability in both ChatGPT and Gemini.
Conclusions
Generative artificial intelligence chatbots demonstrate quantifiable ability bias and often exclude people with disabilities in their responses. Ethical use of these generative large language model chatbots in medical systems should recognize this limitation, and further consideration should be taken in developing equitable artificial intelligence technologies.},

Throughout seven-week's instruction, quantitative data were collected with pre- and post-questionnaires of writing self-efficacy and critical thinking ability. The results revealed no statistical difference in terms of both critical thinking ability and writing self-efficacy even with greater increase among the experimental group than that of the control peers. Further analysis of each dimension demonstrated the statistical difference of language construction, indicating that vocational college students with limited language proficiency strive to promote language organization in their writings in terms of critical thinking ability development. The research contributes valuable empirical evidence of incorporating generative AI chatbots into L2 writing by extending the Cognitive Load Theory and Social Cognitive Theory.

@article{JONAHBARRETT2025,
    abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
Large language models (LLMs) show promise in radiology through various clinical applications as well as in assisting with research manuscript development. Recent studies show 52.6% of medical researchers use LLMs in manuscript development, with non-medical researchers showing similar rates. Given concerns about hallucinations, bias, etc., many publishers now require disclosure of LLM use. While most medical imaging journals have LLM policies as of 2025, the actual disclosure rates for LLM usage remain unknown. Our study examines trends in LLM disclosure by analyzing 1998 radiology publications for LLM disclosures.
Materials and Methods
A bibliometric analysis of nine radiology journals with LLM use disclosure requirements was performed. The study included primary investigations and secondary research while excluding short-form publications. The LLM disclosure rate was calculated overall. Logistic regression assessed temporal trends in disclosure rates, while a linear mixed effects model evaluated the relationship between disclosure status and peer review duration. Chi-square analysis examined associations between manuscript type and disclosure rates.
Results
Of 1998 manuscripts, 34 (1.7%) declared LLM use. Most disclosures involved ChatGPT (32, 94.1%), primarily for readability/grammar purposes (33, 97.1%). The majority of manuscripts disclosing LLM use originated from institutions in non-English speaking countries (22, 64.7%). No significant increase in disclosure rates over time was observed (OR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.98, 1.16], p=0.15), and no relationship with peer review duration (coefficient: −4.85, SE=11.25, p=0.67) was found. Secondary research manuscripts disclosed LLM use more frequently (3.9% vs. 1.3%, p<0.001) with a small effect size (Cramer's V: 0.08 [0.04, 1.00]).
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate remarkably low disclosure rates in radiology manuscripts despite surveys indicating significant LLM adoption among researchers. This discrepancy may result from true non-use, fear of stigma, perceived advantages of undisclosed use, disagreement with disclosure requirements for minor editing, or policy unawareness, among other reasons. These findings suggest a need for more accepting research environments that recognize legitimate LLM benefits while developing nuanced disclosure policies addressing risks.},

    abstract = {Context:
With the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools such as GitHub Copilot into development processes, developers can be supported when writing code.
Objectives:
As GitHub Copilot has a feature to provide up to ten solutions at once, we explore, how developers should approach those solutions with the goal of providing recommendations to achieve suitable trade-offs in finding correct solutions and checking solutions.
Methods:
In this study, we analyze a total of 2025 coding problems provided by LeetCode and 17048 solutions to solve these problems generated by GitHub Copilot in Python. We focus on three key issues: firstly, whether it is beneficial to consider multiple solutions; secondly, the impact of the position of a solution; and thirdly, the number of solutions that should be checked by a developer.
Results:
Overall, our results point to the following observations: (1) solutions are not less likely to be correct if they appear at later positions; (2) when looking for a solution to a common problem, checking four to five solutions is generally enough; (3) novel or difficult problems are unlikely to be solved by GitHub Copilot; (4) skipping the first solution is advised when considering only one solution, as the first solution is less likely to be correct; and (5) checking all solutions is necessary to not miss correct solutions, but the effort is usually not justified.
Conclusion:
Based on our study, we conclude that there is potential for improvement in better supporting developers. For instance, there are few cases where ten generated solutions provide more value than fewer solutions. Depending on the use scenario, it could be more useful if GitHub Copilot allowed developers to request a single, comprehensive solution.},

A Basic-element model is constructed to standardize multi-source data. The correlation degree between quantitative indices and predefined evaluation grades is quantified using the classical domain, joint domain, and dependent function. A subjective-objective dynamic weighting framework is established by integrating multiple methodologies, including the entropy weight method, CRITIC, game theory, and D-S evidence theory. By dynamically adjusting weights, the proposed approach resolves challenges related to data conflicts, redundancy, and dynamic variations within complex systems, significantly enhancing evaluation objectivity, adaptability, and decision-making accuracy. Finally, the paper explores pathways for integrating generative artificial intelligence with Extetics, providing theoretical and technical support for evaluating complex systems across multi-domains.},

To this end, we propose the Edge Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (EdgeAIGC) framework, which can effectively solve the problems brought by cloud computing by implementing in-situ processing of services close to the data source through edge computing. However, AIGC models usually have a large parameter scale and complex computing requirements, which poses a huge challenge to the storage and computing resources of edge devices. This paper focuses on the edge intelligence model caching and resource allocation problems in the EdgeAIGC framework, aiming to improve the cache hit rate and resource utilization of edge devices for models by optimizing the model caching strategy and resource allocation scheme, and realize in-situ AIGC service processing. With the optimization objectives of minimizing service request response time and execution cost in resource-constrained environments, we employ the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm for optimization. Experimental results show that, compared with other methods, our model caching and resource allocation strategies can effectively improve the cache hit rate by at least 41.06% and reduce the response cost.},

Methods
A Natural Language Processing Virtual Reality Communication Simulation (NLP-VRCS) was developed by integrating ChatGPT-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) with virtual reality to assist communication skills training. The empathy, communication confidence, and skills of nursing students trained using the NLP-VRCS (n = 53) were compared to those who received traditional training (n = 52) at baseline (T0), one week (T1), one month (T2), and two months after the training (T3).
Results
After the results were adjusted using generalized estimating equations, the experimental group scores regarding empathy, communication confidence, and communication skills at T1, T2, and T3 were significantly higher than those of the control group.

    abstract = {Background
The global surge in mental health challenges has placed unprecedented strain on health care systems, highlighting the need for scalable interventions to promote mental health self-care. Chatbots have emerged as promising tools by providing accessible, evidence-based support. While chatbots have shown promise in delivering mental health interventions, most studies have only focused on clinical populations and symptom reduction, leaving a critical gap in understanding their preventive potential for self-care and mental health literacy in the general population.
Objective
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a rule-based, topic-specific chatbot intervention in improving self-care efficacy, mental health literacy, self-care intention, self-care behaviors, and mental well-being immediately after 10 days and 1 month of its use.
Methods
A 2-arm, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 285 participants were randomly assigned to the chatbot intervention group (n=140) and a waitlist control group (n=145). The chatbot intervention consisted of 10 topic-specific sessions targeting stress management, emotion regulation, and value clarification, delivered over 10 days with a 7-day free-access period. Primary outcomes included self-care self-efficacy, behavioral intentions, self-care behaviors, and mental health literacy. Secondary outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and mental well-being. Assessments were self-administered on the web at baseline, 10 days after the intervention, and at a 1-month follow-up. All outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed models with an intention-to-treat approach, and effect sizes were calculated using Cohen d.
Results
Participants in the chatbot group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in behavioral intentions (F2,379.74=15.02; P<.001) and mental health literacy (F2,423.57=4.27; P=.02) compared to the control group. The chatbots were also able to bring significant improvement in self-care behaviors (Cohen d=0.36, 95% CI 0.08-0.30; P<.001), mindfulness (Cohen d=0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.38; P<.001), depressive symptoms (Cohen d=–0.26, 95% CI –1.77 to –0.26; P=.004), overall well-being (Cohen d=0.22, 95% CI 0.02-0.42; P=.02), and positive emotions (Cohen d=0.28, 95% CI 0.08-0.54; P=.004) after 10 days. However, these improvements did not differ significantly at 1 month when compared to the waitlist control group. Adherence was higher among participants who received push notifications (t138=–4.91; P<.001).
Conclusions
This study highlights the potential of rule-based chatbots in promoting mental health literacy and fostering short-term self-care intentions. However, the lack of sustained effects points to the necessary improvements required in chatbot design, including greater personalization and interactive features to enhance self-efficacy and long-term mental health outcomes. Future research should explore hybrid approaches that combine rule-based and generative artificial intelligence systems to optimize intervention effectiveness.

This study aimed to explore the effects of interactive teaching strategies based on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) under the guidance of outcome-based education (OBE) theory on higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy of undergraduate nursing students.
Background
Recently, GenAI-assisted teaching has been widely recognised as a trend in nursing education reform. HOTS and AI literacy are important for nursing students in the era of artificial intelligence. However, studies on the use of GenAI to enhance the HOTS and AI literacy of undergraduate nursing students are limited.
Design
A quasi-experimental study.
Methods
Based on OBE theory, interactive teaching strategies using GenAI were introduced into a nursing course. Overall, 132 third-year nursing undergraduates enrolled in this course were randomly divided into experimental (n = 66) and control groups (n = 66).
Results
After completing the course, the HOTS scores of nursing undergraduates (P = 0.018) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group. There was a significant difference in the HOTS scores (P < 0.001) and AI literacy (P < 0.001) between the experimental group before and after the course.
Conclusion
GenAI-assisted teaching could help nursing undergraduates improve their HOTS and AI literacy. As an important auxiliary teaching tool, GenAI should be integrated into other nursing courses and widely applied in nursing education in the future.},

However, empirical studies specifically investigating on GenAI’s role in mediating the revision stage of EFL learners’ L2 writing processes remain scarce. Notably, research exploring the connection between learners’ perceived perezhivaniya—derived from Vygotskyan theory, denoting an individual’’s subjective lived experiences—and their actual revision behaviors is particularly limited. To address this lacuna, we employed interviews, Q-methodology, and the Translog screen recording tool to investigate the revision processes of nineteen EFL learners at a university in Southern China as they revised L2 continuation writing tasks using GenAI. A key contribution of this study is the development of a novel seven-dimensional L2 writing revision taxonomy (word choice, content, discourse, syntax, errors, alignment, and typographic elements), which guided both the Q-questionnaire design and the Translog data coding. This framework uniquely facilitated a comparison between perceived perezhivaniya and actual revision behaviors by integrating online revision with offline reflective perceptions, thereby capturing an essential dynamic aspect of the concept of perezhivanie. Results indicated a strong consistency between most of the learners’ perceived experiences and their actual revision behaviors, in content, alignment, and typographic elements. However, for some learners, alignment—vital for continuation writing—was frequently overlooked despite its perceptual recognition, highlighting significant pedagogical implications.},

However, there is limited evidence pertaining to the impact of AI-mediated instruction on postgraduate students’ psycho-affective factors and the overall learning climate in English as a foreign language (EFL) context. To address this gap, the present study drew on motivational climate theory (MCT) to explore postgraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the role of GAI technologies in their emotional engagement and goal orientation. To do so, an interview was conducted with 30 postgraduate students using maximum variation sampling. The results of the inductive thematic analysis revealed that AI-mediated instruction had affected both the emotional engagement and goal orientation of the students. In particular, it was found that GAI tools fostered emotional engagement by ‘enlightening teacher-student classroom relationships’, ‘making the overall classroom culture/climate engaging, motivating, and updated’, ‘improving teachers’ action, instruction, and feedback quality’, ‘providing a personalized, interactive, and autonomy supporting education’, and ‘taping into learner-specific idiosyncrasies and individual differences’. Furthermore, GAI tools affected the students’ goal orientation by ‘facilitating the mastery of course content’, ‘setting personalized and achievable goals’, ‘fostering students’ performance comparison in the classroom’, and ‘providing a reflective and adaptive learning environment’. The findings are discussed and implications are provided for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers concerning the interplay of GAI, emotions, goal orientation, and motivational climate.},

    abstract = {While engagement has been widely recognized as a key factor in improving students’ learning outcomes, the role of attitudes toward generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in shaping engagement, particularly in the context of writing, remains underexplored. Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM), the present study employs latent profile analysis (LPA), a person-centered approach that identifies distinct profiles of EFL learners’ engagement in GenAI-assisted writing. A one-way ANOVA is subsequently conducted to examine whether students’ attitudes toward GenAI differed across these engagement profiles. In addition, semi-structured interviews are conducted to investigate university teachers’ perceptions of how GenAI can enhance students’ writing engagement. The LPA identifies three engagement profiles as high engagement (31.9 %), medium engagement (50.8 %), and low engagement (17.3 %). However, GenAI attitude did not show a significant relationship with writing engagement. Qualitative findings indicate that teachers are aware of GenAI’s potential in improving students’ behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, though few have actively integrated such tools into their teaching. This study offers new insights into the relationship between writing engagement and GenAI attitudes. It provides practical implications for students, instructors, and educational institutions seeking to implement GenAI technologies in English as a foreign language (EFL) learning and teaching.},

    abstract = {The application of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in second language education (L2) has recently drawn significant scholarly attention. Nonetheless, in the context of English as a foreign language (EFL), the fundamental dimensions of GenAI literacy and its psychometric properties remain poorly defined. Without clarifying the factor structures and dimensionality of GenAI literacy, EFL teachers face challenges in effectively leveraging GenAI in their teaching. To address this gap, our study aimed to develop and validate a GenAI literacy scale for the Chinese EFL context, involving 603 EFL teachers. Specifically, a tentative scale comprising 38 five-point Likert items was administered to participants. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the final scale was refined, evincing 32 items categorized into five dimensions: “GenAI Knowledge”, “GenAI Use”, “GenAI Evaluation”, “GenAI Design”, and “GenAI Ethics”. Moreover, statistical analysis also verified the scale's convergent validity and reliability in measuring the construct of GenAI literacy. We anticipate that this EFL teachers' GenAI literacy scale will guide teachers and teacher educators in enhancing GenAI capabilities for professional growth. It can also inspire them to innovate teaching with AI tools, thereby offering them fresh insights into GenAI literacy and its sub-components in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-integrated EFL education.},

Despite the growing acknowledgment of its use in entrepreneurial activities, this field lacks a robust theoretical framework and practical implementation. This study seeks to fill this gap by drawing on information behavior literature to explore the effect of GenAI across the entrepreneurial spectrum. By leveraging large language models and prompt engineering patterns, we examined how GenAI could generate accurate, relevant, and inspiring content through various interaction scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI significantly mitigates early-stage entrepreneurial information asymmetry and supports sophisticated problem-solving when coupled with appropriate domain knowledge and prompt engineering techniques. However, GenAI’s task complexity limits its use in late-stage entrepreneurial exploitation activities. Finally, this study provides insight into research avenues and practical applications.},

Using data collected between 2006 and 2018 in French national health databases for 521 052 men with PC and 1 827 345 men without PC, we evaluated current evidence regarding overall survival for men with PC according to statin and/or metformin use. The highest mortality was observed in PC patients exposed to both statins and metformin (hazard ratio [HR] 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.25–2.33). However, for patients whose first PC treatment was androgen deprivation therapy, a protective effect was observed for statin alone exposure (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.93) and combined statin and metformin exposure (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.85–0.87), whereas men with metformin exposure alone had higher mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03–1.11) in comparison to non-users. This protective effect of statins was not observed for PC patients treated with radical prostatectomy. The result was confirmed using causal analysis in a Bayesian network, followed by semantic elicitation using generative artificial intelligence that compiles web-based human knowledge and dedicated literature.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has become an integral part of our professional lives. Despite their transformative potential, many professionals remain cautious about using these tools for drafting and editing manuscripts. While it is reasonable for academic journals to request transparency regarding AI usage, fundamental reservations against employing generative AI (GenAI) are outdated. A useful analogy can be drawn from the film Hidden Figures, which depicts the arrival of IBM computers at NASA, eventually replacing human “computers” for manual calculations. Dorothy Vaughan, the supervisor of these human experts, anticipated the change and adapted proactively by teaching her team programming skills. Today, it is unthinkable for scientific calculations to be done without software, just as it will soon be unthinkable to draft professional texts without AI assistance. GenAI should be seen as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than replacing it. By handling mundane aspects of writing, it allows authors to focus on critical thinking and idea generation. Transparency in AI use fosters trust and maintains ethical standards. Authors are encouraged to use GenAI under supervision and disclose its use openly. This will not only improve manuscript quality but also help authors allocate more time to innovation and creative thinking. Embracing GenAI is not merely an option; it represents an essential evolution in the way we approach writing.},

    abstract = {The rapid integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into modern power systems introduces significant challenges in forecasting accuracy, grid stability, and energy optimization. Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), including architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformers, offers new capabilities to overcome data sparsity, nonlinearity, and uncertainty in renewable-dominant systems. This study aims to comprehensively review the emerging role of Gen-AI in improving solar and wind forecasting, load prediction, energy storage management, and smart grid optimization. Using a comparative and synthesis-based methodology, this review analyses findings from high-impact publications between 2023 and 2025. Results indicate that GAN-based models reduce root mean square error (RMSE) by 15–20 % in solar irradiance forecasting and significantly enhance spatial-temporal wind simulations. Time-series GAN-LSTM hybrids enhance demand forecasting accuracy under nonlinear conditions, while VAE-driven dispatch models achieve gains of 9–12 % in energy efficiency and curtailment reduction. The novelty of this review lies in mapping Gen-AI's integration with digital twins, federated learning, and AI–IoT frameworks, which enables the real-time, privacy-preserving optimisation of complex energy systems. The principal conclusion is that Gen-AI serves as a transformative tool to enhance system resilience, forecasting precision, and operational flexibility in renewable energy networks. For sustainable implementation, future developments must address challenges in model explainability, data privacy, and scalability. These findings support the journal’s scope by highlighting AI-driven advancements for the reliable, efficient, and sustainable transformation of energy systems.},

The AI platforms provide generative AI-related services to support users' professional development and gather feedback to enhance the service through experiential learning. However, comprehending large volumes of unstructured datasets in the form of customer reviews presents an increasingly serious challenge as the number of users on AI platforms grows over time. We employ advanced machine learning techniques-topic modelling and word2vec- to extract more accurate insights from unstructured data. We collect customer reviews from AI content-creation platforms from 2022 to 2024. By combining topic modelling and word2vec, we uncover valuable insights. Our analysis identifies eight key topics: Playground, Support Hub, Content Lab, Productivity, User Experience, Access, Business Assistant, and Remix. The topic of regression analysis reveals that Content Lab, User Experience, Business Assistant, and Remix are more favourable in terms of customer satisfaction scores. The word2vec analysis with negative sampling indicates that Access and Playground demonstrate better cohesion scores compared to other themes. Conversely, themes such as Content Lab, Productivity, and Business Assistant have lower cohesion scores, indicating weak clustering among words within these themes.

    abstract = {Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 prioritizes advances in healthcare to improve accessibility, improve medical services, and support people with disabilities. Despite the adoption of telemedicine and AI-driven healthcare solutions, disabled and elderly people continue to face challenges in accessing real-time medical services, receiving accurate diagnoses and independently navigate healthcare facilities. Current healthcare systems often struggle with delays, lack of personalization, and inefficiencies in medical data processing, limiting their effectiveness in providing inclusive and responsive healthcare. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AI-powered healthcare framework that integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). RLHF enables AI models to learn and adapt based on real-time user feedback, ensuring a personalized and interactive healthcare experience. Meanwhile, ANP optimizes decision-making processes, allowing for faster, more accurate medical service delivery by considering multiple healthcare factors. This combined approach improves remote consultations, intelligent diagnostics, and seamless real-time interactions, significantly improving accessibility to healthcare for disabled individuals. The proposed framework is evaluated against existing AI-driven healthcare models. Results demonstrate that the system outperforms traditional methods, providing a faster, more reliable, and patient-centered healthcare experience. By combining GAI, RLHF, and ANP, this research offers a practical solution to improve healthcare accessibility for disabled individuals, aligning with the goals of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.},

This mixed-methods exploratory study investigated how Chinese EAL students perceived and used GenAI, and how these attitudes and behaviors reflected their Critical Language Awareness (CLA). Survey data were collected from 320 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying in China and abroad, supplemented by in-depth semi-structured interviews with five volunteers. Quantitative findings revealed that, while participants valued GenAI for reducing language barriers and enhancing writing mechanics, they remained wary of issues related to originality, transparency, and ethical accountability. Qualitative analysis further illuminated participants' emerging CLA, evident in their negotiations of power (managing overreliance and misinformation), ideology (navigating dominant academic norms), and social justice (acknowledging cultural biases encoded in GenAI training data). Although students were primarily motivated by pragmatic benefits, such as improved grammar, structure, and efficiency, they also recognized GenAI's potential to perpetuate monolingual, Western-centric perspectives. These results underscore the need to embed CLA principles in GenAI-assisted pedagogy. By encouraging students to critically interrogate GenAI outputs, question linguistic hierarchies, and reflect on sociocultural contexts, educators can better leverage GenAI's affordances while fostering ethical, culturally responsive, and equitable writing practices.},

    abstract = {Background
Medical students often struggle to engage with and retain complex pharmacology topics during their preclinical education. Traditional teaching methods can lead to passive learning and poor long-term retention of critical concepts.
Objective
This study aims to enhance the teaching of clinical pharmacology in medical school by using a multimodal generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to create compelling, cinematic clinical narratives (CCNs).
Methods
We transformed a standard clinical case into an engaging, interactive multimedia experience called “Shattered Slippers.” This CCN used various genAI tools for content creation: GPT-4 for developing the storyline, Leonardo.ai and Stable Diffusion for generating images, Eleven Labs for creating audio narrations, and Suno for composing a theme song. The CCN integrated narrative styles and pop culture references to enhance student engagement. It was applied in teaching first-year medical students about immune system pharmacology. Student responses were assessed through the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia and examination performance. The target audience comprised first-year medical students (n=40), with 18 responding to the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia survey (n=18).
Results
The study revealed a marked preference for the genAI-enhanced CCNs over traditional teaching methods. Key findings include the majority of surveyed students preferring the CCN over traditional clinical cases (14/18), as well as high average scores for triggered situational interest (mean 4.58, SD 0.53), maintained interest (mean 4.40, SD 0.53), maintained-feeling interest (mean 4.38, SD 0.51), and maintained-value interest (mean 4.42, SD 0.54). Students achieved an average score of 88% on examination questions related to the CCN material, indicating successful learning and retention. Qualitative feedback highlighted increased engagement, improved recall, and appreciation for the narrative style and pop culture references.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential of using a multimodal genAI-driven approach to create CCNs in medical education. The “Shattered Slippers” case effectively enhanced student engagement and promoted knowledge retention in complex pharmacological topics. This innovative method suggests a novel direction for curriculum development that could improve learning outcomes and student satisfaction in medical education. Future research should explore the long-term retention of knowledge and the applicability of learned material in clinical settings, as well as the potential for broader implementation of this approach across various medical education contexts.},

    abstract = {Summary
The mRNA-based therapeutics, notably mRNA vaccines, represent a new era of powerful tools to combat various diseases. However, the relatively low translation efficiency of exogenous mRNA often limits its wide application. Here, we propose a computational framework called UTailoR (UTR tailor), which significantly improves the challenge by optimizing 5′ UTR sequences based on a two-step artificial intelligence strategy. We first develop a deep-learning-based discriminative model for predicting mRNA translation efficiency with 5′ UTR sequences and then present a generative model to generate optimized 5′ UTR sequences, which are designed to be highly close to the original sequences but predicted to result in high translation efficiency. The experimental results show that the UTailoR-optimized sequences outstrip the corresponding original sequences by ∼200%. This work provides an efficient and convenient method for mRNA 5′ UTR optimization, which can be easily accessed online.},

While digital storytelling (DST) has shown promise in fostering reflective practice, traditional methods often present technical barriers that hinder deeper reflection. Few studies have explored how generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools can support RTS during DST creation. This study addresses these gaps by adopting a three-dimensional framework of RTS, which included the time of reflection, objects of reflection, and levels of reflection, to guide and assess the impact of GAI-assisted DST creation on pre-service teachers' reflective patterns. Employing a post-test quasi-experimental design, eighty pre-service teachers were divided into two groups: an experimental group utilizing GAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney, Runway) for DST creation, and a control group utilizing traditional methods. Results revealed that the experimental group significantly improved RTS in time, objects, and levels of reflection. Pre-service teachers in the experimental group reflected more on problem definition and solution generation during the design stages of reflection time. Regarding reflection objects, the experimental group exhibited significantly higher reflection frequencies across self, artifacts, and circumstances aspects. Additionally, pre-service teachers in experimental group demonstrated significantly higher reflection frequencies at all levels—single-loop, double-loop, and triple-loop—compared to the control group. Single-loop reflection was the most common, while triple-loop reflection was the least frequent in both groups. These findings underline GAI's potential to scaffold RTS and enhance the DST creation process, offering valuable insights for integrating GAI into teacher education to foster deeper reflective practice.},

Employing a convergent mixed-methods research design, we designed and implemented a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-supported virtual simulation as a pedagogical sandbox for 40 preservice teachers (PSTs) to practice teaching with virtual students, interpret student resources, and act on these interpretations in real time. Linear regression analysis was conducted and found that PSTs’ in-the-moment interpretations are significant predictors of their responsive teaching talk moves and knowledge. Qualitative thematic analysis identified themes that corroborated and extended the findings of the quantitative component. Implications for teacher education and simulation design are discussed.},

    abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has exerted a greater influence on EFL learners' digital multimodal composing (DMC) process. GAI focuses on creating new textual and multimodal content using large language models (LLMs), and it puts different demands on EFL learners. Although much research has been conducted on EFL learners' AI literacy in various socio-cultural contexts, more attention should now be paid to EFL learners' GAI literacy in the DMC context, a new autonomous model of literacy. It should be noted that even though some studies may concentrate on users' perceptions and experiences with GAI, which may be closely tied to GAI literacy, there lacks the development of a scale for assessing GAI literacy in DMC. Thus, this study attempted to fill these research gaps by developing and validating an applicable and generalizable instrument to measure Chinese EFL learners' multimodal GAI literacy in their DMC process. Two subsamples (n1 = 296, n2 = 294) were randomly invited to respond to the GAIDMCS, and the data were subjected to exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test the validity and reliability of the instrument. The findings suggested that a four-factor solution with 17 items can help explain Chinese EFL learners’ GAI literacy in DMC in terms of affective learning, behavior learning, cognitive learning, and ethical learning. Our GAI literacy in DMC scale may help improve GAI education for researchers and practitioners by providing a comprehensive and plausible framework that can serve as an outline for further syllabus design.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This study investigates how entrepreneurship education influences e-entrepreneurial intention through e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy, with generative artificial intelligence incorporation as a moderating factor. The study uses the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) framework to comprehensively understand the relationship between educational, psychological and technological factors in fostering e-entrepreneurship among university students.
Design/methodology/approach
A quantitative study was conducted using survey data collected from 504 university students in Vietnam. The PROCESS macro was employed to test the mediating role of e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the moderating effect of generative artificial intelligence incorporation on the relationships among entrepreneurship education, e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intention.
Findings
The results demonstrate that entrepreneurship education significantly influences both e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy and intention. E-entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates the relationship between entrepreneurship education and intention. Generative artificial intelligence incorporation amplifies the effects of entrepreneurship education and e-entrepreneurial self-efficacy on intention, both directly and indirectly, highlighting its role as a transformative driver in e-entrepreneurship.
Practical implications
The findings suggest that integrating generative artificial intelligence tools and entrepreneurship-focused education into training programs can enhance students’ digital entrepreneurial skills. Policymakers and educators should develop strategies to foster digital literacy and entrepreneurial competence to prepare students for technology-driven business environments.
Originality/value
This study contributes to the literature by extending the stimulus-organism-response framework to e-entrepreneurship. It uniquely integrates educational, psychological and technological factors, offering new insights into the mechanisms that foster e-entrepreneurial intention in emerging markets.},

    abstract = {The beginnings of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), led by Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), not only change the behaviour of digital media ecosystem users but also increase the energy consumption of enterprises working with GenAI, which presents them with a fundamental challenge in the era of climate change. This study aims to examine the relationships between the selected aspects of the use of GenAI tools and the environmental perception and behaviour of their users to understand the population's current environmental attitudes towards environmental risks and environmental sustainability. The survey was conducted in October 2024 on a sample of 1,268 respondents of the Czech Republic population. To process the data set, a logistic regression analysis, chi-squared test, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion are employed. The results show that the more often people use GenAI tools, the more distant they consider the effects of climate change in time. The low frequency of use of ChatGPT may influence a higher willingness to change popular GenAI tools that are not maintained by environmentally friendly data centres. The frequency of ChatGPT use influences individuals’ perception of the importance of climate-change solving. The more frequently the respondents use artificial intelligence (AI) systems, they less perceive climate change as important. The low frequency of ChatGPT usage is associated with lower willingness to change email provider, transfer own data, leave social networks, stop using a favourite streaming platform and stop using a favourite GenAI platform. The respondents’ attitudes show a visible behavioural change. Internal personal motivation and self-confidence in learning, interest in career and self-confidence when using AI, the behavioural aspects, and the cognitive aspects are altered considerably. Based on the outcomes of the population survey, the study concludes that the issue of environmental friendliness of AI tools should become part of AI literacy that could strengthen population's willingness to use more energy-efficient GenAI platforms. The listed challenges are important in the perspective of the latest technological development, as shown by the discussion on the energy and computational demands of the GenAI platform DeepSeek, which is also discussed in the study.},

Yet even though the importance of visual content has exploded in recent years – driven by the ease through which consumers, influencers, and managers can create and share brand-related visuals thanks to social media and now generative artificial intelligence – comprehensive advice on how brand strategies can be visually executed has remained scarce. This article introduces the EPIC framework for translating nuanced brand meanings into concrete visual content. Integrating the literatures on visual storytelling, archetypes, and critical visual analysis, the framework details four interlocked steps to operationalize archetypes for visual storytelling: Defining the essence of the brand, personifying the brand essence into suitable archetypes, inflecting archetypes towards the brand via themes, and cataloguing visual elements into a SMART instrument to guide visual content creation in a bottom-up process. Brands that employ the EPIC framework can bridge the strategy-execution gap in visual storytelling and unlock two particular benefits: (1) a more consistently enacted archetypal gestalt, and (2) differentiation through more distinct and clearly composed images.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) may revolutionize health care, providing solutions that range from enhancing diagnostic accuracy to personalizing treatment plans. However, its rapid and largely unregulated integration into medicine raises ethical concerns related to data integrity, patient safety, and appropriate oversight. One of the primary ethical challenges lies in generative AI’s potential to produce misleading or fabricated information, posing risks of misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment recommendations, which underscore the necessity for robust physician oversight. Transparency also remains a critical concern, as the closed-source nature of many large-language models prevents both patients and health care providers from understanding the reasoning behind AI-generated outputs, potentially eroding trust. The lack of regulatory approval for AI as a medical device, combined with concerns around the security of patient-derived data and AI-generated synthetic data, further complicates its safe integration into clinical workflows. Furthermore, synthetic datasets generated by AI, although valuable for augmenting research in areas with scarce data, complicate questions of data ownership, patient consent, and scientific validity. In addition, generative AI’s ability to streamline administrative tasks risks depersonalizing care, further distancing providers from patients. These challenges compound the deeper issues plaguing the health care system, including the emphasis of volume and speed over value and expertise. The use of generative AI in medicine brings about mass scaling of synthetic information, thereby necessitating careful adoption to protect patient care and medical advancement. Given these considerations, generative AI applications warrant regulatory and critical scrutiny. Key starting points include establishing strict standards for data security and transparency, implementing oversight akin to institutional review boards to govern data usage, and developing interdisciplinary guidelines that involve developers, clinicians, and ethicists. By addressing these concerns, we can better align generative AI adoption with the core foundations of humanistic health care, preserving patient safety, autonomy, and trust while harnessing AI’s transformative potential.

AI-supported autonomy (AI-SA) moderates this relationship. We use two independent studies to test the proposed model: an experiment (Study 1) and a field survey study (Study 2). The research findings suggest that employees’ ethical perceptions of GAI use lead to moral rumination, which impairs their service innovative behavior and ethical voice behavior.

The Food and Drug Administration mandates patient labeling materials like the Medication Guide (MG) and Instructions for Use (IFU) to support appropriate medication use. However, challenges such as low health literacy and difficulties navigating these materials may lead to incorrect medication usage, resulting in therapy failure or adverse outcomes. The rise of generative AI, presents an opportunity to provide scalable, personalized patient education through image recognition and text generation.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of medication instructions generated by ChatGPT based on user-provided drug images, compared to the manufacturer's standard instructions.
Methods
Images of 12 medications requiring multiple steps for administration were uploaded to ChatGPT's image recognition function. ChatGPT's responses were compared to the official IFU and MG using text classifiers, Count Vectorization (CountVec), and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The clinical accuracy was further evaluated by independent pharmacists to determine if ChatGPT responses were valid for patient instruction.
Results
ChatGPT correctly identified all medications and generated patient instructions. CountVec outperformed TF-IDF in text similarity analysis, with an average similarity score of 76%. However, clinical evaluation revealed significant gaps in the instructions, particularly for complex administration routes, where ChatGPT's guidance lacked essential details, leading to lower clinical accuracy scores.
Conclusion
While ChatGPT shows promise in generating patient-friendly medication instructions, its effectiveness varies based on the complexity of the medication. The findings underscore the need for further refinement and clinical oversight to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI-generated medical guidance, particularly for medications with complex administration processes.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots may be useful tools for supporting shared prostate cancer (PrCA) screening decisions, but the information produced by these tools sometimes lack quality or credibility. “Prostate Cancer Info” is a custom GPT chatbot developed to provide plain-language PrCA information only from websites of key authorities on cancer and peer-reviewed literature.
Objective
The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and readability of Prostate Cancer Info’s responses to frequently asked PrCA screening questions.
Methods
A total of 23 frequently asked PrCA questions were individually input into Prostate Cancer Info. Responses were recorded in Microsoft Word and reviewed by 2 raters for their accuracy and completeness. Readability of content was determined by pasting responses into a web-based Flesch Kincaid Reading Ease Scores calculator.
Results
Responses to all questions were accurate and culturally appropriate. In total, 17 of the 23 questions (74%) had complete responses. The average readability of responses was 64.5 (SD 8.7; written at an 8th-grade level).
Conclusions
Generative AI chatbots, such as Prostate Cancer Info, are great starting places for learning about PrCA screening and preparing men to engage in shared decision-making but should not be used as independent sources of PrCA information because key information may be omitted. Men are encouraged to use these tools to complement information received from a health care provider.},

    abstract = {Background
The global shortage of mental health professionals, exacerbated by increasing mental health needs post COVID-19, has stimulated growing interest in leveraging large language models to address these challenges.
Objectives
This systematic review aims to evaluate the current capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models in the context of mental health applications.
Methods
A comprehensive search across 5 databases yielded 1046 references, of which 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. The included studies were original research with experimental designs (eg, Turing tests, sociocognitive tasks, trials, or qualitative methods); a focus on GenAI models; and explicit measurement of sociocognitive abilities (eg, empathy and emotional awareness), mental health outcomes, and user experience (eg, perceived trust and empathy).
Results
The studies, published between 2023 and 2024, primarily evaluated models such as ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0, Bard, and Claude in tasks such as psychoeducation, diagnosis, emotional awareness, and clinical interventions. Most studies used zero-shot prompting and human evaluators to assess the AI responses, using standardized rating scales or qualitative analysis. However, these methods were often insufficient to fully capture the complexity of GenAI capabilities. The reliance on single-shot prompting techniques, limited comparisons, and task-based assessments isolated from a context may oversimplify GenAI’s abilities and overlook the nuances of human–artificial intelligence interaction, especially in clinical applications that require contextual reasoning and cultural sensitivity. The findings suggest that while GenAI models demonstrate strengths in psychoeducation and emotional awareness, their diagnostic accuracy, cultural competence, and ability to engage users emotionally remain limited. Users frequently reported concerns about trustworthiness, accuracy, and the lack of emotional engagement.
Conclusions
Future research could use more sophisticated evaluation methods, such as few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting to fully uncover GenAI’s potential. Longitudinal studies and broader comparisons with human benchmarks are needed to explore the effects of GenAI-integrated mental health care.},

However, inconsistent product quality complicates user decisions, jeopardizing both the sustainability of GAI technologies and their broader adoption. To address these challenges, this study proposes a user-centered evaluation framework that integrates fuzzy social networks with advanced multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches. Grounded theory is first employed to establish a ''marketing-information-product-individual'' system of factors influencing GAI product adoption. Next, fuzzy social networks reduce semantic ambiguity and mitigate expert bias, while the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method uncovers causal relationships among these factors. The DEMATEL-based Analytic Network Process (DANP) then quantifies the relative importance of each factor, followed by a modified VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to comprehensively evaluate representative GAI products. The findings reveal that product maturity exerts the strongest driving force, whereas perceived effect experiences the highest overall impact. Information reliability and the individual dimension carry the greatest weights. Moreover, current products display notable deficiencies in risk management, user service, and ease of use, all of which warrant developers' attention to enhance user satisfaction and adoption. In light of these results, the study proposes targeted optimization strategies for four distinct GAI products.

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is transforming health care in a variety of ways; however, the present utility of GAI for supporting clinicians who treat rare disease such as primary immune disorders (PIs) is not well studied. We evaluated the ability of 6 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for providing clinical guidance about PIs.
Objective
To quantitatively and qualitatively measure the utility of current, open-source LLMs for diagnosing and providing helpful clinical decision support about PIs.
Methods
Five expert clinical immunologists each provided 5 real-world, anonymized PI case vignettes via multi-turn prompting to 6 LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1). We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the LLMs and the quality of clinical reasoning using the Revised-IDEA (R-IDEA) score. Qualitative LLM assessment was made by immunologist narratives.
Results
Performance accuracy (>88%) and R-IDEA scores (≥8) were superior for 3 models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407), with GPT-4o achieving the highest diagnostic accuracy (96.2%). Conversely, the remaining 3 models fell below acceptable accuracy rates near 60% or lower and had poor R-IDEA scores (≤0.55), with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 attaining the worst diagnostic accuracy (42.3%). Compared with the 3 best-performing LLMs, the 3 worst-performing LLMs had a substantially lower median R-IDEA score (P < .001). Interclass correlation coefficient for R-IDEA score assignments varied substantially by LLM, ranging from good to poor agreement, and did not appear to correlate with either diagnostic accuracy or median R-IDEA score. Qualitatively, immunologists identified several themes (eg, correctness, differential diagnosis appropriateness, relative conciseness of explanations) of relevance to PIs.
Conclusions
LLM can support diagnosis and management of PIs; however, further tuning is needed to optimize LLMs for best practice recommendations.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is expected to enhance the productivity of the public social and health care sector while maintaining, at minimum, current standards of quality and user experience. However, empirical evidence on GAI impacts in practical, real-life settings remains limited.
Objective
This study investigates productivity, machine translation quality, and user experience impacts of the GPT-4 language model in an in-house language translation services team of a large well-being services county in Finland.
Methods
A mixed methods study was conducted with 4 in-house translators between March and June 2024. Quantitative data of 908 translation segments were collected in real-life conditions using the computer-assisted language translation software Trados (RWS) to assess productivity differences between machine and human translation. Quality was measured using 4 automatic metrics (human-targeted translation edit rate, Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering, and Character n-gram F-score) applied to 1373 GAI-human segment pairs. User experience was investigated through 5 semistructured interviews, including the team supervisor.
Results
The findings indicate that, on average, postediting machine translation is 14% faster than translating texts from scratch (2.75 vs 2.40 characters per second, P=.03), and up to 37% faster when the number of segments is equalized across translators. However, productivity varied notably between individuals, with improvements ranging from −2% to 102%. Regarding translation quality, 11% (141/1261) of Finnish-Swedish and 16% (18/112) of Finnish-English GAI outputs were accepted without edits. Average human-targeted translation edit rate scores were 55 (Swedish) and 46 (English), indicating that approximately half of the words required editing. Bilingual Evaluation Understudy scores averaged 43 for Swedish and 38 for English, suggesting good translation quality. Metric for Evaluation of Translation With Explicit Ordering and Character n-gram F-scores reached 63 and 68 for Swedish and 59 and 57 for English, respectively. All metrics have been converted to an equivalent scale from 0 to 100, with 100 reflecting a perfect match. Interviewed translators expressed mixed reviews on productivity gains but generally perceived value in using GAI, especially for repetitive, generic content. Identified challenges included inconsistent or incorrect terminology, lack of document-level context, and limited system customization.
Conclusions
Based on this case study, GPT-4–based GAI shows measurable potential to enhance translation productivity and quality within an in-house translation team in the public social and health care sector. However, its effectiveness appears to be influenced by factors, such as translator postediting skills, workflow design, and organizational readiness. These findings suggest that, in similar contexts, public social and health care organizations could benefit from investing in translator training, optimizing technical integration, redesigning workflows, and implementing effective change management. Future research should examine larger translator teams to assess the generalizability of these results and further explore how translation quality and user experience can be improved through domain-specific customization.},

    abstract = {Background
The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming health care globally. In China, hospitals are rapidly embracing digital transformation. Senior leaders are pivotal in influencing and deciding the adoption of GenAI technologies in professional settings. However, evidence on their perceptions and attitudes and how they evolve over time is lacking.
Objective
This study aims to investigate senior Chinese hospital leaders’ perceptions relating to GenAI and their attitudes toward adopting GenAI technologies in professional settings and to document how their perspectives evolve.
Methods
A longitudinal, descriptive qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach. Senior leaders, including hospital directors/deputies and department heads/deputies, from 3 tertiary hospitals across the Hebei, Guangdong, and Sichuan provinces were purposively sampled. Data were collected through semistructured telephone interviews at two time points (baseline and 6 months later). Interview transcriptions were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method to extract themes related to knowledge acquisition, attitudinal shifts, and evolving barriers and facilitators to GenAI adoption.
Results
A total of 32 participants were interviewed in August 2024 and February 2025, including 11 (34.4%) participants from Hebei, 12 (37.5%) from Sichuan, and 9 (28.1%) from Guangdong. Their roles included 8 (25%) hospital directors/deputies and 24 (75%) department heads/deputies. The analysis of the interview transcriptions revealed three primary themes. First, participants’ understanding of GenAI improved markedly over time as they engaged with diverse information sources and gained practical experience. Second, despite widespread support for personal use, senior leaders shifted from initial reluctance to formal institutional adoption. Third, initial obstacles, such as limited technical literacy and resource constraint concerns, diminished over time, while new drivers, including peer influence and technological breakthroughs such as DeepSeek, emerged to catalyze adoption.
Conclusions
Senior Chinese hospital leaders’ perceptions and attitudes toward GenAI have evolved significantly over time. Improved knowledge through diverse information channels has enhanced their comprehension and shifted their stance from cautious personal experimentation toward formal institutional adoption. The dynamic interplay between diminishing obstacles and emerging catalysts, notably the influence of peer practices and technological breakthroughs such as DeepSeek, underscores the potential for transformative change in health care management. Targeted educational initiatives, pilot projects, and robust policy frameworks are needed to facilitate GenAI integration.},

Nevertheless, most studies have investigated the impacts of GenAI on learners' final written outputs instead of their writing processes. To fill this research gap, we examined EFL learners' self-efficacy and writing self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, which were essential motivational constructs underlying GenAI-assisted writing processes. Our person-centered latent profile analysis of 193 EFL learners revealed four groups of students with diverse GenAI-assisted writing self-efficacy levels: highly confident all-rounders, practical assistance seekers, interaction-oriented communicators, and unconfident less-adaptable users. These four profiles were found to be closely tied to their writing SRL strategy use. Furthermore, years of English learning experience and perceived English proficiency seemed to be significant antecedents of EFL learners’ GenAI-assisted writing self-efficacy profiles. These findings could chart new ways for EFL writing syllabus design in the GenAI context.},

Antecedentes y objetivo
La inteligencia artificial generativa es una tecnología que ofrece su mayor conectividad con las personas gracias a los bots conversacionales («chatbot»). Estos pueden mantener un diálogo con un lenguaje natural indistinguible del humano y son una fuente potencial de información para los pacientes. El objetivo de este trabajo es estudiar el rendimiento de estos bots en la resolución de cuestiones específicas de cirugía ortopédica y traumatología empleando las preguntas del examen MIR español entre 2008 y 2023.
Material y métodos
Se analizaron 3 modelos de «chatbots» (ChatGPT, Bard y Perplexity) respondiendo a 114 preguntas del MIR. Se compararon aciertos, se valoró la legibilidad de las respuestas y se examinó su dependencia con el razonamiento lógico y la información interna y externa. En los fallos también se evaluó el tipo de error.
Resultados
ChatGPT obtuvo un 72,81% de aciertos, seguido por Perplexity (67,54%) y Bard (60,53%). Las respuestas más legibles y completas las ofrece Bard. Las respuestas demostraron un razonamiento lógico y el uso de información interna de los enunciados de preguntas. En 16 preguntas (14%) las 3 aplicaciones fallaron simultáneamente. Se identificaron errores, que incluían fallos lógicos y de información.
Conclusiones
Aunque los bots conversacionales pueden ser útiles en la resolución de preguntas médicas, se señala la necesidad de precaución debido a la posibilidad de errores. Actualmente deben considerarse como una herramienta en desarrollo y la opinión humana debe prevalecer sobre la inteligencia artificial generativa.
Introduction
Generative Artificial Intelligence is a technology that provides greater connectivity with people through conversational bots («chatbots»). These bots can engage in dialogue using natural language indistinguishable from humans and are a potential source of information for patients.The aim of this study is to examine the performance of these bots in solving specific issues related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology using questions from the Spanish MIR exam between 2008 and 2023.
Material and methods
Three «chatbot» models (ChatGPT, Bard and Perplexity) were analyzed by answering 114 questions from the MIR. Their accuracy was compared, the readability of their responses was evaluated, and their dependence on logical reasoning and internal and external information was examined. The type of error was also evaluated in the failures.
Results
ChatGPT obtained 72.81% correct answers, followed by Perplexity (67.54%) and Bard (60.53%).Bard provides the most readable and comprehensive responses. The responses demonstrated logical reasoning and the use of internal information from the question prompts. In 16 questions (14%), all 3 applications failed simultaneously. Errors were identified, including logical and information failures.
Conclusions
While conversational bots can be useful in resolving medical questions, caution is advised due to the possibility of errors. Currently, they should be considered as a developing tool, and human opinion should prevail over Generative Artificial Intelligence.},

    abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, driven by advanced machine learning algorithms, are emerging as transformative tools for enhancing patient education, information dissemination, and counseling (EIC) in healthcare. This study investigated the psychological determinants of community pharmacists' intentions to adopt GenAI chatbots using the Extended Technology Acceptance Model (ETAM). A cross-sectional survey of 240 licensed community pharmacists across several Indonesian provinces assessed key constructs, including self-efficacy (SE), perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), attitude toward technology (ATT), trust (TT), and behavioral intention (BI). Structural equation modeling revealed that SE significantly influenced PU (β=0.37) and PEU (β=0.57), indicating that confidence in using technology positively affects perceived utility and usability. PU further predicted ATT (β=0.39) and BI (β=0.236), emphasizing the motivational role of perceived benefits. Trust emerged as a crucial mediator, channeling favorable attitudes into actionable behavioral intentions (indirect β=0.148). The model demonstrated strong fit indices (χ2=263.09, RMSEA = 0.019, GFI = 0.915, CFI = 0.991), supporting the psychological framework. These findings highlight the importance of fostering trust, improving perceived usability, and enhancing self-efficacy through targeted training to promote GenAI chatbot adoption. Future research should explore longitudinal behavioral changes and contextual influences to support sustainable AI integration in pharmacy practice.},

This study investigates the inclusive collaborative learning framework for enhancing STEM teaching among student teachers, focusing on interpersonal and human-machine (generative artificial intelligence) collaboration. Employing a Self-Determination Theory guided approach, two rounds of exploratory studies were conducted. Study 1 compared the effects of interpersonal collaboration (TSPL: in-Service Teacher-Student Teacher Pair Learning) and human-machine collaboration (CSPL: ChatGPT-Student Teacher Pair Learning). Building on Study 1, Study 2 employed a hybrid inclusive collaborative learning model (iHMCL: integrated Human-Machine Collaborative Learning) with expanded participant demographics, blended course formats, and integrated peer, expert, and AI feedback mechanisms. The two-year iterative empirical research revealed differences in the impact of the three collaborative learning approaches on student teachers' learning. CSPL and iHMCL groups outperformed TSPL in STEM teaching knowledge and cognitive load, while TSPL and iHMCL excelled in STEM teaching ability compared to CSPL. The SDT-based inclusive collaborative learning framework for STEM teacher training proved effective, with noted implications. In the future, the integration of generative artificial intelligence and cross boundary learning in inclusive STEM teacher education will require educators to redefine their roles, emphasizing emotional support, critical thinking, and creativity, ensuring that AI complements rather than replaces hands-on, reality-based learning.},

This study explores how English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writers engage with ChatGPT feedback by analyzing their revision behaviors and perceptions of its effectiveness in revising their opinion essays. Using a convergent parallel mixed methods design, the study involved 25 B1-level EFL students from a university in Türkiye. Data were collected through essay drafts, change tracker sheets, a questionnaire, and interviews. The descriptive and thematic analysis of essays, change tracker sheets, and interviews revealed that most content and language feedback was accepted, while organization feedback received mixed engagement of acceptance and rejection. Students were more likely to accept language use feedback than content or organization feedback, often incorporating ChatGPT's revisions directly. For content feedback, the most common revision operations were additions and substitutions while more than a third of the revisions in response to organization feedback involved no corrections. Correction was the most frequent revision operation for language use feedback. Questionnaire and interview analyses further revealed that while ChatGPT feedback was generally well-received and considered beneficial for writing improvement, students faced challenges related to feedback length, specificity, advanced language, and misunderstandings. This study provides valuable insights into how EFL students interact with ChatGPT-generated feedback, highlighting both its potential to support L2 writing development and the challenges that may limit its effectiveness.},

    abstract = {Background
Health care chatbots can be used to support patients and their families with everyday decision-making. While there is some research on integrating artificial intelligence into pediatric care, no study has focused on the opportunity of implementing a generative artificial intelligence chatbot for pediatric rheumatology. Pediatric rheumatology conditions require intense family input, which can often leave families struggling to navigate disease flares, pain, fatigue, medication side effects and adherence, and support of their child, often when pediatric rheumatology departments are shut. Understanding how we can support families better, without the need for increased personnel, will have implications for the health care systems.
Objective
The study aimed to explore parental and children and young people’s acceptance of chatbot use in a pediatric context, and understand how a chatbot could be specifically used for managing a child’s chronic health condition.
Methods
This study was a mixed methods design, using both a family workshop and a subsequent questionnaire.
Results
In total, 22 participants contributed to the qualitative design using the world café methodology at a workshop, and 47 participants (36 parents and 11 children and young people) completed quantitative data via a questionnaire. Participants expressed their likelihood of using chatbot technology, including ChatGPT, due to its accessibility. However, participants had significantly greater intention (parents: P<.001; children and young people: P=.006) to use a specific chatbot over ChatGPT, due to increased trust, credibility, and specificity in design. Children and young people and parents should be distinguished as 2 user groups in chatbot design, reflecting their specific needs in chatbot features and personalization.
Conclusions
Overall, the study reinforced the need for a specialized and trusted chatbot designed with input from health professionals to assist families in managing complex chronic health conditions to support families in between appointments and complement existing face-to-face care. Future research should evaluate users’ engagement with a functional prototype to investigate its usefulness and explore its implementation into families’ everyday lives. Importantly, the current findings have broader implications for the field of pediatric health care, as similarly tailored chatbot interventions could benefit families who are managing other chronic health conditions.},

Although research on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has expanded rapidly, limited attention has been given to students’ GenAI literacy in English as a foreign language learning, particularly from a process-oriented perspective. To address this gap, a process-oriented analytical framework was proposed and applied to examine Chinese university students’ GenAI literacy in English as a foreign language learning. The analysis drew on three datasets from the same cohort of 144 students: focus group transcripts, GenAI usage reports from a video presentation project, and presentation scripts developed with GenAI support. The findings reveal dual challenges in students’ GenAI literacy: a tendency to underutilize advanced functionalities while over-relying on GenAI for basic tasks. Additionally, the results underscore the significant influence of contextual factors in shaping student–GenAI interactions. Theoretical and pedagogical implications of these findings are discussed.},

    abstract = {The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming accounting practices and education. This study provides descriptive evidence regarding how accounting students currently engage with AI tools in their learning experience. Survey data from 259 accounting students and 126 non-accounting students at a four-year public university in the U.S. reveals that 80 % of students use AI at least about once a week or more, primarily for help with difficult concepts. Students introduced to AI from their peers and friends feel more encouraged to use it than the rest of the students. While accounting and non-accounting students share many similar usage patterns, accounting students are less likely to use AI for creativity tasks or to accept AI-generated outputs without questioning their accuracy, bias, or currency, especially when it comes to decision making. Among the accounting disciplines, students are more likely to use AI for AIS. Both accounting and non-accounting students believe AI is able to reduce repetitive tasks and perceive AI with a positive impact on their learning experience, including improving GPA, helping with knowledge acquisition, making learning more enjoyable, and saving learning time. Such perceived benefits do vary by usage frequency and student GPA. This study highlights the importance of incorporating AI into accounting education to enhance student learning experience. It complements prior research focusing on educators and professionals, offering insights from students’ perspectives.},

Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, including surveys and interviews, this research explored students’ experiences and perceptions of GenAI tools, including Grammarly and Quillbot. The findings revealed that two-thirds of the students (66.7%) regularly used these tools, which they found particularly helpful for improving grammar, writing, vocabulary, and reading skills. Interview insights indicated that the students appreciated the personalised feedback and creative support provided by GenAI tools, although they also acknowledged risks such as irrelevant feedback and potential overreliance. We suggest that while GenAI tools enhance language learning by providing personalised and adaptive support, they should complement rather than replace traditional methods.

    abstract = {The purpose of the study is to examine the role of cognitive flexibility, digital competencies and self-regulation skills in reducing university students' artificial intelligence (AI) anxiety. The study proposes that it isn't possible to harness the potential benefits of AI technologies unless students' concerns about these technologies are suitably addressed. Although the number of potential benefits specifically related to the use of AI in education is enormous, addressing students' concerns about AI is essential to ensure the effective use of these technologies in education. The correlational survey model was used in this study. Four well-established instruments were employed to collect data from students who studied in different public university faculties in Turkey. Participants were selected from students who had been using AI tools for educational purposes for at least six months. The findings showed that cognitive flexibility, digital competencies and self-regulation skills impact on AI anxiety. Students with high cognitive flexibility had lower AI anxiety, while students with high digital competencies were better able to comprehend and use AI technologies. In addition, students with high self-regulation skills were able to manage their own learning processes more effectively and experienced less anxiety in using AI. As a result, increasing university students' digital competencies and self-regulation skills can be influential in reducing their AI anxiety. Accordingly, educational institutions could offer programs to develop students' digital competencies and AI literacy. These programs can help them adapt to AI technologies more easily and reduce their anxiety about these technologies by teaching students how to use AI technologies effectively and efficiently.},

The aim of this study was to explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in geriatric nursing classes for the design of older adult activities to educate students on how to pose clear questions, provide and identify potentially suitable daily activities for older adults.
Background
Researchers in various educational fields are increasingly employing GenAI tools such as ChatGPT for curriculum development and research. Question generation is an essential skill for all students to learn to acquire knowledge. However, there is limited experimental evidence on teaching students to correctly use GenAI for assisting with question generation ability and empirical data related to improving students' capacity for solving complex problems remains scarce.
Design
A mixed-method study design with both quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Methods
This study investigated the effectiveness of a GenAI-guided prompt-based learning approach implemented in a geriatric nursing class for first-year undergraduate students, involving a cohort of 56 participants.
Results
Experimental results indicated that the GenAI-guided prompt-based learning approach significantly enhanced students' critical thinking, metacognition and problem-solving tendencies and their question generation via prompts performance. Moreover, participants who engaged in the GenAI-guided prompt-based learning approach found the tasks easier to complete and required less cognitive effort.
Conclusions
Nursing students using the GenAI-guided prompt-based learning approach outperformed the control group in cognitive network analysis dimensions of clarity, relevance, complexity, precision and engagement. Thus, integrating GenAI prompts into course activities can effectively improve student learning outcomes, reduce metacognitive load and assist in solving learning problems.},

Drawing on systems theory, this study proposes a conceptual framework to examine the relationships among integration effort, compatibility, synergy, and value creation. Data from 531 AI image creators supported our hypotheses, revealing that: (1) integration effort significantly enhances both compatibility and synergy; (2) compatibility positively influences synergy; (3) synergy directly and positively impacts user value creation; and (4) synergy serves as a critical mediator in the relationships between the two enablers—compatibility and integration effort—and user value creation, with compatibility also partially mediating the link between integration effort and synergy. These results extend systems theory by integrating it more deeply with the resource-based view and highlighting synergy as a pivotal factor that not only directly drives user value creation but also mediates the effects of compatibility and integration effort. Furthermore, the study empirically confirms that user value can be conceptualized through three key constructs: efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.},

The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into creative tasks offers strong potential to enhance team creativity and collaborative competence. However, the factors shaping attitudes and behavioral intentions toward GenAI in creative collaboration have received limited attention, particularly in cross-cultural contexts. To address these gaps, this study has developed and validated an integrated theoretical framework via a hybrid multistage approach. First, focus group interviews (N = 15) informed the extension of the TAM-TPB model by incorporating perceived risk, openness to experience, and AI literacy. Then, cross-cultural survey data from China (N = 529) and the USA (N = 544) were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), multi-group analysis (MGA), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Results showed that subjective norm influenced user attitudes in both countries. In China, perceived usefulness and risk were key predictors, whereas in the USA, ease of use and openness to experience were more influential. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control were found to be critical determinants of behavioral intentions across both groups. By integrating perspectives from creativity research, this study provides theoretical and practical implications for the adoption of GenAI in creative domains, informing educators, industry practitioners, and technology developers.},

    abstract = {Faking—deliberately self-presenting in an overly favorable light—is a persistent challenge for personality assessments in high-stakes contexts such as personnel selection. This review examines recent research on the impact of faking, strategies for its prevention and detection, and future directions. Meta-analytic evidence supports the theory of validity declines from faking, but meaningful predictive utility remains. Research on prevention has grown, covering approaches such as forced-choice formats, neutralized items, warnings, gamified, and implicit measures. However, many methods involve practical or psychometric trade-offs. Although the literature is substantial, we encourage research involving larger samples, real applicants, and within-subjects designs. Finally, novel assessment methods, including those using generative artificial intelligence, warrant further investigation both as potential solutions and as tools for faking.},

Through exploratory interviews, we find that customers can feel grounded in ALSC. Such feelings can be primarily affected by VI characteristics and customer characteristics, which can also affect customers’ purchase motivations. The findings contribute to the ALSC literature by examining the emotional motivations of groundedness in customers’ purchase decisions, in contrast to the existing cognitive focus.The findings also extend the groundedness theory by identifying new sources, contextualized antecedents, and dark sides of groundedness. Additionally, the findings contribute to the VI literature by demonstrating that VIs in ALSC can unexpectedly create engaging customer experiences, which contrasts with the existing notion that customers view VIs as inauthentic and less engaging.},

The study examines the efficacy of PO-PBL in developing both technical proficiency and essential professional skills among students. Using a mixed methods approach, the research analyzes data from four consecutive semesters, encompassing student surveys, performance metrics, and qualitative feedback. The integration of the Integrated Product and Process Design (DIPP) methodology, gamification elements, and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools are explored as complementary strategies to improve learning outcomes. The results indicate sustained or improved technical skills throughout the semesters, coupled with significant improvements in student engagement, motivation, and professional competencies, particularly in communication and teamwork. The implementation of GenAI tools, guided by the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS), shows promising improvements in students’ research capabilities and writing skills. Although challenges in implementation are acknowledged, the POU course emerges as a promising model for chemical engineering education, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. This study provides valuable information on innovative pedagogical approaches that prepare students for the evolving demands of the chemical engineering industry.},

    abstract = {Background
Exercise cardiovascular magnetic resonance (Ex-CMR) can reveal pathophysiologies not evident at rest by quantifying biventricular volume and function during or immediately after exercise. However, achieving reproducible Ex-CMR measurements is challenging due to limited spatial and temporal resolution. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a free-breathing, high-spatiotemporal-resolution single-beat Ex-CMR cine enhanced by generative artificial intelligence. We assessed image analysis reproducibility, scan-rescan reproducibility, and impact of the reader's experience on the analysis.
Methods
Imaging was performed on a 3T CMR system using a free-breathing, highly accelerated, multi-slice, single-beat cine sequence (in-plane spatiotemporal resolution of 1.9 × 1.9 mm² and 37 ms, respectively). High acceleration was achieved by combining compressed sensing reconstruction with a resolution-enhancement generative adversarial inline neural network. Ex-CMR was performed using a supine ergometer positioned immediately outside the magnet bore. Single-beat cine images were acquired at rest and immediately post-exercise. In a prospective study, the protocol was evaluated in 141 subjects. A structured image analysis workflow was implemented. Four expert readers, with or without prior training in single-beat Ex-CMR, independently rated all images for diagnostic and image quality. The subjective assessment used two 3-point Likert scales. Biventricular parameters were calculated. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility were assessed. Fifteen healthy subjects were re-imaged 1 year later for scan-rescan reproducibility. Reproducibility was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), with agreement evaluated via Bland-Altman analysis, linear regression, and Pearson correlation.
Results
Free-breathing, single-beat Ex-CMR cine enabled imaging of the beating heart within 30 ± 6 s, with technically successful scans in 96% (136/141) of subjects. Post-exercise single-beat cine images were assessed as diagnostic in 98% (133/136), 96% (131/136), 82% (112/136), and 65% (89/136) of cases by four readers (ordered by descending years of Ex-CMR experience). Good image quality was reported in 74% (100/136) to 80% (109/136) of subjects. Biventricular parameters were successfully measured in all subjects, demonstrating good to excellent inter-observer reproducibility. Scan/rescan reproducibility over 1 year, assessed by two independent readers, showed excellent inter-visit ICCs (0.96–1.0) and strong correlations (R² ≥ 0.92, p < 0.001 for left ventricle; R² ≥ 0.95, p < 0.001 for right ventricle).
Conclusion
Single-beat Ex-CMR enabled evaluation of biventricular volumetric and functional indices with excellent reproducibility.},

This study introduces two variations of EmotionPrompt strategies, drawing on regulatory focus theory, to explore both individuals' perceptions of GAI ability and their empowerment in self-competence when handling disagreements. An experiment between humans and GAI chatbots in determining product promotion strategy showed that emotional prompts impact individuals' reappraisals of both chatbots and their own performance profoundly, cultivating self-determination in the final decision. Importantly, EmotionPrompt with promotion orientation can increase the perceived flexibility of chatbot decision-makers, facilitating individual self-enhancement and trust in GAI competence. In contrast, the prevention-oriented EmotionPrompt appears to constrain individuals' judgments and decision-making processes, as evidenced by the increased occurrence of inhibit words and anxiety emotions in their reflections. These findings provide novel perspectives on implementing specific regulatory-oriented EmotionPrompt strategies in GAI to address opinion conflicts in decision-making with humans.},

This study aims to investigate antecedents, behavioral consequences, and boundary conditions of GAI identity threat. We conduct a two-phase study using a mixed-methods approach. The qualitative phase aims to identify the critical factors that influence GAI identity threat. After coding 30 semi-structured interview transcripts, we find that GAI's high intelligence and human-like abilities facilitate three kinds of affordance that influence GAI identity threat: creative affordance, analysis affordance, and communication affordance. The quantitative phase, based on IT identity threat theory, constructs a research model to examine how the three types of affordance influence GAI identity threat, as well as identifying the behavioral consequences. An examination of survey data from 405 users indicates that GAI's creative affordance, analysis affordance, and communication affordance are associated with GAI identity threat, which may lead to users’ resistance behavior. Furthermore, GAI autonomy and user self-identity moderate the relationship between GAI affordances and GAI identity threat, respectively. This study identifies users’ negative psychological mechanisms when using AI, develops IT identity threat theory in the context of GAI, and provides implications for practitioners to reduce identity threats.},

    abstract = {Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks enable high data rates, low latency, and massive machine communications, driving digital transformation across sectors. The integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies plays a vital role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of B5G networks. However, the dynamic and ever-evolving service demands associated with B5G use cases lead to the occurrence of drift, which can significantly degrade the performance of AI/ML models. Drift occurrence often results in violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and over- or under-provisioning of resources, ultimately impacting user experience and network reliability. Drift detection and adaptation are essential for addressing the dynamic service demands of B5G networks. Existing threshold approach and various other frameworks, have significant limitations, — SLA violations from delayed drift detection and inefficient resource management due to frequent retraining. This paper proposes a drift handling framework that determines drift promptly after its occurrence using Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI). The proposed Gen-AI framework is evaluated for a Quality of Service Prediction use case on the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Software Community (OSC) platform and compared to the existing threshold and other frameworks. Also, a real-time dataset from the Colosseum testbed is considered to evaluate the Network Slicing (NS) use case with the proposed Gen-AI framework for drift handling. The results demonstrate that the proposed Gen-AI framework leverages both Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), significantly enhances drift detection and adaptation time in B5G networks. Specifically, in the QoS prediction use case, GAN achieves 98% drift detection accuracy, while the VAE achieves 95% , compared to 85% for the classifier framework, 25% for the threshold-based approach. In addition, a similar kind of results is observed in case of the network slicing use case. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Gen-AI framework in proactively handling drift with reduced detection and adaptation time, making it a promising solution for B5G networks.},

    abstract = {Background
Since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have attracted significant attention in various fields, including surgery. These advancements have been particularly notable for creating highly detailed and contextually accurate images from textual prompts. A notable area of clinical application is the representation of surgeon demographics in various specialties, particularly in the context of microsurgery and plastic surgery-related subspecialties.
Methods
This cross-sectional study, conducted in June 2024, utilized the latest version of the Copilot Creative Mode powered by DALL-E 3 to generate images of surgeons across various plastic surgery subspecialties. Real-world demographic data from the US, Japan, and Zambia were compared with AI-generated images for an accurate representation analysis.
Results
Five hundred images (350 from various subspecialties and 150 from geographical sources) were analyzed. The AI model predominantly generated images of male and female surgeons with a statistical underrepresentation of female and Black microsurgeons. Geographical prompts influenced the representation, with an overrepresentation of female (64.0 %; p < 0.001) and Black (16.0 %; p < 0.001) plastic surgeons in the US and exclusively Asian surgeons in Japan. Discrepancies were also observed in the depiction of surgical equipment, with the majority of AI-generated microsurgeons inaccurately portrayed using either surgical loupes (46.0 %) or optical microscopes (32.0 %), not with surgical microscopes (4.0 %).
Conclusions
This study revealed significant disparities between AI-generated images and actual demographics in the fields of microsurgery and plastic surgery-related subspecialties, highlighting the need for more diverse and accurate training datasets for AI models.},

    abstract = {Introduction
In Australia, almost 50 % of paramedics are female yet they remain under-represented in stereotypical depictions of the profession. The potentially transformative value of generative artificial intelligence (AI) may be limited by stereotypical errors, misrepresentations and bias. Increasing use of text-to-image generative AI, like DALL-E 3, could reinforce gender and ethnicity biases and, therefore, is important to objectively evaluate.
Method
In March 2024, DALL-E 3 was utilised via GPT-4 to generate a series of individual and group images of Australian paramedics, ambulance officers, police officers and firefighters. In total, 82 images were produced including 60 individual-character images, and 22 multiple-character group images. All 326 depicted characters were independently analysed by three reviewers for apparent gender, age, skin tone and ethnicity.
Results
Among first responders, 90.8 % (N = 296) were depicted as male, 90.5 % (N = 295) as Caucasian, 95.7 % (N = 312) as a light skin tone, and 94.8 % (N = 309) as under 55 years of age. For paramedics and police the gender distribution was a statistically significant variation from that of actual Australian workforce data (all p < 0.001). Among the images of individual paramedics and ambulance officers (N = 32), DALL-E 3 depicted 100 % as male, 100 % as Caucasian and 100 % with light skin tone.
Conclusion
Gender and ethnicity bias is a significant limitation for text-to-image generative AI using DALL-E 3 among Australian first responders. Generated images have a disproportionately high misrepresentation of males, Caucasians and light skin tones that are not representative of the diversity of paramedics in Australia today.},

    abstract = {Popular tools like ChatGPT have placed generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the spotlight in recent years. One use of GenAI tools is to generate simulated data—or synthetic data—when the full scope of the required microdata is unavailable. Despite suggestions for educational researchers to use synthetic data, little (if any) computer-assisted language learning (CALL) research has used synthetic data thus far. This study addresses this research gap by exploring the possibility of using synthetic datasets in CALL. The publicly available dataset resembles a typical study with a small sample size (n = 55) performed using a CALL platform. Two synthetic datasets are generated from the original datasets using the synthpop package and generative adversarial networks (GAN) in R (via the RGAN package), which are both common synthetic data generation methods. This study evaluates the synthetic datasets by (a) comparing the distribution between the synthetic and original datasets, (b) examining the model parameters of the rebuilt linear models using the synthetic and original datasets, and (c) examining the privacy disclosure metrics. The results suggest that synthpop better represents the original data and preserves privacy. Notably, the GAN-generated dataset does not produce satisfactory results. This demonstrates GAN’s key challenges alongside the potential benefits of generating synthetic data with synthpop.},

However, with the rapid evolution of consumer demands, traditional aesthetic design processes for personalized products face significant challenges. The core challenge lies in effectively integrating Generative AI, individual differences, and style-based user preference modeling into the personalized product design workflow. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel approach that integrates style-themed information into the generation and evaluation of personalized product aesthetics and a new dataset. In the personalized aesthetic generation phase, a predictive model is developed to infer consumer style preferences. The top-ranked styles are then used as conditional inputs to guide the generation of conceptual design solutions. In the personalized aesthetic evaluation phase, a personalized aesthetic evaluation incorporating style themes is conducted using a hybrid model that combines interaction matrix with collaborative filtering. The proposed method is empirically validated through a case study involving wristwatch design. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both aesthetic design generation and aesthetic personalized evaluation. It proves especially effective in enhancing design efficiency and meeting personalized product aesthetic preferences.},

By extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) to include sustainable policy alignment and policy ambiguity as moderating factors, the research explores how these policy elements influence the relationship between GenAI adoption and SLBs’ discretionary actions. Data was collected from 489 SLBs and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly drive the continuous intention to use GenAI. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions do not have a significant effect. Furthermore, the continuous intention to use GenAI positively influences SLBs’ discretion in policy implementation, with sustainable policy alignment strengthening this relationship and diminishing policy ambiguity. A multi-group analysis reveals notable differences between Iraq and Oman. In Oman, all UTAUT2 variables are significant, reflecting a supportive and stable governance environment. In contrast, in Iraq, individual perceptions dominate, likely due to higher policy ambiguity and weaker institutional support. These results underscore the importance of emphasizing GenAI’s practical benefits and ease of use and advocate for developing clear, supportive policies that empower SLBs. This study extends the theoretical foundations of UTAUT2 in the public sector, offering practical insights for policymakers and organizations seeking to leverage GenAI for enhanced sustainability outcomes.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a data-driven methodology for generating and completing PMU phasor measurements using Generative Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on real-world PMU datasets to learn the underlying empirical data distributions without assuming predefined statistical models. The proposed deep generative models are evaluated against traditional statistical techniques based on Gaussian Copulas using a suite of distributional similarity metrics, including Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, Hellinger distance, Maximum Deviation Nearest Neighbor (MDNN), and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test. The GAN model achieved the best distributional fidelity, with KL divergence as low as 0.0106 and Hellinger distance of 0.0435 for voltage signals. In a synthetic data reconstruction task with 0.5% missing values, the GAN reduced the percentage root mean squared error (PRMSE) to 0.52% for voltage and 2.19% for current—significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, the GAN was able to augment the dataset from 1489 to 5000 samples while preserving key statistical properties, as validated by empirical distribution tests. These results demonstrate that deep generative models not only offer superior accuracy but also provide statistically consistent synthetic PMU data, making them a robust alternative to conventional methods for enhancing power system datasets.},

However, its influence on environmental communication problems remains underexplored. This research examines whether exposure to information on an environmental problem provided by GenAI (namely ChatGPT) influences individuals' pro-environmental outcomes in terms of awareness of environmental consequences, moral obligation, and attitudes toward that problem. It addresses the research gap on GenAI's effectiveness compared to traditional sources (digital newspapers) in shaping environmental perceptions, as well as the underlying mechanisms behind this effectiveness. Two experimental studies were conducted with samples of Generation Z users given this demographic's high level of engagement with AI tools. Study 1 examined changes in pro-environmental outcomes when participants were exposed to ChatGPT-generated messages about water scarcity or messages in a digital newspaper. Study 2 focused on the underlying mechanisms of ChatGPT's influence. It examined how perceived usefulness of information mediates this influence and how individual characteristics (psychological distance to the problem and technological innovativeness) moderate this process. Exposure to messages about water scarcity significantly enhanced participants' awareness of consequences, moral obligation, and attitudes toward the problem, regardless of the source. In Study 2, emphasizing problem severity enhanced perceived usefulness, a key factor in shaping pro-environmental outcomes. However, this effect varied based on individual characteristics, with moderation by psychological distance and technological innovativeness. These findings contribute to the growing discussion about the role of GenAI in environmental communication. The paper discusses the potential implications of GenAI for fostering pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors.

    abstract = {Objectives
To explore how generative artificial intelligence (AI) supports clinical reasoning development through simulation-based teaching in undergraduate health professions education.
Design
Scoping review.
Data Sources
CINAHL, ERIC, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases.
Review Methods
A systematic search was conducted to identify studies exploring the integration of generative AI in simulation-based learning. Inclusion criteria focused on undergraduate health professions education and clinical reasoning outcomes.
Results
Six studies with a total of 492 participants met the inclusion criteria. Generative AI was used to create simulation scenarios, virtual patients, provide feedback, analyze student performance, and support inquiry-based learning. Four studies reported significantly improved clinical reasoning outcomes with AI-assisted teaching. One study reported the comparability between AI-generated feedback and expert feedback, though expert input remained superior in complex cases.
Conclusions
The integration of generative AI into simulation-based education is in its early stages. Most studies lacked theoretical frameworks and used diverse outcome measures, limiting comparability and generalizability. Future research should adopt theory-driven designs and standardized assessment tools to better evaluate the impact of generative AI on clinical reasoning development.},

While there is a substantial corpus of research into design-event analysis, the arrival of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened a new portal into describing and distilling the complex ocean environment into something controllable for the engineer to create new realistic ocean environments that can be used for extreme event observation and calculation. In this paper a generative AI method, called GenWave, is presented that shares the same principle as large-language modeling. The method learns the phase relationships in filtered wave data sets so that new wave fields can be generated on demand. GenWaveis based on recurrent neural nets, and it is cast into a bootstrapping algorithm to generate focused wave fields of increasing amplitude. The method is used to generate large waves for both a Gaussian linear water wave, and a non-Gaussian second-order water wave. The comparison of the distributions of phases for the generative AI model to those from Monte-Carlo simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the method to create new dangerous wave fields for time-domain simulation or laboratory experiment.},

These materials have potential application in important areas such as carbon capture, catalysis, gas storage, chemical separation, and drug delivery due to their modular, tunable structures, and their performance in these areas depends on precise control over their structure, chemical functionalities, and properties. Herein, we provide a review of generative AI algorithms that are emerging as powerful tools for the design of nanoporous materials, namely generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, diffusion models, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, and large language models. Some models are particularly good at generating diverse and high-quality designs, while others excel at exploring large design spaces or optimizing materials with desired properties. Certain algorithms also allow for efficient transitions between different designs, and some offer versatility in generating materials based on textual input. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and applications of these algorithms in porous material design and emphasize the future potential of integrating AI with experimental workflows to accelerate the development and validation of AI-generated materials.},

Furthermore, we survey advancements in graph-based molecular generative frameworks, LLM-guided protein sequence modeling, and diffusion-based structural prediction pipelines (e.g., RFdiffusion, FrameDiff), which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in de novo protein engineering and conformational sampling. Generative AI is also catalyzing a paradigm shift in structure-based drug discovery via AI-augmented molecular docking (e.g., DiffDock), end-to-end binding affinity prediction, and quantum chemistry-informed neural potentials. We explore the convergence of generative models with Bayesian retrosynthesis planners, self-supervised pretraining on ultra-large chemical corpora, and multimodal integration of omics-derived features for precision therapeutics.

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, including ChatGPT, offer innovative capabilities in sensory and consumer science. Recent empirical studies in sensory and consumer science highlight the potential utility of GenAI in, for example, AI-generated food images and recipes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a comprehensive framework for integrating GenAI into research and development in sensory and consumer science. The framework highlights how GenAI can be applied across the concept, design, and testing phases through an iterative process. The concept phase utilises GenAI to generate research concepts (e.g., proposing ideas such as research questions and hypotheses). The design phase employs GenAI to formulate research designs. During this stage, GenAI assists with creating and validating survey/experimental stimuli and measurement scales. The testing phase applies GenAI to evaluate research ideas and designs by employing “silicon samples,” interactive surveys that enhance engagement and response quality. In the testing phase, GenAI can also analyse unstructured text data, offering more accurate and scalable text analysis than traditional methods, even across diverse languages and cultures. This study also acknowledges potential pitfalls, such as biases in AI outputs, data privacy and security concerns, oversimplification, lack of transparency, and GenAI user misperception. This article encourages greater integration of GenAI by highlighting its potential for the sensory and consumer science community, while addressing its limitations and ensuring adherence to high ethical standards.},

It explores the characteristics of GAI innovation, including compatibility, trialability, and observability, and analyses the communication channels and roles and responsibilities outlined in university policies and guidelines. The findings reveal that universities are proactively addressing GAI integration by emphasising academic integrity, enhancing teaching and learning practices, and promoting equity. Key policy measures include the development of guidelines for ethical GAI use, the design of authentic assessments to mitigate misuse, and the provision of training programs for faculty and students to foster GAI literacy. Despite these efforts, gaps remain in comprehensive policy frameworks, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns and ensuring equitable access to GAI tools.

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (gAI) models, such as DALL-E 2, are promising tools that can generate novel images or artwork based on text input. However, caution is warranted, as these tools generate information based on historical data and are thus at risk of propagating past learned inequities. Women in medicine have routinely been underrepresented in academic and clinical medicine and the stereotype of a male physician persists.
Objective
The primary objective is to evaluate implicit bias among gAI across medical specialties.
Methods
To evaluate for potential implicit bias, 100 photographs for each medical specialty were generated using the gAI platform DALL-E2. For each specialty, DALL-E2 was queried with “An American [specialty name].” Our primary endpoint was to compare the gender distribution of gAI photos to the current distribution in the United States. Our secondary endpoint included evaluating the racial distribution. gAI photos were classified according to perceived gender and race based on a unanimous consensus among a diverse group of medical residents. The proportion of gAI women subjects was compared for each medical specialty to the most recent Association of American Medical Colleges report for physician workforce and active residents using χ2 analysis.
Results
A total of 1900 photos across 19 medical specialties were generated. Compared to physician workforce data, AI significantly overrepresented women in 7/19 specialties and underrepresented women in 6/19 specialties. Women were significantly underrepresented compared to the physician workforce by 18%, 18%, and 27% in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics, respectively. Compared to current residents, AI significantly underrepresented women in 12/19 specialties, ranging from 10% to 36%. Additionally, women represented <50% of the demographic for 17/19 specialties by gAI.
Conclusions
gAI created a sample population of physicians that underrepresented women when compared to both the resident and active physician workforce. Steps must be taken to train datasets in order to represent the diversity of the incoming physician workforce.},

    abstract = {The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has sparked discussions about integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into teacher education. Teacher educators, as key facilitators of pre-service teacher learning, play a critical role in shaping the successful adoption of GenAI. Their perceptions guide curriculum redesign, define promoted practices, and shape how pre-service teachers experience educational uses of GenAI tools, potentially multiplying its impact across future classrooms. This mixed-methods study explored Danish teacher educators’ perceptions of GenAI (n = 91), focusing on its transformative potential and the knowledge pre-service teachers need to acquire. Innovative methods, including GenAI-supported thematic analysis and Natural Language Processing, were used to analyze qualitative and quantitative survey data. Findings reveal diverse perceptions, ranging from enthusiasm for fostering innovative teaching to concerns about ethics, assessment, and safeguarding basic skills. Concerning GenAI’s potential, three key themes emerged: AI literacy, AI didactics, and AI assessment. Regarding required knowledge, teacher educators emphasized multifaceted AI literacies (AI as a teaching tool, as teaching content, and as a learning tool) framed within ethical, cultural, and democratic contexts. Mediation analyses showed that GenAI use mediated the link between both intrinsic motivation and confidence, and perceptions of its potential. Importantly, teacher educators identified a pressing need for both formal professional development and informal, collaborative learning opportunities. This study extends the TPACK framework by incorporating the triadic nature of AI literacy and emphasizes the importance of preparing educators to engage critically and responsibly with GenAI in education.},

However, most of these studies have relied on pretest/posttest designs or interview/questionnaire methods that reflect the researchers’ perspectives. To expand the research on this topic, we take two approaches. Firstly, we investigate how L2 learners of English utilize ChatGPT in a writing task in real time by analyzing recordings of their computer screens collected throughout the writing process. Secondly, we explore how they perceive the usefulness of ChatGPT by analyzing their responses to an open-ended question. Frequency and time-series analyses show that the participants primarily utilized ChatGPT to generate ideas, particularly during the initial stages of writing. They also used it later in the writing process, albeit less frequently and for less time overall, for a word/grammar search/check, polishing, and example generation, alongside idea generation. Semantic network analyses of their responses to the open-ended question further reveal that the participants generally held a positive opinion of ChatGPT, valuing its assistance in content creation and time management, while expressing some concerns. The results emphasize the potential of generative AI in facilitating L2 writing and suggest the importance of digital literacy.},

    abstract = {Background
Trajectory modeling is a long-standing challenge in the application of computational methods to health care. In the age of big data, traditional statistical and machine learning methods do not achieve satisfactory results as they often fail to capture the complex underlying distributions of multimodal health data and long-term dependencies throughout medical histories. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have provided powerful tools to represent complex distributions and patterns with minimal underlying assumptions, with major impact in fields such as finance and environmental sciences, prompting researchers to apply these methods for disease modeling in health care.
Objective
While AI methods have proven powerful, their application in clinical practice remains limited due to their highly complex nature. The proliferation of AI algorithms also poses a significant challenge for nondevelopers to track and incorporate these advances into clinical research and application. In this paper, we introduce basic concepts in generative AI and discuss current algorithms and how they can be applied to health care for practitioners with little background in computer science.
Methods
We surveyed peer-reviewed papers on generative AI models with specific applications to time-series health data. Our search included single- and multimodal generative AI models that operated over structured and unstructured data, physiological waveforms, medical imaging, and multi-omics data. We introduce current generative AI methods, review their applications, and discuss their limitations and future directions in each data modality.
Results
We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines and reviewed 155 articles on generative AI applications to time-series health care data across modalities. Furthermore, we offer a systematic framework for clinicians to easily identify suitable AI methods for their data and task at hand.
Conclusions
We reviewed and critiqued existing applications of generative AI to time-series health data with the aim of bridging the gap between computational methods and clinical application. We also identified the shortcomings of existing approaches and highlighted recent advances in generative AI that represent promising directions for health care modeling.},

    abstract = {Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has emerged as a transformative technology driving environmental sustainability in smart city development. However, the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within AIoT ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Current research predominantly addresses conventional AIoT frameworks, overlooking the innovative potential of advanced deep generative models, such as GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models, transformers, and hybrid architectures, to significantly enhance situational awareness, system optimization, operational robustness, real-time responsiveness, and adaptive decision-making in complex urban environments. Current IoT and AIoT systems continue to face persistent challenges such as data scarcity, poor data quality, limited adaptability, imbalanced datasets, and inadequate context-awareness. This study addresses these gaps by systematically exploring how GenAI can enhance IoT and AIoT functionalities across key domains—namely cognitive augmentation, resource efficiency, cybersecurity, network traffic, and anomaly detection—while examining their synergistic potential to improve environmental performance in sustainable smart cities. Key findings reveal that emerging advancements in integrating GenAI with IoT and AIoT systems greatly improve urban adaptability, autonomy, and resilience by fostering more dynamic, autonomous, and robust systems and infrastructures. Generative models advance the five core pillars of AIoT: sensing, perceiving, learning, visualizing, and decision-making, by enabling proactive, context-aware, and self-adaptive urban systems to enhance their environmental performance. The fusion of generative intelligence with federated learning promotes sustainable, energy-efficient IoT and AIoT deployments by reducing data transmission, thereby lowering communication overhead and safeguarding user privacy. In networked environments, generative models improve synthetic traffic realism and communication efficiency. GenAI also strengthens cybersecurity through enhanced intrusion prevention, threat detection, and resilience in IoT- and AIoT-enabled smart cities. Furthermore, GenAI-driven anomaly detection facilitates early identification and mitigation of irregularities, boosting operational efficiency and system robustness. These findings underscore the powerful synergies of these domains enabled by GAIoT, emphasizing their collaborative potential to cultivate resilient, efficient, and environmentally conscious smart city ecosystems. The proposed conceptual framework, distilled from key findings, integrates GenAI and AIoT by highlighting both domain-specific advancements and their synergistic interactions. This framework holds significant potential to drive sustainable smart city development by fostering AIoT ecosystems that are more intelligent, resource-efficient, adaptive, secure, robust, and autonomous through the strategic application of generative intelligence. The insights from this study provide policymakers, urban planners, system designers, and technology developers with practical guidance to harness GAIoT for enhancing smart city resilience, sustainability, and operational intelligence.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This study examines two central risks affecting continued use of generative AI (GenAI)—AI hallucinations and privacy concerns—and explores how protective behaviors serve as adaptive mechanisms to mitigate these risks.
Design/methodology/approach
Drawing on Protection Motivation Theory, the study tests a risk-adaptive GenAI use model using survey data from 789 users recruited via a Prolific panel. Structural equation modeling is employed to analyze direct and moderating effects.
Findings
Privacy concerns negatively influence user attitudes while positively predicting both personal and system-level protective behaviors. Hallucination risk is similarly associated with negative attitudes but positively predicts information verification. Notably, only information verification significantly moderates the link between attitude and continuance intention.
Originality
The study extends Protection Motivation Theory to the GenAI context by developing and validating new constructs—hallucination risk and system-level privacy-protective behaviors. It reveals how different types of risk trigger distinct behavioral adaptations, highlighting the dual role of risk as both a deterrent and catalyst in GenAI adoption.
Practical implications
The study offers insights that risk perceptions may not deter continued use of GenAI when users perform risk protective behaviors. By highlighting which protective behaviors enhance continued use, the findings inform risk-mitigation strategies for developers, educators, and regulators.},

    abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) developments have ignited interest in how they will impact L2 writers' agency over their academic writing processes. At the same time, higher education (HE) institutions have responded to GenAI by devising policies on their use. Recognizing that L2 writers' processes can be shaped by GenAI, as well as their institutions and instructors' policies, there is a need to understand how L2 writers engage with GenAI tools and negotiate agency as they transition into their studies and find themselves within the boundaries of their HE institution's policies. Through the lens of critical digital literacies (CDL), agency and empowerment, this qualitative study adopted in-depth focus group interviews with a preference selection task to explore how twenty-one post-graduate L2 writers position themselves in relation to GenAI tools and how they and GenAI have been positioned by their instructors. Data were collected within the first month of their post-graduate studies. The findings show that the L2 writers have integrated GenAI into various aspects of their academic writing processes. Their responses suggest that the L2 writers believe the tools empower them and augment their writing abilities. Yet, from a CDL perspective, this may be false empowerment, as the writers showed little critical awareness of how the tools work. At the same time, tensions exist between their perceptions of agency and some of their instructors' GenAI policies. The L2 writers prefer GenAI policies that give them the autonomy to use GenAI flexibly. However, they recognize the need to be accountable for their academic writing and transparent in their GenAI use. Bans on GenAI use were perceived as unfair, restricted agency, and not reflective of GenAI affordances. The findings can inform academic writing training and instructors' policies.},

While computer vision has shown promise in automating safety monitoring, its effectiveness is often hindered by the challenges of efficiently collecting diverse datasets. Generative AI offers a potential solution by augmenting image datasets, enabling more robust construction hazard detection. This paper investigates the use of generative AI for augmenting image data to improve hazard detection performance. Various combinations of generative AI tools and prompting strategies are tested. The results show that the combination of image-guided structured prompting with Stable Diffusion achieves the highest detection performance (mAP@50 of 92.5 %) using 150 augmented images. This represents a substantial improvement compared to the baseline mAP@50 of 51.6 % achieved with real images alone.},

Designed to address the challenges of interference-laden environments typical in beyond the fifth generation (B5G)/sixth generation (6G) systems, the proposed method formulates a complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem to minimize transmit power under stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, GAI-PDPPO incorporates an invertible transformer-based actor-critic architecture capable of modeling high-dimensional channel state information and unknown-source interference. Through the integration of generative pretraining and prioritized experience replay, the framework accelerates convergence and enhances policy generalization. Extensive simulations demonstrate that GAI-PDPPO consistently outperforms standard primal–dual PPO and benchmark solutions, achieving lower power consumption and higher spectral efficiency under varying signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) thresholds and interference conditions.},

Robustness checks, including placebo tests, alternative risk measures, and varying sample windows, confirm the reliability of these results. Mechanism analysis highlights that transitional challenges during GenAI adoption exacerbate systemic vulnerabilities. Smaller banks, rural commercial banks, and banks with higher nonperforming loan ratios (NPL) face heightened risks, while large state-owned banks remain relatively insulated.

    abstract = {Background
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Nonetheless, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to treatment. The lack of engagement with therapeutic materials and exercises between sessions, a necessary component of CBT, is a key determinant of unsuccessful treatment.
Objective
The objective of this study was to test whether the deployment of a generative artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled therapy support tool, which helps patients to engage with therapeutic materials and exercises in between sessions, leads to improved treatment success and patient treatment adherence compared with the standard delivery of CBT exercises through static workbooks.
Methods
We conducted a real-world observational study of 244 patients receiving group-based CBT in 5 of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service Talking Therapies services, comparing 150 (61.5%) patients who used the AI-enabled therapy support tool to 94 (38.5%) patients who used the standard delivery of CBT exercises. The groups were equivalent with respect to the content of the CBT materials and the human-led therapy sessions; however, the intervention group received support from the AI-enabled therapy support tool in conducting CBT exercises.
Results
Patients using the AI-enabled therapy support tool exhibited greater attendance at therapy sessions and fewer dropouts from treatment. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated higher reliable improvement, recovery, and reliable recovery rates when compared to the control group, which was related to the degree of use of the AI-enabled therapy support tool. Moreover, we found that engagement with AI-supported CBT interventions, relative to psychoeducational materials, predicted better treatment adherence and treatment success, highlighting the role of personalization in the intervention’s effectiveness. To investigate the mechanisms of these effects further, we conducted a separate qualitative experiment in a nonclinical sample of users (n=113). Results indicated that users perceived the AI-enabled therapy support tool as most useful for discussing their problems to gain awareness and clarity of their situation as well as learning how to apply coping skills and CBT techniques in their daily lives.
Conclusions
Our results show that an AI-enabled, personalized therapy support tool in combination with human-led group therapy is a promising avenue to improve the efficacy of and adherence to mental health care.},

While GAI has gained significant attention across various domains, its utility in breast cancer research has yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This study aims to fill that gap by synthesizing existing research into a unified document. A comprehensive search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, resulting in the retrieval of 3827 articles, of which 31 were deemed eligible for analysis. The included studies were categorized based on key criteria, such as application types, geographical distribution, contributing organizations, leading journals, publishers, and temporal trends. Keyword co-occurrence mapping and subject profiling further highlighted the major research themes in this field. The findings reveal that GAI models have been applied to improve breast cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome predictions. Geographical and network analyses showed that most contributions come from a few leading institutions, with limited global collaboration. The review also identifies key challenges in implementing GAI in clinical practice, such as data availability, ethical concerns, and model validation. Despite these challenges, the study highlights GAI’s potential to enhance breast cancer research, particularly in generating synthetic data, improving diagnostic accuracy, and personalizing treatment approaches. This review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and stakeholders, providing insights into current research trends, major contributors, and collaborative networks in GAI-based breast cancer studies.

    abstract = {This study explores the use of generative AI (GenAI) and research integrity assessments of use cases by researchers, including PhD students, at Danish universities. Conducted through a survey sent to all Danish researchers from January to February 2024, the study received 2534 responses and evaluated 32 GenAI use cases across five research phases: idea generation, research design, data collection, data analysis, and writing/reporting. Respondents reported on their own and colleagues' GenAI usage. They also assessed whether the practices in the use cases were considered good research practice. Through an explorative factor analysis, we identified three clusters of perception: "GenAI as a work horse", "GenAI as a language assistant only", and "GenAI as a research accelerator". The findings further show varied opinions on GenAI's research integrity implications. Language editing and data analysis were generally viewed positively, whereas experiment design and peer review tasks faced more criticism. Controversial areas included image creation/modification and synthetic data, with comments highlighting the need for critical and reflexive use of GenAI. Usage differed by main research area, with technical and quantitative sciences reporting slightly higher usage and more positive assessments. Junior researchers used GenAI more than senior colleagues, while no significant gender differences were observed. The study underscores the need for adaptable, discipline-specific guidelines for GenAI use in research, developed collaboratively with experts to align with diverse research practices and minimize ethical and practical misalignment.},

Our findings reveal that GenAI capability positively influences internationalization green innovation performance, both directly and indirectly, through supply chain exploratory and exploitative innovation. Notably, artificial intelligence (AI) regulation strengthens, rather than weakens, the positive relationship between GenAI capability and supply chain innovation. This highlights the potential for responsible AI governance to foster sustainable practices.

We examine how AI-generated financial diagnostics can empower SMEs by generating accessible, real-time analysis and insights, thus bolstering the management function and increasing chances of survival and growth. Using a dataset of 1,150 UK SMEs spanning eight years of financial statements, we test a large language model (LLM) prediction assessment and analyse the potential for SMEs to utilise the technology, notwithstanding enterprise-specific constraints. We conclude that AI may be a very effective tool for smaller enterprises to augment the financial management function, although its efficacy hinges on organisational readiness, competence in interpreting data, and the will to act on automated red-flag alerts. These findings offer practical guidance for SMEs seeking to enhance their financial management processes in today's digital era.},

This study aims to investigate the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of investment recommendations of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots for different investment capitals and countries (UK and Bulgaria).
Design/methodology/approach
A two-stage mixed methods approach was used. Prompts were queried into OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing and Google Bard (now Gemini). Finance and investment practitioners and finance and investment lecturers assessed the chatbots’ recommendations through an online questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale. The Chi-squared test, Wilcoxon-signed ranks test, Mann–Whitney U test and Friedman test were used for data analysis to compare GenAIs’ recommendations for the UK and Bulgaria across different amounts of investment capital and to assess the consistency of the chatbots.
Findings
GenAI chatbots’ responses were found to perform medium-to-high in terms of relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification. For the UK sample, the amount of investment had a marginal effect but prompt timing had an interesting impact. Unlike the British sample, the GenAI application, prompt timing and investment amount did not significantly influence the Bulgarian respondents’ evaluations. While the mean responses of the British sample were slightly higher, these differences were not statistically significant, indicating that ChatGPT, Bing and Bard performed similarly in both the UK and Bulgaria.
Originality/value
The study assesses the relevance, accuracy, specificity and justification of GenAI chatbots’ investment recommendations for two different periods, investment amounts and countries.},

    abstract = {Gas turbines (GTs) play a pivotal role in modern energy systems. Accurate thermodynamic modeling is essential for reliable condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Existing GT performance modeling methods have relatively poor generalization and adaptability under different operating conditions and different units. This paper proposes a generative artificial intelligence (AI) embedded thermodynamic modeling method of GTs for adaptive performance matching. Possible component performance curves are automatically generated by the variational autoencoder in the shape view. Speed-dependent map sampling coefficients of the curves are introduced to realize fast matching of various operating conditions. The proposed method is verified on 2 different types of in-service GTs in the industrial field with mean absolute percentage error 0.5% and 0.54%, respectively. The maximum reduction of performance prediction error is 2.37% compared to traditional methods. The proposed method can realize high-precision GT performance adaptive prediction with good generalization and applicability, thus providing guidance for high efficiency operation control and health management. This paper shows an interpretable and reliable approach for the integration of AI with thermodynamics. Following the proposed generative-embedded modeling paradigm, performance prediction of other complex energy systems can also benefit.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a major boom in recent years and is increasingly penetrating the higher education sector. This study focused on the use of ChatGPT by undergraduate management students. We developed a model called the “AI Student Satisfaction with Studies model” (AI 3S-model) to investigate how generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, affects student satisfaction with their management studies. Factors used in the model included AI-related student expectations, AI-related student job expectations, perceived quality of AI among students, and AI-related overall student satisfaction. An online questionnaire was administered to students from economics faculties at various universities in the Czech Republic. We deliberately focused on one specialized economics college and several large economics faculties. The sample comprised 231 respondents. To analyze the data, we applied covariance-based structural equation modelling using maximum likelihood estimation. Our findings indicate that two factors directly and positively affect overall student satisfaction with AI use: their perceived quality of studies and their expectations. Additionally, perceived quality acts as a significant mediator between student expectations and overall satisfaction, as well as between job expectations and overall satisfaction. Students believe that ChatGPT enhances their quality of education, which boosts their overall satisfaction. For management education programs, this means that finding ways to effectively integrate generative AI into students’ learning and establishing reasonable limits is highly beneficial, whereas prohibiting the use of generative AI tools would likely decrease student satisfaction and diminish the perceived quality of their studies.},

    abstract = {Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), and diffusion models have been increasingly applied to address challenges and inefficiencies within the Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) workflows, particularly in design, planning, and construction management. However, its current research landscape remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of trends and unclear pathways for adoption in the construction industry. To address these gaps, a mixed-method review is conducted, combining bibliometric analysis to quantitatively map research trends with qualitative thematic synthesis for in-depth contextual insights. A total of 148 publications were retrieved from Scopus and Google Scholar (2014–2024). The bibliometric analysis identified 49 high-frequency keywords, grouped into six thematic clusters, characterizing the quantitative research landscape. Complementing this, the qualitative synthesis examined five dominant application domains: (1) proactive safety monitoring and risk prevention, (2) generative AI for sustainable construction, (3) automating design through generative intelligence, (4) construction education, and (5) construction management, within which key research gaps and practical challenges are critically examined. Building upon these insights, the study proposes four-level research roadmap spanning (1) industry-level considerations, (2) organizational and stakeholder perspectives, (3) project-level perspectives, and (4) technological integration. Unlike prior reviews that concentrated on isolated single-model technologies or narrowly defined domains, this study offers a comprehensive, cross-domain analysis of generative AI for construction. By employing a mixed-method review—integrating quantitative bibliometric mapping and qualitative thematic synthesis—it bridges technical, organizational, and implementation perspectives to deliver a holistic understanding of the field. Hence, this review offers clear avenues for future investigation, empowering researchers to expand and refine Generative AI toward achieving a more efficient, resilient, and sustainable construction.},

    abstract = {Performance-based fire safety design requires thoroughly evaluating building fire scenarios to ensure comprehensive fire safety. However, conventional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) fire simulations are computationally intensive and time-consuming, limiting the number of scenarios that can be practically analyzed. This study addresses these challenges by using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to predict fire scenes in realistic multi-room building layouts, characterized by complex shapes and intricate wall partitions. Three generative AI models for image generation are employed for this purpose: GAN-based pix2pix and pix2pixHD, as well as the diffusion model. These models were trained on an extensive dataset of CFD fire simulations to generate near-ceiling smoke movement and temperature distribution outcomes. When tested on new unseen building layouts, these models demonstrated remarkable accuracy and provided near real-time assessments. The diffusion model achieved the highest accuracy (>94 %) while requiring the more computational time. The high performance of these models highlights the potential of using generative AI to enhance fire safety engineering by enabling faster and more comprehensive fire risk assessments.},

    abstract = {Objectives
To provide an introduction to the uses of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models, in the field of health technology assessment (HTA).
Methods
We reviewed applications of generative AI in 3 areas: systematic literature reviews, real-world evidence, and health economic modeling.
Results
(1) Literature reviews: generative AI has the potential to assist in automating aspects of systematic literature reviews by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, extracting data, and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence: generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security. Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools.
Conclusions
Although generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications, it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required. Both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current capabilities and limitations.},

Using hermeneutic phenomenology as the philosophical underpinning and research methodology, SEA teachers’ ‘lived experiences’ of using ChatGPT and other GenAI tools were uncovered. 38 teachers from 10 SEA countries participated in 11 focus group interviews over five months. Three themes emerged: Learning Anew; Disequilibrium and Lack of Rootedness; and Ambiguity about New Norms, New Practices. It was found that teachers work with GenAI in deeply personal, fragmented, and continuously evolving ways. GenAI took the form of novel work companions, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of some work practices. It also was a disruptor to old habits of thinking, behaviour and practices. Teachers were in a state of disequilibrium in this new world beset by VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity). Some felt overwhelmed and ‘at breaking point’. A lack of rootedness in teachers’ beliefs and practices emerged. Teachers were generally against the notions of plagiarism and academic integrity held by students who believed the ends justified the means. However, with new ways of teaching, learning and assessment, many teachers recognised their beliefs and practices would have to change. Thus, in the absence of detailed AI guidelines, they called for the urgent need to establish boundaries and teach AI literacy to promote innovative and responsible use. In this VUCA world, more targeted change management training for teachers and students was strongly needed.},

However, integrating AI into academic surgery necessitates addressing ethical concerns such as bias, transparency, and intellectual property. This paper provides guidelines and recommendations based on current literature around the opportunities and ethical challenges of AI in academic surgery. We discuss the underlying mechanisms of large language models, their potential biases, and the importance of responsible usage. Furthermore, we explore the ethical implications of AI in clinical documentation, highlighting improved efficiency and necessary privacy concerns. This review also addresses the critical issue of intellectual property dilemmas posed by AI-generated innovations in university settings. Finally, we propose guidelines for the responsible adoption of AI in academic and clinical environments, stressing the need for transparency, ethical training, and robust governance frameworks to ensure AI enhances, rather than undermines, academic integrity and patient care.},

The research analyses the use and integration of these programs in creative and productive processes based on 25 in-depth interviews with 13 directors and 12 creatives in both regions. The results show that agencies are using generative AI tools, but for different purposes, and that in some cases, AI is related to the advertising creation process, while in others, it is used for tasks related to the design of strategic communication plans or even the design of prototypes and models. Although there is unanimous agreement on the benefits of AI, there are concerns about ethical issues and its use in the finalists' work.

Gastroenterology and hepatology in particular will be transformed due to the multimodal workflows that integrate endoscopic video, radiologic imaging, tabular data, and unstructured note text. GenAI will impact the entire spectrum of clinical experience, from administrative tasks, diagnostic guidance, and treatment recommendations. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, genAI is more flexible, with one platform able to be used across multiple tasks. Initial evidence suggests benefits in lower-level administrative tasks, such as clinical documentation, medical billing, and scheduling; and information tasks, such as patient education and summarization of the medical literature. No evidence exists for genAI solutions for more complex tasks relevant to clinical care, such as clinical reasoning for diagnostic and treatment decisions that may affect patient outcomes. Challenges of output reliability, data privacy, and useful integration remain; potential solutions include robust validation, regulatory oversight, and "human–AI teaming" strategies to ensure safe, effective deployment. We remain optimistic in the potential of genAI to augment clinical expertise due to the adaptability of genAI to handle multiple data modalities to obtain and focus relevant information flows and the human-friendly interfaces that facilitate ease of use. We believe that the potential of genAI for dynamic human-algorithmic interactions may allow for a degree of clinician-directed customization to enhance human presence.},

These challenges span various processes, including design, planning, procurement, inspection, and maintenance. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), capable of producing new and realistic data or content such as text, images, videos, or code from given inputs or existing knowledge, presents innovative solutions to these challenges. While there is an increasing interest in the applications of GenAI in construction, a detailed analysis of its practical uses, advantages, and areas ripe for development is still evolving. This study contributes to this emerging area by offering an insightful analysis of the current state of generative AI in construction. It has three objectives: (1) to identify and categorize the existing and emerging generative AI opportunities and challenges in the construction industry via a Delphi study; (2) to propose a framework enabling construction firms to build customized GenAI solutions; and (3) to illustrate this framework through a case study that employs GenAI model for querying contract documents. Through systematic review and expert consultation, the study identified 76 potential GenAI applications across construction phases and 18 key challenges distributed across domain-specific, technological, adoption, and ethical categories. The case study's findings show that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) improves the baseline large language model (LLM), GPT-4, by 5.2, 9.4, and 4.8 % in terms of quality, relevance, and reproducibility. The study recommends a structured approach to GenAI implementation, emphasizing the need for domain-specific customization, robust validation protocols, and careful consideration of ethical implications.

In response, HEIs focused on regulating its use, particularly among students, before shifting towards advocating for its productive integration within teaching and learning. Since then, many HEIs have increasingly provided policies and guidelines to direct GenAI. This paper presents an analysis of documents produced by 116 US universities classified as as high research activity or R1 institutions providing a comprehensive examination of the advice and guidance offered by institutional stakeholders about GenAI. Through an extensive analysis, we found a majority of universities (N = 73, 63%) encourage the use of GenAI, with many offering detailed guidance for its use in the classroom (N = 48, 41%). Over half the institutions provided sample syllabi (N = 65, 56%) and half (N = 58, 50%) provided sample GenAI curriculum and activities that would help instructors integrate and leverage GenAI in their teaching. Notably, the majority of guidance focused on writing activities focused on writing, whereas references to code and STEM-related activities were infrequent, and often vague, even when mentioned (N = 58, 50%). Finally, more than half of institutions talked about the ethics of GenAI on a broad range of topics, including Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) (N = 60, 52%). Based on our findings we caution that guidance for faculty can become burdensome as policies suggest or imply substantial revisions to existing pedagogical practices.},

@article{ICHIKAWA2025,
    abstract = {Background
Interest has recently increased in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new content. Although the publicly available GenAI tools are not specifically trained in the medical domain, they have demonstrated proficiency in a wide range of medical assessments. The future integration of GenAI in medicine remains unknown. However, the rapid availability of GenAI with a chat interface and the potential risks and benefits are the focus of great interest. As with any significant medical advancement or change, medical schools must adapt their curricula to equip students with the skills necessary to become successful physicians. Furthermore, medical schools must ensure that faculty members have the skills to harness these new opportunities to increase their effectiveness as educators. How medical schools currently fulfill their responsibilities is unclear. Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) in the United States currently train a significant proportion of the total number of medical students. These COMs are in academic settings ranging from large public research universities to small private institutions. Therefore, studying COMs will offer a representative sample of the current GenAI integration in medical education.
Objective
This study aims to describe the policies and training regarding the specific aspect of GenAI in US COMs, targeting students, faculty, and administrators.
Methods
Web-based surveys were sent to deans and Student Government Association (SGA) presidents of the main campuses of fully accredited US COMs. The dean survey included questions regarding current and planned policies and training related to GenAI for students, faculty, and administrators. The SGA president survey included only those questions related to current student policies and training.
Results
Responses were received from 81% (26/32) of COMs surveyed. This included 47% (15/32) of the deans and 50% (16/32) of the SGA presidents (with 5 COMs represented by both the deans and the SGA presidents). Most COMs did not have a policy on the student use of GenAI, as reported by the dean (14/15, 93%) and the SGA president (14/16, 88%). Of the COMs with no policy, 79% (11/14) had no formal plans for policy development. Only 1 COM had training for students, which focused entirely on the ethics of using GenAI. Most COMs had no formal plans to provide mandatory (11/14, 79%) or elective (11/15, 73%) training. No COM had GenAI policies for faculty or administrators. Eighty percent had no formal plans for policy development. Furthermore, 33.3% (5/15) of COMs had faculty or administrator GenAI training. Except for examination question development, there was no training to increase faculty or administrator capabilities and efficiency or to decrease their workload.
Conclusions
The survey revealed that most COMs lack GenAI policies and training for students, faculty, and administrators. The few institutions with policies or training were extremely limited in scope. Most institutions without current training or policies had no formal plans for development. The lack of current policies and training initiatives suggests inadequate preparedness for integrating GenAI into the medical school environment, therefore, relegating the responsibility for ethical guidance and training to the individual COM member.},

We cover various applications of GANs in ophthalmic-related imaging including optical coherence tomography, orbital magnetic resonance imaging, fundus photography, and ultrasound; however, we also highlight several challenges that resulted in the generation of inaccurate and atypical results during certain iterations. Finally, we examine future directions and considerations for generative AI in ophthalmology.},

@article{BLEASE2025,
    abstract = {Background
The potential for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to assist with clinical tasks is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields.
Objective
This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about GenAI on primary care.
Methods
In January 2025, we conducted a web-based survey of 1005 UK GPs’ experiences and opinions of GenAI in clinical practice. This study involved a qualitative inductive descriptive analysis of a written response (“comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. After analysis, the interpretation of themes was also informed by the technology acceptance model.
Results
Out of 1005 respondents, 611 GPs (61%) provided written comments in response to the free text question, totaling 7990 words. Comments were classified into 3 major themes and 8 subthemes in relation to GenAI in clinical practice. The major themes were (1) unfamiliarity, (2) ambivalence and anxiety, and (3) role in clinical tasks. “Unfamiliarity” encompassed a lack of experience and knowledge, and the need for training on GenAI. “Ambivalence and anxiety” included mixed expectations among GPs in relation to these tools, beliefs about diminished human connection, and skepticism about AI accountability. Finally, commenting on the role of GenAI in clinical tasks, GPs believed it would help with documentation. However, respondents questioned AI’s clinical judgment and raised concerns about operational uncertainty concerning these tools. Female GPs were more likely to leave comments than male GPs, with 53% (324/611) of female GPs providing feedback compared to 41.1% (162/394) who did not. Chi-square tests confirmed this difference ((χ²₂= 14.6, P=.001). In addition, doctors who left comments were significantly more likely to have used GenAI in clinical practice compared with those who did not. Among all respondents, 71.7% (438/611) had not used GenAI. However, noncommenters were even less likely to have used it, with 80.7% (318/394) reporting no use. A chi-square test confirmed this difference (χ²₁=10.0, P=.002).
Conclusions
This study provides timely insights into UK GPs’ perspectives on the role, impact, and limitations of GenAI in primary care. However, the study has limitations. The qualitative data analyzed originates from a self-selected subset of respondents who chose to provide free-text comments, and these participants were more likely to have used GenAI tools in clinical practice. However, the substantial number of comments offers valuable insights into the diverse views held by GPs regarding GenAI. Furthermore, the majority of our respondents reported limited experience and training with these tools; however, many GPs perceived potential benefits of GenAI and ambient AI for documentation. Notably, 2 years after the widespread introduction of GenAI, GPs’ persistent lack of understanding and training remains a critical concern. More extensive qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.},

However, the tourism industry is in the early stages of understanding and applying GenAI, and comprehensive knowledge is needed. This paper presents a systematic review of the empirical literature, published between 2022 and 2024, related to GenAI in the business and tourism fields. Findings draw a detailed picture of the state of GenAI research. In total, 170 published articles are reviewed based on topics, theories, and methods. Three main topic clusters are identified: 1) antecedents of using GenAI; 2) impacts and applications of GenAI; and 3) technicalities of GenAI. Theoretically, most studies have borrowed foundations from other fields without substantial development. Methodologically, existing research—particularly in tourism—has tended to feature quantitative techniques. This research also compares business and tourism literature based on an antecedents, process and outcomes framework, outlining potential research gaps and opportunities. In addition to synthesizing the current research landscape, this paper presents a multidimensional framework (i.e., theories, contexts, characteristics, and methods – TCCM) that suggests multiple future research questions to inform GenAI studies in tourism.},

However, its alignment with human perception, particularly in emotional and aesthetic dimensions such as landscape preferences, remains uncertain. This study investigated the discrepancies between human and GPT-4 performance in landscape perception and preference, using the Kaplans’ preference matrix as a benchmark. Survey data were collected from 1,333 participants in China, and five typical landscapes i.e. gray, open green, partly open/closed green, closed green, and blue spaces were evaluated. To simulate human-like responses, artificial intelligence (AI) agents using ChatGPT were created with personal attributes mirroring those of the human sample. Results indicated that GPT-4 demonstrated significant divergences from human perception and preference in assessing landscape coherence, complexity, mystery, legibility, and overall preference. While GPT-4 performed comparably well in simpler environments, such as pure single-layer broadleaf forests on flat terrain, it struggled to capture key elements and emotions in more complex or nuanced urban landscapes. Notably, only 2.4 % of ChatGPT’s responses aligned with human perceptions and preferences. These findings highlighted the limitations of current AI in fully replicating human intelligence in landscape perception, emphasizing the continued necessity of human involvement in human-centered landscape design. This study offers insights into the current limitations of ChatGPT and suggests directions for enhancing its application in landscape design.},

    abstract = {Objectives
In health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), many repetitive tasks could be performed by large language models (LLMs), including adapting Excel-based health economic models and associated Word technical reports to a new setting. However, it is vital to develop robust methods so that the LLM delivers at least human-level accuracy.
Methods
We developed LLM-based pipelines to automate parameter value adaptations for Excel-based models and subsequent reporting of the model results. Chain-of-thought prompting, ensemble shuffling, and task decomposition were used to enhance the accuracy of the LLM-generated content. We tested the pipelines by adapting 3 Excel-based models (2 cost-effectiveness models [CEMs] and 1 budget impact model [BIM]) and their associated technical reports. The quality of reporting was evaluated by 2 expert health economists.
Results
The accuracy of parameter value adaptations was 100% (147 of 147), 100% (207 of 207), and 98.7% (158 of 160) for the 2 CEMs and 1 budget impact model, respectively. The parameter value adaptations were performed without human intervention in 195 seconds, 245 seconds, and 189 seconds. For parameter value adaptations, the application programming interface costs associated with running the pipeline were $13.36, $6.48, and $2.65. The accuracy of report adaptations was 94.4% (17 of 18), 100% (54 of 54), and 95.1% (39 of 41), respectively. The report adaptations were performed in 128 seconds, 336 seconds, and 286 seconds. For report adaptations, the application programming interface costs associated with running the pipeline were $1.53, $4.24, and $4.05.
Conclusions
LLM-based toolchains have the potential to accurately and rapidly perform routine adaptations of Excel-based CEMs and technical reports at a low cost. This could expedite health technology assessments and improve patient access to new treatments.},

This symposium paper seeks to summarize current recommendations on the use of GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, and to provide speculations about the future challenges and opportunities of GenAI use in scientific publishing. Due to the dynamic nature of these tools and the rapid advancement of their sophistication, the most important recommendation is that ongoing engagement and discussion within the scientific community about these issues is critical. When using GenAI tools in scientific article preparation, humans are ultimately accountable and responsible for products produced. Given that accountability, an expert panel convened by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recently proposed principles of GenAI use in science communication, including (1) transparent disclosure and attribution; (2) verification of AI-generated content and analyses; (3) documentation of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated data; (4) a focus on ethics and equity; and (5) continuous monitoring, oversight, and public engagement. In addition to the importance of human accountability, many publishers have established consistent policies suggesting that GenAI tools should not be used for peer reviewing, figure generation or manipulation, or assigned authorship on scientific articles. Along with the potential ethical challenges associated with GenAI use in scientific publishing, there are numerous potential benefits. Herein we summarize example conversations demonstrating the capacity of GenAI tools to support the article preparation process, and an example standard operating procedure for human-AI interaction in article preparation. Finally, diverse broader questions about the impact of GenAI tools on communication, knowledge, and advancement of science are raised for rumination.},

    abstract = {Background
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical research, offering innovative solutions for data collection, patient engagement, and information dissemination. Powerful generative AI (GenAI) tools and other similar chatbots have emerged, facilitating user interactions with virtual conversational agents. However, the increasing use of GenAI tools in medical research presents challenges, including ethical concerns, data privacy issues, and the potential for generating false content. These issues necessitate standardization of reporting to ensure transparency and scientific rigor.
Objective
The development of the Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools in Medical Research (GAMER) reporting guidelines aims to establish comprehensive, standardized guidelines for reporting the use of GenAI tools in medical research.
Methods
The GAMER guidelines are being developed following the methodology recommended by the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network, involving a scoping review and expert Delphi consensus. The scoping review searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar (for the first 200 results) using keywords like “generative AI” and “medical research” to identify reporting elements in GenAI-related studies. The Delphi process involves 30-50 experts with ≥3 years of experience in AI applications or medical research, selected based on publication records and expertise across disciplines (eg, clinicians and data scientists) and regions (eg, Asia and Europe). A 7-point-scale survey will establish consensus on checklist items. The testing phase invites authors to apply the GAMER checklist to GenAI-related manuscripts and provide feedback via a questionnaire, while experts assess reliability (κ statistic) and usability (time taken, 7-point Likert scale). The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Health Data Science at Lanzhou University (HDS-202406-01).
Results
The GAMER project was launched in July 2023 by the Evidence-Based Medicine Center of Lanzhou University and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Guideline Implementation and Knowledge Translation, and it concluded in July 2024. The scoping review was completed in November 2023. The Delphi process was conducted from October 2023 to April 2024. The testing phase began in March 2025 and is ongoing. The expected outcome of the GAMER project is a reporting checklist accompanied by relevant terminology, examples, and explanations to guide stakeholders in better reporting the use of GenAI tools.
Conclusions
GAMER aims to guide researchers, reviewers, and editors in the transparent and scientific application of GenAI tools in medical research. By providing a standardized reporting checklist, GAMER seeks to enhance the clarity, completeness, and integrity of research involving GenAI tools, thereby promoting collaboration, comparability, and cumulative knowledge generation in AI-driven health care technologies.

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has emerged as a transformative technology across all medical specialties, including musculoskeletal (MSK) oncology. These models, such as ChatGPT and others, can process natural language, synthesize vast amounts of information, and generate contextually relevant outputs that resemble human communication. In orthopedic oncology, LLMs show promise in facilitating literature reviews, enhancing patient education, and supporting clinical decision-making by analyzing multidimensional data while providing improved logic-based reasoning. Additionally, they can assist in radiological and pathological workflows by interpreting imaging reports and drafting diagnostic summaries, thereby increasing efficiency and accuracy. In the near future, they are expected to aid in real-time patient follow-up and counseling, information transfer, efficient diagnostics, and even continuous surgical education and assistance. Despite their potential, challenges such as the risk of inaccuracies and biases, as well as the necessity for continuous supervision, warrant a cautious and responsible integration into clinical practice. This narrative review examines the current applications of LLMs in MSK oncology, their limitations, and their future potential in shaping precision medicine and equitable healthcare delivery.},

    abstract = {The production of modern semiconductor chips is susceptible to variations in air temperature, humidity, and quality, mainly as chip dimensions shrink to smaller than atmospheric dust particles. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are critical in this context, given their role in stabilizing these environmental factors. Gaps in Design and Construction (D&C) can critically undermine the reliability, performance, quality, and lifespan of HVAC systems during their Operation and Maintenance (O&M) stages. Current studies illustrate how existing models predicted performance degradation and how the Design, Construction, Operations, and Maintenance (DCOM) gap arises. Despite the substantial implications for Semiconductor Manufacturing Facilities (SMFs), research on HVAC performance degradation remains limited, particularly in capturing and quantifying degradation-related patterns. Compared to other types of buildings, the renovation and transformation of high-end manufacturing facilities are more frequent, and customized design and equipment also lead to model application issues, such as data limitations and incompatibility. This paper aims to propose a novel HVAC system degradation prediction model utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Informer algorithms based on the building characteristics and operation mode of semiconductor facilities to overcome the limitations of data scarcity and long-term prediction, evaluate the comprehensive impact of the gap between D&C and O&M stages on HVAC systems. By integrating data augmentation, this model reduces data dependency and can handle incomplete, inconsistent, or discrete data for early prediction in operation, bridging the gap between D&C and O&M stages, and improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of facility operation and maintenance. In addition to SMFs, the proposed model exhibits considerable application potential in other high-precision building types due to the structural variability.},

During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers a powerful avenue for peptide design, yet this process remains challenging due to vast sequence space, complex structure-activity relationships, and the need to balance antimicrobial potency with low toxicity. Here, we introduce AMP-Diffusion, a latent diffusion model fine-tuned on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) sequences using embeddings from protein language models (pLMs). AMP-Diffusion enables the rapid discovery of antibiotic candidates by systematically exploring sequence space. We generated 50,000 candidate sequences, filtered and ranked them using our APEX deep learning (DL) model, and synthesized 46 top candidates. These peptides showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, while exhibiting low cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies revealed membrane permeabilization and depolarization as primary modes of action. In a preclinical mouse model, lead peptides reduced bacterial loads with efficacy comparable to polymyxin B and levofloxacin, with no detectable adverse effects. AMP-Diffusion thus presents a robust platform for designing antibiotics.},

    abstract = {Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for future wireless networks, aiming to improve communication efficiency by transmitting only the semantic meaning (or its encoded version) of the source data rather than the complete set of bits (symbols). However, traditional deep learning-based SemCom systems present challenges such as limited generalization, low robustness, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, primarily due to the inherently discriminative nature of deep neural networks. To address these limitations, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is seen as a promising solution, offering notable advantages in learning complex data distributions, transforming data between high- and low-dimensional spaces, and generating high-quality content. This paper explores the applications of GAI in SemCom and presents a comprehensive study. It begins by introducing three widely used SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model, the corresponding SemCom architecture, and a literature review of recent developments are provided. Subsequently, a novel generative SemCom system is proposed, incorporating cutting-edge GAI technology—large language models (LLMs). This system features LLM-based artificial intelligence (AI) agents at both the transmitter and receiver, which act as “brains” to enable advanced information understanding and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. Unlike traditional systems that focus on bitstream recovery, this design allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content from the coded semantic information sent by the transmitter. As a result, the communication paradigm shifts from “information recovery” to “information regeneration,” marking a new era in generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53% improvement in average retrieval accuracy compared to traditional communication systems. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom are described, followed by a discussion of three open issues for future research. In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for applying GAI in SemCom, laying the groundwork for the efficient deployment of generative SemCom in future wireless networks.},

    abstract = {Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.},

However, deducing these equation-based models requires extensive trial-and-error and strong intuitions. While neural networks may enable the parameterization of material models, they require additional costs for supervised learning and may lead to slower inference. In this paper, we introduce a generative artificial intelligence approach that does not require additional supervised learning to recover the yield surface. Instead, a generative latent diffusion model allows us to deduce yield points with maximum likelihood in the stress space, allowing the model to generalize from sparse or incomplete experimental data. A new projection-based stress update algorithm designed specifically for the mesh-based models enables parallelized integration without the numerical instability or high computational cost of traditional return mapping schemes. Numerical benchmarks–ranging from classical plasticity models to data from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of single-crystal copper–demonstrate that the proposed framework improves robustness, scalability, and inference accuracy. This work contributes a new class of data-driven plasticity models that are computationally efficient and well-suited for complex, path-dependent material behaviors.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) promises to reduce P&ID development time by supporting engineers. Previous research on generative AI in chemical process design mainly represented processes by sequences. However, graphs offer a promising alternative because of their permutation invariance. We propose the Graph-to-SFILES model, a generative AI method to predict control structures from flowsheet topologies. The Graph-to-SFILES model takes the flowsheet topology as a graph input and returns a control-extended flowsheet as a sequence in the SFILES 2.0 notation. We compare four different graph encoder architectures, one of them being a graph neural network (GNN) proposed in this work. The Graph-to-SFILES model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 73.2% when trained on 10,000 flowsheet topologies. In addition, the proposed GNN performs best among the encoder architectures. Compared to a purely sequence-based approach, the Graph-to-SFILES model improves the top-5 accuracy for a relatively small training dataset of 1,000 flowsheets from 0.9% to 28.4%. However, the sequence-based approach performs better on a large-scale dataset of 100,000 flowsheets. These results highlight the potential of graph-based AI models to accelerate P&ID development in small-data regimes but their effectiveness on industry relevant case studies still needs to be investigated.},

    abstract = {With the recent and rapid growth of the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), including the use of large language models (LLMs) there has been growing concern amongst higher education institutions regarding assessment, potential plagiarism, and ultimately a negative impact on student learning outcomes. However, GAI is likely to be a useful tool in future professional environments, including in many chemical engineering-related roles. It is, therefore, essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to use GAI responsibly, ethically, and safely. This research adopts the IDEE (Identify desired outcomes, Determine level of automation, Ensure ethics, Evaluate effectiveness) framework to develop a chemical engineering lab session which is augmented by the use of LLMs. As part of the pre-lab work, Year 1 students were tasked with using ChatGPT v3.5 to derive a model which predicted the drainage profile of water from a tank. They then tested the validity of this model experimentally in a lab session and analysed the data obtained as part of the post-lab work. Pre- and post-lab surveys were conducted which revealed that students had limited prior experience with GAI but there was a general belief that it could be useful for future work. The post-lab survey showed that the vast majority of people believed that this exercise had helped them learn how to use LLMs, how to use it ethically, how to critique the output, and what some of its limitations were. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied to the qualitative data obtained in the same surveys. This revealed eight distinct themes, one of which showed that there was a strong awareness of the need for criticising the LLM output, of the potential pitfalls associated with its use, and concerns over the quality of the output. As such, this work provides not just a case study for the integration of LLMs, and GAI more broadly, into chemical engineering curricula, but also valuable insight into student perceptions regarding the use of this nascent technology more generally.},

Generative AI(GAI) has potential to bridge these gaps with adaptive, engaging and aligned curriculum content to support learning specially for out-of-school children. It enables adaptable access to education through visual, text and audio format in remote and underserved mountainous areas. This analysis includes key applications, challenges and solutions of GAI in education for out of school from an initial pool of 90 studies sourced from scholarly databases such as IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Google Scholar (different published included). After exhaustive screening, 30 major papers were reviewed to evaluate the potential of GAI in out-of-school children’s education. The findings highlight the significant role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in enabling inclusive education by offering tailored content through Learning Management Systems (LMS). A theoretical model is proposed integrating GAI, LMS, adaptive and data-driven methodologies (A&DM), operational and ethical safety framework, implementation strategy, team structure, and financial considerations. Besides offering content, LMS gathers information to analyze individual needs and create appropriate instructional material. Local community facilitators are essential in reinforcing learning, bridging digital divides, and ensuring a supportive education atmosphere. The study addresses strengths, limitations, and suitability associated with GAI integration, such as integrity in assessment, critical thinking, potential disruptions, data reliability, and human interaction. This study shows GAI's potential in access, inclusivity, and engagement through strategic partnerships, adaptive approaches, and targeted efforts.},

@article{HUANG2025101336,
    abstract = {Background
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) has rapidly advanced in multimodal information processing, particularly in medical applications such as the refinement of instruments and interpretation of medical images. However, limited evidence exists on the diagnostic performance of Gen-AI models in tumor recognition, particularly using computed tomography (CT) images. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic capabilities of several prevelant Gen-AI models (GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-pro-vision, Claude-3-opus) in the context of lung CT image analysis.
Methods
This retrospective study analyzed chest CT scans from 404 patients with lung conditions with lung neoplasms (n=184) and non-malignancy (n=210). After standardizing CT images, the diagnostic performance and reliability of three Gen-AI (GPT-4-turbo, Gemini-pro-vision, and Claude-3-opus) were assessed using chi-square tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves across various clinical scenarios. Likert scale scoring and response rate analysis were employed to evaluate internal diagnostic tendencies, while regression analyses were conducted for model optimization.
Findings
In a cueing environment limited to a single CT image, Gemini demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy (92.21%), followed by Claude (91.49%), while GPT exhibited the lowest performance (65.22%). As the complexity of the cueing environment increased, all models experienced a decline in diagnostic accuracy. Claude showed a marginal decrease, whereas Gemini's accuracy fluctuated significantly. Under simplified cueing conditions, the performance of all models improved notably (Gemini AUC = 0.76, Claude AUC = 0.69, GPT AUC = 0.73). Feature identification analysis revealed that Claude and GPT excelled in recognizing key features, particularly prioritizing “Morphology/Margins” when diagnosing primary malignancies, with “spiculated” and “irregular” serving as critical indicators. However, in cases of misdiagnosis or missed diagnoses, Gen-AI exhibited significant deviations across multiple feature dimensions—some even completely contradicted the actual findings. Following optimization through Lasso and stepwise regression, the diagnostic performance of the models was significantly enhanced (AUC = 0.896 and AUC = 0.894, respectively).
Interpretation
Gen-AI shows promising potential in pulmonary CT imaging, particularly in simplified diagnostic settings. However, their limitations in processing complex multi-modal information highlight significant challenges for clinical integration. Ongoing efforts to improve the robustness and reliability of these models are crucial for their successful adoption in healthcare.},

    abstract = {Background
Social robots (SR), sensorimotor machines designed to interact with humans, can help to respond to the increasing demands in the health care sector. To ensure the successful use of this technology, acceptance is paramount. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with the potential to enhance the functionality of SR and promote user acceptance by further improving human-robot interaction.
Objective
We present a protocol for a scoping review of the literature on the implementation of generative AI in SR in the health care sector. The aim of this scoping review is to map out the intersection of SR and generative AI in the health care sector; to explore if generative AI is applied in SR in the health care sector; to outline which models of generative AI and SR are used for these implementations; and to explore whether user acceptance is reported as an outcome following these implementations. This scoping review supports future research by providing an overview of the state of connectedness of 2 emerging technologies and by mapping out research gaps.
Methods
We follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the recommendations by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Our protocol was drafted using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). We will conduct a systematic literature search of the online databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore, aiming to retrieve relevant data items via tabular data charting from references meeting specific inclusion criteria which are studies published from 2010 onwards, set in the health care sector, focusing on SR with physical bodies and implemented generative AI. There are no restrictions on study types. Results will be categorized, clustered, and summarized using tables, graphs, visual representations, and narratives.
Results
After conducting a preliminary search and deduplication in the second quarter of 2024, we retrieved 3176 preliminary results. This scoping review will be supplemented with the next methodological steps, including retrieving the results in a reference management tool as well as screening titles, abstracts, and full text regarding specific inclusion criteria. The completion of these steps is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025. Limitations based on the heterogeneity of the included studies and the general breadth of a scoping review compared to a systematic review are to be expected. To reduce bias, we adopted a system of dual reviews and thorough documentation of the study selection.
Conclusions
The conducted preliminary search implies that there are a sufficient number of heterogeneous references to complete this scoping review. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review on generative AI in health care SR.

    abstract = {Health communication and promotion on the internet have evolved over time, driven by the development of new technologies, including generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). These technological tools offer new opportunities for both the public and professionals. However, these advancements also pose risks of exacerbating health disparities. Limited research has focused on combining these health communication mediums, particularly those enabled by new technologies like GenAI, and their applications for health promotion and health disparities. Therefore, this viewpoint, adopting a conceptual approach, provides an updated overview of health communication mediums and their role in understanding health promotion and disparities in the GenAI era. Additionally, health promotion and health disparities associated with GenAI are briefly discussed through the lens of the Technology Acceptance Model 2, the uses and gratifications theory, and the knowledge gap hypothesis. This viewpoint discusses the limitations and barriers of previous internet-based communication mediums regarding real-time responses, personalized advice, and follow-up inquiries, highlighting the potential of new technology for public health promotion. It also discusses the health disparities caused by the limitations of GenAI, such as individuals’ inability to evaluate information, restricted access to services, and the lack of skill development. Overall, this study lays the groundwork for future research on how GenAI could be leveraged for public health promotion and how its challenges and barriers may exacerbate health inequities. It underscores the need for more empirical studies, as well as the importance of enhancing digital literacy and increasing access to technology for socially disadvantaged populations.},

    abstract = {Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) targets identifying forgery cues in audio generated by text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), voice editing, etc. With the advancement of generative artificial intelligence(AI), ADD has gained increasing attention. In recent years, mono-to-binaural (M2B) conversion has been explored in ADD to uncover forgery cues from a novel perspective. However, M2B-based methods may weaken or overlook unique forgery cues specific to mono, limiting detection performance. To this end, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Multi-Source Cues Fusion network for more accurate ADD (HMSCF-ADD). This approach leverages mono alongside binaural left and right channels as three distinct sources for hierarchical information fusion, it distinguishes common and binaural-specific features while removing redundant information for more effective detection. Specifically, binaural-specific and common features are first extracted and fused as binaural information, followed by dynamic fusion of mono and binaural information to achieve hierarchical fusion. Experiments on ASVspoof2019-LA and ASVspoof2021-PA datasets demonstrate that HMSCF-ADD outperforms all mono-input and M2B-based baselines. Detailed comparisons on fusion strategies and M2B conversion further validate the framework’s effectiveness. The codes are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/HMSCF-ADD.},

All participants were international students, from a total of 14 countries and regions, studying in the United Kingdom. Data collection was carried out in two phases. The first was a survey comprising demographic and metaphor-related questions, and the second involved metaphor checking, in which participants provided screenshots of their interactions with GenAI. The data, which were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, yielded 53 unique metaphors for the concept of GenAI in academic writing. We divided these into four conceptual categories in what we term the 4T Pyramid Model: Technical Support (representative metaphor: high-heeled shoes), Text Development (compass), Transformative Potential (Spider-Man), and Threat (drug). The respondents' academic disciplines influenced their perceptions of GenAI, but overall, the results suggest that most viewed it as transformative, i.e., more than just a writing tool. This study's innovative methodology integrating metaphor analysis with real user interactions offers a framework, aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy, that reveals the multi-level benefits and potential risks of GenAI.

While existing approaches attempt to address this challenge, they often fail to balance privacy protection with data utility, struggle to achieve effective information fusion across heterogeneous data distributions, and incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce the NATION approach, an innovative GAN-based framework that advances multi-party data publishing through sophisticated information fusion techniques while maintaining stringent differential privacy guarantees and computational efficiency. In NATION, we modify the traditional GAN architecture through a distributed design where multiple discriminators are strategically allocated across parties while centralizing the generator at a semi-trusted server, enabling seamless fusion of distributed knowledge with minimal computational cost. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key technical innovations: an iterative-aware adaptive noise IAN method that dynamically optimizes noise injection based on training convergence, and a global-aware discriminator regularization GDR method that leverages Bregman Divergence to enhance inter-discriminator information exchange while ensuring model stability. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that NATION consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 7% in accuracy while providing provable privacy guarantees, which makes a significant advancement in secure GAN-based information fusion for privacy-sensitive applications.},

In three experiments (N = 513), it was found that perceived alignment between user's political orientation and bias in generated content (in text and images) increases acceptance and reliance on GAI. Participants who perceived alignment were more likely to grant GAI access to sensitive smartphone functions and to endorse the use in critical domains (e.g., loan approval; social media moderation). Because users see GAI as a social actor, they consider perceived alignment as a sign of greater objectivity, thus granting aligned GAI access to more sensitive areas.},

This study integrates GenAI adoption into the Entrepreneurial Event Model to examine its influence on perceived desirability, feasibility, and entrepreneurial intention. Using stratified random sampling, data from 1061 Vietnamese university students were analyzed via polynomial regression and response surface analysis. The findings confirm that both the incorporation and infusion of GenAI enhance entrepreneurial intentions, primarily by increasing desirability and feasibility. Cognitive alignment between desirability and feasibility emerged as critical: intentions peak when both are high and congruent, while misalignment dampens commitment. This study contributes to entrepreneurial intention theory by introducing GenAI as a cognitive trigger and uncovering curvilinear effects in cognitive evaluations. Practical implications underscore the need for AI literacy, the structured integration of AI into entrepreneurship education, and supportive ecosystems for AI-driven startups.},

However, the huge potential power demand from the widespread application of AI may challenge the carrying capacity of the power system. This paper uses the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) to study the impact of the explosive growth of AI on China’s power demand and supply structure. The exponential growth of AI computing power will drive a rapid increase in China’s power demand, and data centers are expected to become the third largest power-using sector in addition to the industry and residential sector. The explosive growth of AI will likely accelerate the growth of coal power generation, while slowing down the decline of the share of coal power, and further highlighting the attributes of coal power to maintain supply. Increasing the installed capacity of renewable energy can mitigate the negative impact of AI growth on the cleaner power supply transformation. The research results in this paper put forward targeted policy recommendations in terms of regulating power consumption in data centers, accelerating the growth of renewable energy installed capacity, and cautiously withdrawing from coal power in phases.},

Drawing on theories of machine heuristics, this study explores how relational cues in AI-authored crisis apologies shape emotional and cognitive responses that ultimately influence trust and forgiveness. A 3 (authorship attribution: AI vs. human vs. control) x 2 (relational tone: warmth vs. competence) between-subjects factorial design with 464 participants was conducted to assess if and how incorporating a warm tone into AI-generated apologies can help overcome AI's inherent limitations associated with machine heuristics. Results show that human-authored apologies are perceived as more sincere, with warmth enhancing their positive impact. AI authorship elicited more negative emotions and reduced perceived sincerity compared to human authorship; however, relational tone was found to moderate the indirect effects of authorship on trust and forgiveness through negative emotions and perceived sincerity. These findings highlight the importance of both emotional and cognitive mechanisms in AI-mediated communication. This research advances an understanding of AI-mediated communication, identifying relational tone as a critical moderator of machine heuristic effects in crisis communication contexts. By integrating both emotional (negative affect) and cognitive (perceived sincerity) mediators into the model, this research provides a deeper understanding of how audiences evaluate and respond to AI-generated apologies in crisis contexts. Additionally, it offers a novel application of machine heuristic theory, extending its relevance to reputational management and organizational transparency.},

This paper argues that GenAI represents a qualitative shift that necessitates a fundamental reassessment of AI's role in management and organizations. By identifying and analyzing four critical dimensions (i) GenAI's broad applicability as a general-purpose technology; (ii) its ability to catalyze exploratory and combinatorial innovation; (iii) its capacity to enhance cognitive diversity and decision-making; and (iv) its democratizing effect on AI adoption and value creation the paper highlights GenAI's potential to augment and scale human creativity, learning, and innovation. Building on insights from the AI and management literature, as well as on theory of human-AI agency, the paper develops a novel perspective that challenges the dominant efficiency-oriented narrative. It proposes that a human-complementary approach to GenAI development and implementation, leveraging it as a generative catalyst for exploration, can enable radically increased creativity, innovation, and growth. GenAI's democratizing aspects can amplify these mechanisms, promoting widely shared growth when combined with appropriate policy and managerial choices. Implications for theory, practice, and future research directions are discussed, drawing attention to the need for approaches in GenAI development and deployment that are complementary rather than competitive to human beings. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical, practical, and policy implications of this transformative technology. It outlines future research directions, emphasizing the critical role of human agency in determining the organizational, societal, and ethical outcomes associated with AI adoption and implementation.},

While tools like ChatGPT can act as virtual experts, offering immediate feedback and engaging learners in reflective dialogues, little is known about how L2 readers interact with them in their academic practices and how their reading processes evolve. Taking a sociocognitive view, grounded in sociocultural theory and interpreted through the heuristic lens of the Direct and Inferential Mediation (DIME) model of reading comprehension, this exploratory case study examined how one international graduate student engages with GenAI to enhance academic reading. Data were collected over six weeks through screen-recordings of reading sessions, chat logs, stimulated recall interviews, and semi-structured interviews. Findings revealed that ChatGPT functioned as a translator, knowledge facilitator, and strategic partner, reducing reading anxiety while supporting comprehension across key components of the DIME model, such as vocabulary knowledge, background knowledge, inference-making, and reading strategies. Notably, the learner demonstrated a shift in reading approach, moving from an initial dependence on translation toward more strategic engagement with academic texts, including the use of summarization and inference. However, perceived AI limitations, such as questionable reliability and excessively detailed responses, occasionally caused fatigue for the learner. By providing an in-depth exploration of human-AI interaction in academic reading, the study contributes to the growing body of literature on GenAI's role in L2 education, laying the groundwork for future studies on its long-term impact on L2 reading.},

Traditional design methods often focus on reconstructing functional motifs, but they face challenges in stabilizing structure and reproducing function. In this study, we aimed to develop a design method for small proteins using ProtGPT2, a model that generates protein sequences based on function and structure. First, amino acid sequence data of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) was collected, and ProtGPT2 was fine-tuned (ProtGPT2 for MDH). The chain length and perplexity (ppl) of the generated sequences were evaluated, producing shorter sequences than the natural ones. The validity of the generated sequences was assessed using both population and individual analyses. Population analysis, including multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), revealed that ProtGPT2 for MDH identified functional motifs of MDH and incorporated them into the generated sequences. Additionally, tSNE showed that the generated sequences were highly similar to natural MDH sequences. In individual analysis, 10 randomly selected sequences were evaluated using BLAST, AlphaFold2, and InterPro. BLAST indicated that 9 sequences were novel MDH variants. AlphaFold2 confirmed that their 3D structures were highly similar to known MDH structures. InterPro identified domains and active sites in 2 sequences, suggesting that they were novel, small MDH variants. In conclusion, ProtGPT2 for MDH has the potential to design amino acid sequence candidates for small MDHs. The validity and utility of the model will be established through future experimental efforts.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) is significantly influencing teaching and learning. The uptake of genAI in schools and universities/colleges has been rapid. But it has also been ad hoc and often ineffectively implemented, with little recognition of the need to manage cognitive burden to account for individual differences between novice and expert learners. Harnessing cognitive and instructional psychology principles, load reduction instruction (LRI) offers guidance for implementing genAI in ways that accommodate differences among novice and expert learners. LRI comprises five principles aimed at productively easing the cognitive burden on learners: (1) difficulty reduction as appropriate to prior learning, (2) support and scaffolding, (3) structured practice, (4) feedback-feedforward, and (5) independent practice and problem-solving. We suggest that the future of genAI-related learning can benefit from synthesizing genAI implementation with the core principles underpinning LRI to effectively manage the cognitive burden on diverse students as they engage with genAI to learn.},

    abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly ChatGPT, have demonstrated significant potential in addressing the persistent treatment gap in mental health care. Systematic evaluation of ChatGPT’s capabilities in addressing mental health questions is essential for its large-scale application. The current study introduces a computational evaluation framework centered on perceived information quality (PIQ) to quantitatively assess ChatGPT’s capabilities. Leveraging datasets of question-answer pairs generated by both humans and ChatGPT, the framework integrates predictive modeling, explainable modeling, and prompt-engineering-based validation to identify intrinsic evaluation metrics and enable automated assessments. Results revealed that unprompted ChatGPT’s PIQ is significantly lower than that of human counselors overall, with notable deficiencies such as insufficient conversational length, lower text diversity, and reduced professionalism. Despite not matching the top 25% of human counselors, our evaluation framework improved ChatGPT’s mean PIQ by 8.91% to 11.67% across four risk levels. Prompted ChatGPT performed comparably to human counselors in severe (p = 0.0561) and moderate-risk questions (p = 0.7851), and significantly outperformed them in low- and no-risk categories by 6.80% and 4.63%, respectively (p < 0.001). However, undesirable verbal behaviors still persist in text diversity and professionalism. These findings validate ChatGPT’s capabilities to address mental health questions while cautioning that further researches are necessary for LLM-based mental health systems to deliver services comparable to human experts.},

Feature engineering was used to represent shear wall and beam layouts as graph data enhanced through data augmentation to improve GNN model generalization. The GraphSAGE algorithm analyzed the graph to simultaneously generate the shear wall and beam layouts followed by postprocessing for extraction and optimization based on encoded design rules.

    abstract = {In recent years, tunnel boring machines (TBMs) have been widely used in tunnel construction. Rockbursts, as a dynamic geological disaster, pose a serious threat to the safety and efficient tunneling of TBMs. The microseismic monitoring technique provides an effective solution for rockburst warning. However, due to the complexity and variability of the TBM excavation environment, microseismic events induced by rock fracture are often accompanied by interference events, such as electrical noise, TBM vibration, and mechanical knock. This study proposes a multi-channel intelligent classification approach for microseismic events in TBM excavation scenarios, based on double-layer stacking learning, to identify rock fractures. In this approach, decision tree is used as the base classifier on each microseismic channel, while extreme learning machine is employed as the meta-classifier to aggregate all base classifiers. Additionally, mind evolutionary computation is integrated to optimize the built-in hyperparameters of various classifiers. Meanwhile, a comprehensive preprocessing and augmentation flow for microseismic data has been developed, encompassing feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, outlier detection, and outlier substitution. The results reveal that the multi-channel stacking model, which combines classification and regression tree and extreme learning machine, achieves optimal global and local generalization performance compared to other multi-channel stacking models and traditional single-channel models. The accuracy, Hamming loss, and Cohen’s kappa are 96.75%, 0.0325, and 0.9148, respectively, and the F1-score and AUC on rock fracture events are 0.9366 and 0.9818, respectively. Finally, a generative artificial intelligence-based scheme is invented to enhance the robustness of the model for signal-mixing events.},

Therefore, the present research aimed to investigate individual differences in trusting ChatGPT and other generative AI tools by asking study participants not only about trust in these products but also to explore associations with the attitude towards AI (ATAI) scale and a newly developed measure called the AI-Interaction Positivity Scale (AI-IPS) scale. Of note, further associations between all investigated variables are also presented. The AI-IPS investigates the degree to which humans experience positive emotions and are satisfied when interacting with products in which AI is built in. A final sample of n = 1073 was analyzed, and it was demonstrated that the new AI-IPS has sufficient psychometric properties and is positively linked to trusting ChatGPT (r = 0.698; here a subsample of n = 649 participants was investigated to determine trust in ChatGPT). Of note, this observed association was comparable (although a bit higher) to correlations between positive attitudes towards AI and trust in ChatGPT. Of further interest, satisfaction with life was assessed. Here, a mild positive association between AI-Interaction Positivity and life satisfaction was demonstrated (r = 0.214). This observation leads to interesting new research questions, namely, the potential causality between these variables (please note that causality cannot be established here because of the cross-sectional nature of the present work).},

Research results show that CAE-MLE achieves the highest generation accuracy and robustness, while CVAE offers more variability through latent space sampling. DDMs provide controllable generation variability via a stochasticity parameter in the inverse diffusion process. The proposed framework enables efficient generation of multiple design solutions and can potentially accelerate the conceptual design workflows in structural engineering.

    abstract = {Background
Living kidney donation (LKD), where individuals donate one kidney while alive, plays a critical role in increasing the number of kidneys available for those experiencing kidney failure. Previous studies show that many generous people are interested in becoming living donors; however, a huge gap exists between the number of patients on the waiting list and the number of living donors yearly.
Objective
To bridge this gap, we aimed to investigate how to identify potential living donors from discussions on public social media forums so that educational interventions could later be directed to them.
Methods
Using Reddit forums as an example, this study described the classification of Reddit content shared about LKD into three classes: (1) present (presently dealing with LKD personally), (2) past (dealt with LKD personally in the past), and (3) other (LKD general comments). An evaluation was conducted comparing a fine-tuned distilled version of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with inference using GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). To systematically evaluate ChatGPT’s sensitivity to distinguishing between the 3 prompt categories, we used a comprehensive prompt engineering strategy encompassing a full factorial analysis in 48 runs. A novel prompt engineering approach, dialogue until classification consensus, was introduced to simulate a deliberation between 2 domain experts until a consensus on classification was achieved.
Results
BERT and GPT-3.5 exhibited classification accuracies of approximately 75% and 78%, respectively. Recognizing the inherent ambiguity between classes, a post hoc analysis of incorrect predictions revealed sensible reasoning and acceptable errors in the predictive models. Considering these acceptable mismatched predictions, the accuracy improved to 89.3% for BERT and 90.7% for GPT-3.5.
Conclusions
Large language models, such as GPT-3.5, are highly capable of detecting and categorizing LKD-targeted content on social media forums. They are sensitive to instructions, and the introduced dialogue until classification consensus method exhibited superior performance over stand-alone reasoning, highlighting the merit in advancing prompt engineering methodologies. The models can produce appropriate contextual reasoning, even when final conclusions differ from their human counterparts.},

Our approach successfully reconstructed images of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, HeLa cells, and beads, achieving 91 % accuracy on the test dataset. Validation using the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) and Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) produced scores of 0.97 for breast cancer cells and 0.93 for beads, confirming the high precision of this method.

This study aimed to systematically map the development methods, scope, and limitations of existing artificial intelligence (AI) reporting guidelines in medicine and to explore their applicability to generative AI (GAI) tools, such as large language models (LLMs).
Study Design and Setting
We reported a scoping review adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Five information sources were searched, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, FAIRsharing, and Google Scholar, from inception to December 31, 2024. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data using a predefined Excel template. Data included guideline characteristics (eg, development methods, target audience, AI domain), adherence to EQUATOR Network recommendations, and consensus methodologies. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer.
Results
Sixty-eight AI reporting guidelines were included; 48.5% focused on general AI, whereas only 7.4% addressed GAI/LLMs. Methodological rigor was limited; 39.7% described development processes, 42.6% involved multidisciplinary experts, and 33.8% followed EQUATOR recommendations. Significant overlap existed, particularly in medical imaging (20.6% of guidelines). GAI-specific guidelines (14.7%) lacked comprehensive coverage and methodological transparency.
Conclusion
Existing AI reporting guidelines in medicine have suboptimal methodological rigor, redundancy, and insufficient coverage of GAI applications. Future and updated guidelines should prioritize standardized development processes, multidisciplinary collaboration, and expanded focus on emerging AI technologies like LLMs.},

In health care settings, LLMs are being applied to several clinically important areas, including patient care and workflow efficiency, communications, hospital operations and data management, medical education, practice management, and health care research. Under the umbrella of patient care, several core use cases of LLMs include simplifying documentation tasks, enhancing patient communication (interactive language and written), conveying medical knowledge, and performing medical triage and diagnosis. However, LLMs warrant scrutiny when applied to health care tasks, as errors may have negative implications for health care outcomes, specifically in the context of perpetuating bias, ethical considerations, and cost-effectiveness. Customized LLMs developed for more narrow purposes may help overcome certain performance limitations, transparency challenges, and biases present in contemporary generalized LLMs by curating training data. Methods of customizing LLMs broadly fall under 4 categories: prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, fine-tuning, and agentic augmentation, with each approach conferring different information-retrieval properties for the LLM.

We established κ ≥ 0.8 as the threshold for strong agreement based on rigorous methodological standards. Our findings revealed that even the best-performing model (DeepSeek-V3) achieved only moderate agreement (κ = 0.68), while other models demonstrated fair-to-moderate agreement (κ = 0.37–0.61). Surprisingly, open-source models outperformed several commercial counterparts. These results highlight the necessity of expert oversight when integrating GenAI as a support tool in qualitative data analysis. The paper concludes by discussing the methodological implications for using LLMs in qualitative research and proposing specific prompt engineering strategies to enhance their reliability in applied linguistics.},

    abstract = {Digital health interventions offer promise for scalable and accessible health care, but access is still limited by some participatory challenges, especially for disadvantaged families facing limited health literacy, language barriers, low income, or living in marginalized areas. These issues are particularly pronounced for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), who often experience distressing symptoms and struggle with educational materials due to complex jargon, fatigue, or reading level mismatches. To address these issues, we developed and assessed the feasibility of a digital health platform, CRCWeb, to improve the accessibility of educational resources on symptom management for disadvantaged patients with CRC and their caregivers facing limited health literacy or low income. CRCWeb was developed through a stakeholder-centered participatory design approach. Two-phase semistructured interviews with patients, caregivers, and oncology experts informed the iterative design process. From the interviews, we developed the following 5 key design principles: user-friendly navigation, multimedia integration, concise and clear content, enhanced accessibility for individuals with vision and reading disabilities, and scalability for future content expansion. Initial feedback from iterative stakeholder engagements confirmed high user satisfaction, with participants rating CRCWeb an average of 3.98 out of 5 on the postintervention survey. Additionally, using generative artificial intelligence tools, including large language models like ChatGPT and multimedia generation tools such as Pictory, complex health care guidelines were transformed into concise, easily comprehensible multimedia content, and made accessible through CRCWeb. User engagement was notably higher among disadvantaged participants with limited health literacy or low income, who logged into the platform 2.52 times more frequently than nondisadvantaged participants. The structured development approach of CRCWeb demonstrates that generative artificial intelligence–powered multimedia interventions can effectively address health care accessibility barriers faced by disadvantaged patients with CRC and caregivers with limited health literacy or low income. This structured approach highlights how digital innovations can enhance health care.

Chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot based on a LLM at the forefront of technological development with promising applications in medical education. This study aims to evaluate the use of ChatGPT in generating board-style practice questions for radiology resident education.
Materials and Methods
Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were generated by ChatGPT from resident lecture transcripts using a custom prompt. 17 of the ChatGPT-generated MCQs were selected for inclusion in the study and randomly combined with 11 attending radiologist-written MCQs. For each MCQ, the 21 participating radiology residents answered the MCQ, rated the MCQ from 1–10 on effectiveness in reinforcing lecture material, and responded whether they thought an attending radiologist at their institution wrote the MCQ versus an alternative source.
Results
Perceived MCQ quality was not significantly different between ChatGPT-generated (M=6.93, SD=0.29) and attending radiologist-written MCQs (M=7.08, SD=0.51) (p=0.15). MCQ correct answer percentages did not significantly differ between ChatGPT-generated (M=57%, SD=20%) and attending radiologist-written MCQs (M=59%, SD=25%) (p=0.78). The percentage of MCQs thought to be written by an attending radiologist was significantly different between ChatGPT-generated (M=57%, SD=13%) and attending radiologist-written MCQs (M=71%, SD=20%) (p=0.04).
Conclusion
LLMs such as ChatGPT demonstrate potential in generating and presenting educational material for radiology education, and their use should be explored further on a larger scale.},

Notably, there has been an increase in interest in using artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, in the pharmacovigilance of pharmaceuticals under development, as well as those already in the market. This review was conducted to understand how generative AI can play an important role in pharmacovigilance and improving drug safety monitoring. Data from previously published articles and news items were reviewed in order to obtain information. We used PubMed and Google Scholar as our search engines, and keywords (pharmacovigilance, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drug safety, and patient safety) were used. In toto, we reviewed 109 articles published till 31st January 2024, and the obtained information was interpreted, compiled, evaluated, and conclusions were reached. Generative AI has transformative potential in pharmacovigilance, showcasing benefits, such as enhanced adverse event detection, data-driven risk prediction, and optimized drug development. By making it easier to process and analyze big datasets, generative artificial intelligence has applications across a variety of disease states. Machine learning and automation in this field can streamline pharmacovigilance procedures and provide a more efficient way to assess safety-related data. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to determine how this optimization affects the caliber of safety analyses. In the near future, the increased utilization of artificial intelligence is anticipated, especially in predicting side effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs).},

Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) is increasingly being integrated into nursing simulation education; however, little is known about how ICU novice simulation instructors experience using Gen AI for case design.
Methods
A descriptive qualitative approach was employed, utilizing semi-structured interviews with 13 ICU novice simulation instructors who participated in a simulation instructor training program incorporating Gen AI for case design. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes.
Results
Three main themes emerged: (a) Perceived value and benefits; (b) Potential for expansion; and (c) Concerns and limitations.
Conclusion
ICU novice simulation instructors perceive Gen AI as a valuable tool for enhancing case design efficiency and fostering innovative teaching strategies. However, concerns regarding over-reliance on AI, content validation, and ethical considerations must be addressed. Future research should focus on refining AI-assisted simulation case design while maintaining a balance between AI support and instructor-led critical thinking to ensure the quality and sustainability of AI-integrated simulation education.},

    abstract = {For software evolution, user feedback has become a meaningful way to improve applications. Recent studies show a significant increase in analyzing end-user feedback from various social media platforms for software evolution. However, less attention has been given to the end-user feedback for low-rating software applications. Also, such approaches are developed mainly on the understanding of human annotators who might have subconsciously tried for a second guess, questioning the validity of the methods. For this purpose, we proposed an approach that analyzes end-user feedback for low-rating applications to identify the end-user opinion types associated with negative reviews (an issue or bug). Also, we utilized Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., ChatGPT, as an annotator and negotiator when preparing a truth set for the deep learning (DL) classifiers to identify end-user emotion. For the proposed approach, we first used the ChatGPT Application Programming Interface (API) to identify negative end-user feedback by processing 71853 reviews collected from 45 apps in the Amazon store. Next, a novel grounded theory is developed by manually processing end-user negative feedback to identify frequently associated emotion types, including anger, confusion, disgust, distrust, disappointment, fear, frustration, and sadness. Next, two datasets were developed, one with human annotators using a content analysis approach and the other using ChatGPT API with the identified emotion types. Next, another round is conducted with ChatGPT to negotiate over the conflicts with the human-annotated dataset, resulting in a conflict-free emotion detection dataset. Finally, various DL classifiers, including LSTM, BILSTM, CNN, RNN, GRU, BiGRU and BiRNN, are employed to identify their efficacy in detecting end-users emotions by preprocessing the input data, applying feature engineering, balancing the data set, and then training and testing them using a cross-validation approach. We obtained an average accuracy of 94%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, 91%, and 85%, with LSTM, BILSTM, RNN, CNN, GRU, BiGRU and BiRNN, respectively, showing improved results with the truth set curated with human and ChatGPT.

The aim of this study is to examine nursing students' attitudes toward AI use, their patterns of use and levels of AI addiction, as well as to evaluate the impact of emerging fears such as AIlessphobia.
Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving and is increasingly being used among university students. Concepts such as “AIlessphobia” -the fear of being without AI- highlight the emergence of these issues.
Design
This study used a mixed-methods design.
Methods
The study was carried out during the 2024–2025 Spring Semester with nursing students. Data were collected using the Scale for Dependence on Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and semi-structured interview questions. Qualitative interviews were conducted with students who scored 15 or higher on DAI. The quantitative sample consists of 200 students and the qualitative sample was determined based on quantitative and qualitative data.
Results
Most participants (81.5 %) reported using AI tools, with ChatGPT being the most preferred among them. The interview included 13 questions and the themes emerged during the individual interviews. Thematic analysis highlighted five themes: educational benefits, negative effects, AI addiction, future expectations and AIlessphobia. Students noted that AI eased learning but reduced critical thinking and reported emotional distress when deprived of AI access.
Conclusions
The widespread use of AI tools in education produces both positive and negative effects. It is essential for educators to support students in integrating these tools with critical thinking skills and digital awareness. Such support is crucial for preventing AI addiction and AIlessphobia.},

Time-varying transvalvular pressure gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective was to develop a novel machine learning method enhanced by generative artificial intelligence and smart data selection strategies to predict the post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement gradient waveform using preprocedural Doppler echocardiogram.
Methods
A total of 110 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (mean age 78.2 ± 9.0 years, 52.5% female) were included for pressure gradient collection. A deep machine learning model was trained and tested to predict postprocedural pressure gradient waveform from preprocedural pressure gradient waveform based on the proposed generative active learning framework.
Results
The trained model demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 84.85% across the 10 test patients measured from the relative mean absolute error between the predicted gradient waveform and the ground truth. The generative method improved prediction accuracy by 3.11%, whereas the data selection strategy increased it by 16.03% compared with the baseline experimental group using plain machine learning. Additionally, Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated a strong agreement between the proposed method and clinical measurements for both mean and peak pressure gradient predictions.
Conclusions
A deep, generative, active machine learning model was developed to output the prediction of post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement time-varying pressure gradient from the preprocedural time-varying gradient obtained from Doppler echocardiogram. Such a predictive method may help guide decision-making for the prevention of various post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement complications. Further studies are necessary to investigate the gradient change of other valve types.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a noninvasive marker of autonomic nervous system function, has become an increasingly utilized tool in complementary medicine (CM) research for objectively assessing physiological responses to interventions. While specific applications of HRV within individual CM modalities have been reviewed, comprehensive mapping of the broader research landscape remains limited. This bibliometric study aimed to provide a detailed overview of the evolution, key contributors, and thematic development of HRV research across diverse CM interventions between 2005 and 2024.
Methods
Original research articles published between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2024, were retrieved from the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection. A Boolean search strategy combined HRV-related terms with keywords representing a wide range of CM interventions, while deliberately excluding broad or ambiguous descriptors. The data were analyzed using the Bibliometrix package.
Results
A total of 1007 articles published across 375 journals and authored by 4969 individuals were identified, with publication output showing a steady increase and peaking in 2022. China (23.5%) and the United States (19.1%) emerged as the most prolific contributors, although United States publications exhibited a higher average citation rate. Leading institutions included Kyung Hee University (South Korea) and China Medical University (Taiwan). Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine was the most frequent publishing journal. HRV and CM research has increasingly appeared in higher-ranked journals over time (p < 0.001). Keyword co-occurrence analysis positioned HRV as a central term, connecting clusters related to mind-body practices, psychophysiological constructs, music therapy, and electroacupuncture. Thematic evolution analysis revealed recent trends toward greater methodological rigor, increased emphasis on patient-centered outcomes, diversification of CM interventions, and incorporation of emerging digital health technologies.
Conclusion
This bibliometric analysis shows HRV research in CM as an evolving field positioned at the intersection of traditional practices, contemporary physiological science, and technological innovation. Recent trends indicate a shift toward increased methodological rigor, greater emphasis on patient-centered outcomes, and integration of digital technologies. As the field advances, novel technologies such as generative artificial intelligence offer promise for deepening physiological insights and enhancing the clinical relevance of CM applications within mainstream healthcare.},

    abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) represents an increasingly popular topic that is visible even in most research areas within the social sciences and humanities fields. However, little attention has been paid to the knowledge dimensions reflecting the potential macro-social implications of generative technologies. This study utilizes a two-fold methodology, consisting of a bibliometric analysis of articles published in the last decade (N = 484) and a subsequent qualitative thematic review of the most influential articles in each research area (N = 246). The objective is to investigate the main conceptual dimensions associated with generative AI in the social sciences. Applying a thematic analysis framework, we notice that the most popular dimensions are technological, ethical, and social. These dimensions primarily focus on investigating the implications of the generative use of AI on employees in professional sectors as well as on students and teachers in the educational environment. Moreover, the political dimension reflects macro-social consequences on governance and legal components related to ensuring social protection for professions that risk becoming obsolete due to the widespread adoption of ChatGPT-type technologies. Overall, our research emphasizes concrete scholarly tensions through which generative AI-based technologies are predominantly encouraged in the educational and organizational sectors, but the potential risks associated with copyright infringement and job loss might constitute important drivers of social change. We also notice that a Foucauldian power/knowledge framework would prove useful in understanding the underdiscussed effects of generative AI on the societal/macro level.},

    abstract = {Context
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized tasks that previously required significant human effort, which has attracted considerable interest from industry stakeholders. This growing interest has accelerated the integration of AI models into various industrial applications. However, the model integration introduces challenges to product quality, as conventional quality measuring methods may fail to assess GenAI systems. Consequently, evaluation techniques for GenAI systems need to be adapted and refined. Examining the current state and applicability of evaluation techniques for the GenAI system outputs is essential.
Objective
This study aims to explore the current metrics, methods, and processes for assessing the outputs of GenAI systems and the potential of risky outputs.
Method
We performed a snowballing literature review to identify metrics, evaluation methods, and evaluation processes from 43 selected papers.
Results
We identified 28 metrics and mapped these metrics to four quality characteristics defined by the ISO/IEC 25023 standard for software systems. Additionally, we discovered three types of evaluation methods to measure the quality of system outputs and a three-step process to assess faulty system outputs. Based on these insights, we suggested a five-step framework for measuring system quality while utilizing GenAI models.
Conclusion
Our findings present a mapping that visualizes candidate metrics to be selected for measuring quality characteristics of GenAI systems, accompanied by step-by-step processes to assist practitioners in conducting quality assessments.},

Unequal learning preparation commonly exists among learners with varying socioeconomic and academic backgrounds, and can further exacerbate the educational divide. By reducing learning cost and providing less prepared learners with personalized delivery of information and knowledge, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) may help mitigate disparities in learning preparation. In this study, we investigate the roles of learners' use of GenAI in their learning processes, considering varying levels of learners’ prior learning preparation and proficiency in GenAI use. Specifically, we examine the effects of the use of GenAI tools on learning outcomes through its impacts on perceived informational benefit, learning cost, and knowledge fit in the focal learning process, moderated by learning preparation and GenAI proficiency of learners. Based on an experiment in a programming learning context, we find that although GenAI use significantly reduces learning cost, especially for less prepared learners, the cost reduction effect has not been translated into improved learning outcomes. We find no significant moderating effects of learning preparation on how GenAI use affects informational benefit and knowledge fit, further showing that GenAI tools have not yet been effectively utilized to help less prepared learners or reduce the educational divide. As indicated by the significant moderating roles of GenAI proficiency, to fully leverage the power of GenAI, improving GenAI proficiency can be crucial to ensure learning effectiveness for learners with different levels of learning preparation.},

However, healthcare professionals often harbor concerns about AI-related job displacement, data security, and ethical implications, creating a perceived AI threat that may impede its widespread adoption. This study integrates the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with perceived AI threat as both a direct and moderating factor, thereby examining how threat perceptions interact with established adoption drivers in the context of healthcare in Vietnam. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 573 healthcare professionals from major hospitals across Hanoi, Vietnam. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was employed to test the proposed framework, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), and perceived AI threat. The results indicate that PE, EE, and SI had significant positive effects on behavioral intention, whereas FC was not a significant predictor. Perceived AI threat demonstrated a strong negative impact on adoption intentions, particularly by moderating and weakening the positive effects of PE and SI. The model explained 79.8 % of the variance in AI adoption intention, suggesting a substantial predictive power. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of addressing existential fears regarding AI in healthcare. Interventions targeting user training, transparent communication, and regulatory support may help mitigate perceived threats and harness AI's benefits.

Climate change and multifaceted energy crises necessitate resilient power systems for sustainable and smart energy transitions. However, correlations among energy efficiency, energy reliability, robustness, flexibility, and energy resilience remain unclear. This review employs bibliometric analysis to evaluate AI-driven solutions, particularly generative AI, in enhancing urban energy resilience. We quantify energy resilience metrics, as well as highlight the synergy among energy efficiency, energy reliability, robustness, flexibility, energy resilience with carbon neutrality, and multi-sector strategies across supply, demand, storage, and grid systems. The analysis demonstrates the capacity of AI to improve climate change adaptation during extreme events, illustrated as bio-inspired frameworks that emulate human self-regulation and self-healing. The integration of end-user participation and techno-economic-social benefits are emphasized. Big data technology facilitates information communications and inter-component interactions, while generative AI enables automatic city-scale information modeling and real-time decision-making. To conclude, we highlight challenges in smart energy transitions and suggest pathways to harmonize resilience with energy efficiency and reliability under climate challenges.},

    abstract = {Surveys and interviews—structured, semi-structured, or unstructured—are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. For example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents. This issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying AI agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. We believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research.},

This study aims to evaluate the performance of ScholarGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM) developed for academic purposes, on questions related to dental avulsion. In addition, to analyze and compare it with the results of the previous study evaluating the performance of ChatGPT and Gemini.
Method
A total of 22 technical questions (11 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), 11 true/false (T/F)) were posed to the ScholarGPT. ScholarGPT responses were assessed using a modified Global Quality Scale (GQS). Responses were randomized using an online randomizer (www.randomizer.org) before scoring. A single researcher carried out the assessments at three different times, two weeks apart, and a new randomization was performed before each scoring.
Results
When the answers given by ScholarGPT according to the question groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test, the mean value was found to be 4.64 for MCQ questions and 4.82 for T/F questions. ScholarGPT provided similarly high-quality and consistent answers in both question types (p = 0.590). When the performance of ScholarGPT was compared with Gemini and ChatGPT via the Friedman test, the mean score of ScholarGPT responses was significantly higher than both ChatGPT and Gemini (mean difference with Gemini = 0.75; mean difference with ChatGPT = 1.62, p < 0.001). ScholarGPT produced statistically significantly more consistent and higher-quality responses than ChatGPT and Gemini.
Conclusion
ScholarGPT showed high performance on technical questions related to dental avulsion and produced more consistent and higher-quality answers than ChatGPT and Gemini. According to the findings, LLMs based on academic databases can provide more accurate and reliable information. In the future, through the development of LLMs specific to the branches of dentistry, artificial intelligence systems can produce higher quality and consistent information.},

With the rapid development and iteration of generative artificial intelligence, the growing popularity of such groundbreaking tools among nurse researchers, represented by ChatGPT (OpenAI), is receiving passionate debate and intrigue. Although there has been qualitative research on generative artificial intelligence in other fields, little is known about the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers; this study seeks to report on the topic.
Objective
This study aimed to describe the experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese nurse researchers, as well as provide a reference for the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research in the future.
Methods
Semistructured interviews were used to collect data in this qualitative study. Researchers mainly conducted interviews on the cognition, experience, and future expectations of nurse researchers regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence. Twenty-seven nurse researchers were included in the study. Through purposive sampling and snowball sampling, there were 7 nursing faculty researchers, 10 nursing graduate students, and 10 clinical nurse researchers. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis.
Results
Five themes and 12 subthemes were categorized from 27 original interview documents as follows: (1) diverse reflections on human-machine symbiosis, which includes the interplay between substitution and assistance, researchers shaping the potential of generative artificial intelligence, and acceptance of generative artificial intelligence with alacrity; (2) multiple factors of the usage experience, including individual characteristics and various usage scenarios; (3) research paradigm reshaping in the infancy stage, which involves full-process groundbreaking assistive tools and emergence of new research paths; (4) application risks of generative artificial intelligence, including intrinsic limitations of generative artificial intelligence and academic integrity and medical ethics; and (5) the co-improvement of technology and literacy, which concerns reinforcement needs for generative artificial intelligence literacy, development of nursing research generative artificial intelligence and urgent need for artificial intelligence–generated content detection tools. In this context, the first 4 themes form the rocket of the human-machine symbiosis journey. Only when humans fully leverage the advantages of machines (generative artificial intelligence) and overcome their shortcomings can this human-machine symbiosis journey reach the correct future direction (fifth theme).
Conclusions
This study explored the experiences and perceptions of nurse researchers interacting with generative artificial intelligence, which was a “symbiotic journey” full of twists and turns, and provides a reference and basis for achieving harmonious coexistence between nurse researchers and generative artificial intelligence in the future. Nurse researchers, policy makers, and application developers can use the conclusions of this study to further promote the application of generative artificial intelligence in nursing research, policy making, and product development.},

    abstract = {Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.},

From this point of view, this study presents how to solve computer-aided design (CAD) problems using GenAI-human collaboration, where a GenAI tool generates structured code (syntax) for CAD while a designer articulates the design intent (semantics). The focus is to see how the information type, model complexity, and prompt structure collectively affect the collaboration. A set of case studies demonstrate that a modular modeling approach with low-level information improves prompt efficiency and modeling accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. This strategy also enables novice and expert users to collaborate with GenAI in solving challenging real-world CAD tasks effectively. The findings support the development of advanced human-AI co-creation systems and encourage future research in areas such as reverse engineering, multi-part assemblies, and collaborative CAD workflows coupled with complex design constraints.},

Binary and ordered logit regression models are estimated for the actual AI chatbot use. The results show that the older, the less educated and women lag behind in the use of this new technology. In addition, users who make greater use of other digital technologies are also more likely to use generative AI.

@article{NEGRON2025194,
    abstract = {Background:
In EULAR 2020, the results of our ongoing project Reumasutra were presented. The aims were to (i) understand the complexities and the difficulties of sexuality in people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), (ii) offer a solution to the problems previously identified, and (iii) (un)validate the proposed solution using feedback of people with RMDs [1]. However, we were forced to pause the last phase of the project due to diverse challenges been the most influential the development of generative artificial intelligence and its potential use for creating deepfakes. This technology brought with it ethical challenges. Therefore, we wanted to be sure how we could best protect the dignity of the individuals who trusted us by participating in the explicit audiovisual shorts, which involved recreating adapted sexual positions for people with RMDs. While considering the best options available, we decided that the topic of sexuality and sex in RMDs was too important to be put on hold for an extended period. Therefore, we chose to expand Reumasutra by creating a documentary for people of all ages, aimed at making the taboo topic of sexuality and sex in RMDs visible and accessible to the general population.
Objectives:
To create a documentary for the general population on sexuality and sex in RMDs in order to raise awareness of this taboo topic.
Methods:
For this work, our ontological and epistemological assumptions stand by the constructivist/interpretivist paradigm which establishes that there are multiple subjective realities, each of which is socially constructed by and between individuals. The creation of the documentary was approached using qualitative research methodology and methods. Narrative interviews were used as the method of data collection. Interviews were moderated by the same researcher which was assisted by an audiovisual team in charge of recording the interviews and subsequent audiovisual editing of the final piece. A total of 10 interviews (eight with women), conducted in Catalan, Spanish, and English, took place in February 2024 in Barcelona, Spain. Seven of the interviews were with individuals with RMDs (such as axial spondylarthritis, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and pulmonary sarcoidosis, among others), and the remaining interviews were with health professionals or patient advocates. It is important to note that some of the individuals interviewed held more than one role, being both people with RMDs and healthcare professionals or patient advocates. After data collection, a qualitative content analysis was performed.
Results:
Our main result is the documentary (approximate duration of 50 minutes) in which four main topics were generated and could be appreciated in more depth. Although sexuality and sex were the primary focus of our work, the narrative interviews revealed important issues that we were previously unaware of, which may also be invisible to the general population. The four main topics are: (i) structural violence and microaggressions against women, (ii) lack of education on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within the medical community, (iii) the formation of a new identity after diagnosis, and (iv) women's bodies as factories for producing life.
Conclusion:
There is an invisibility of women in medicine. Just as sexuality and sex in RMDs are not a local problem but a global one, we believe this invisibility is also a global issue. Sociocultural variables and dynamics (e.g., religious practices) play a role in the magnitude of this issue across different countries. Structural violence and various types of aggression were identified in the experiences of the women who participated, which was not the case for the men interviewed. DEI education is needed in medical training to counterbalance this violence. New meaning in the lives of the participants was found through collective activities that created bonds with different communities. However, there is a reproductive reductionism in rheumatology when the topic of sexuality and sex is addressed with women. Our results serve as an invitation for everyone involved in the diagnosis and treatment of RMDs to reflect on our practices, their origins, and ask ourselves: Are there better ways?

    abstract = {Purpose
The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into scientific research and academic writing has generated considerable controversy. Currently, standards for using GAI in academic medicine remain undefined. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the guidance provided for authors regarding the use of GAI in ophthalmology scientific journals.
Design
Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis.
Participants
A total of 140 ophthalmology journals listed in the Scimago Journal and Country Rankings, regardless of language or origin.
Methods
We systematically searched and screened the 140 ophthalmology journals’ websites on October 19 and 20, 2024, and conducted updates on November 19 and 20, 2024.
Main Outcome Measures
The content of GAI guidelines from the websites of the 140 ophthalmology journals.
Results
Of 140 journals reviewed, 96 (69%) provide explicit guidelines for authors regarding the use of GAI. Among these, nearly all journals agree on 3 key points: (1) 94 journals (98%) have established specific guidelines prohibiting GAI from being listed as an author; (2) 94 journals (98%) emphasize that human authors are responsible for the outputs generated by GAI tools; and (3) all 96 journals require authors to disclose any use of GAI. In addition, 20 journals (21%) specify that their guidelines pertain solely to the writing process with GAI. Furthermore, 92 journals (66%) have developed guidelines concerning GAI-generated images, with 63 journals (68%) permitting their use and 29 (32%) prohibiting them. Among those that prohibit GAI images, 27 journals (93%) allow their use under specific conditions.
Conclusion
Although there is considerable ethical consensus among ophthalmology journals regarding the use of GAI, notable variations exist in terms of permissible use and disclosure practices. Establishing standardized guidelines is essential to safeguard the originality and integrity of scientific research. Researchers must uphold high standards of academic ethics and integrity when using GAI.},

Through written reflections, an optimistic outlook on GenAI's role in education was identified among the teachers, and some discipline-specific ideas were proposed. Thematic analysis reveals three key practices of AI implementation: teaching/learning, administration and assessments. However, three major challenges are also identified: school's readiness, teachers' AI competencies, and students' AI literacy and ethics. Teachers suggest several strategies to motivate GenAI integration, including professional development, clear guidelines, and access to AI software and technical support. Finally, Singh's Teach AI Global Initiative Guidance and Socio-ecological Model are adapted and proposed to support schools in becoming AI-ready by addressing teachers' and students' needs, facilitating organizational learning, and promoting improvement and transformation to foster their literacy development. Recommendations were provided for developing effective strategies to embrace GenAI in education.},

Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.},

    abstract = {Background
The recent introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as an interactive consultant has sparked interest in evaluating its applicability in medical discussions and consultations, particularly within the domain of depression.
Objective
This study evaluates the capability of large language models (LLMs) in AI to generate responses to depression-related queries.
Methods
Using the PubMedQA and QuoraQA data sets, we compared various LLMs, including BioGPT, PMC-LLaMA, GPT-3.5, and Llama2, and measured the similarity between the generated and original answers.
Results
The latest general LLMs, GPT-3.5 and Llama2, exhibited superior performance, particularly in generating responses to medical inquiries from the PubMedQA data set.
Conclusions
Considering the rapid advancements in LLM development in recent years, it is hypothesized that version upgrades of general LLMs offer greater potential for enhancing their ability to generate “knowledge text” in the biomedical domain compared with fine-tuning for the biomedical field. These findings are expected to contribute significantly to the evolution of AI-based medical counseling systems.},

@article{SATO2025,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has shown rapid advancements and increasing applications in various domains, including health care. Previous studies have evaluated AI performance on medical license examinations, primarily focusing on ChatGPT. However, the availability of new online chat-based large language models (OC-LLMs) and their potential utility in pharmacy licensing examinations remain underexplored. Considering that pharmacists require a broad range of expertise in physics, chemistry, biology, and pharmacology, verifying the knowledge base and problem-solving abilities of these new models in Japanese pharmacy examinations is necessary.
Objective
This study aimed to assess the performance of 18 OC-LLMs released in 2024 in the 107th Japanese National License Examination for Pharmacists (JNLEP). Specifically, the study compared their accuracy and identified areas of improvement relative to earlier models.
Methods
The 107th JNLEP, comprising 345 questions in Japanese, was used as a benchmark. Each OC-LLM was prompted by the original text-based questions, and images were uploaded where permitted. No additional prompt engineering or English translation was performed. For questions that included diagrams or chemical structures, the models incapable of image input were considered incorrect. The model outputs were compared with publicly available correct answers. The overall accuracy rates were calculated based on subject area (pharmacology and chemistry) and question type (text-only, diagram-based, calculation, and chemical structure). Fleiss’ κ was used to measure answer consistency among the top-performing models.
Results
Four flagship models—ChatGPT o1, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (new), and Perplexity Pro—achieved 80% accuracy, surpassing the official passing threshold and average examinee score. A significant improvement in the overall accuracy was observed between the early and the latest 2024 models. Marked improvements were noted in text-only and diagram-based questions compared with those of earlier versions. However, the accuracy of chemistry-related and chemical structure questions remains relatively low. Fleiss’ κ among the 4 flagship models was 0.334, which suggests moderate consistency but highlights variability in more complex questions.
Conclusions
OC-LLMs have substantially improved their capacity to handle Japanese pharmacists’ examination content, with several newer models achieving accuracy rates of >80%. Despite these advancements, even the best-performing models exhibit an error rate exceeding 10%, underscoring the ongoing need for careful human oversight in clinical settings. Overall, the 107th JNLEP will serve as a valuable benchmark for current and future generative AI evaluations in pharmacy licensing examinations.},

@article{SUPPAN2025,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is showing great promise as a tool to optimize decision-making across various fields, including medicine. In anesthesiology, accurately calculating maximum safe doses of local anesthetics (LAs) is crucial to prevent complications such as local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Current methods for determining LA dosage are largely based on empirical guidelines and clinician experience, which can result in significant variability and dosing errors. AI models may offer a solution, by processing multiple parameters simultaneously to suggest adequate LA doses.
Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 generative AI models, ChatGPT (OpenAI), Copilot (Microsoft Corporation), and Gemini (Google LLC), in calculating maximum safe LA doses, with the goal of determining their potential use in clinical practice.
Methods
A comparative analysis was conducted using a 51-item questionnaire designed to assess LA dose calculation across 10 simulated clinical vignettes. The responses generated by ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini were compared with reference doses calculated using a scientifically validated set of rules. Quantitative evaluations involved comparing AI-generated doses to these reference doses, while qualitative assessments were conducted by independent reviewers using a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
All 3 AI models (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot) completed the questionnaire and generated responses aligned with LA dose calculation principles, but their performance in providing safe doses varied significantly. Gemini frequently avoided proposing any specific dose, instead recommending consultation with a specialist. When it did provide dose ranges, they often exceeded safe limits by 140% (SD 103%) in cases involving mixtures. ChatGPT provided unsafe doses in 90% (9/10) of cases, exceeding safe limits by 198% (SD 196%). Copilot’s recommendations were unsafe in 67% (6/9) of cases, exceeding limits by 217% (SD 239%). Qualitative assessments rated Gemini as “fair” and both ChatGPT and Copilot as “poor.”
Conclusions
Generative AI models like Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot currently lack the accuracy and reliability needed for safe LA dose calculation. Their poor performance suggests that they should not be used as decision-making tools for this purpose. Until more reliable AI-driven solutions are developed and validated, clinicians should rely on their expertise, experience, and a careful assessment of individual patient factors to guide LA dosing and ensure patient safety.},

@article{MUNIR2025102439,
    abstract = {Objective
The current study assessed pharmacy students' perceptions about generative AI before and after participation in a ChatGPT-based drug information activity.
Methods
In 2024, students at three colleges of pharmacy completed a baseline and post-activity survey on their perceptions of ChatGPT including its reliability, usefulness, and impact on academic performance and critical thinking. The survey was modified from the TAME-ChatGPT assessment and used a 5-point Likert scale. After the baseline survey, students answered clinically relevant drug information questions on their own using primary or tertiary resources and compared their answers with ChatGPT responses. Independent t-test samples were used to compare baseline and post-activity surveys.
Results
A total of 227 students completed the pre-survey and 203 students completed the post-survey. Students' concerns about the reliability of ChatGPT increased after completing the drug information activity (pre-survey: 3.57 ± 0.96; post-survey: 3.88 ± 1.11; p = 0.002). Students' concerns about reliance on ChatGPT and prevention of critical thinking increased (pre-survey: 3.30 ± 1.34; post-survey: 3.57 ± 1.21; p = 0.031). The following areas decreased after the activity: enthusiasm about ChatGPT as learning and research tool (pre-survey: 3.60 ± 1.02; post-survey: 3.32 ± 1.18; p = 0.008), viewing ChatGPT as an important tool for academic success (pre-survey: 3.40 ± 1.13; post-survey: 3.12 ± 1.23; p = 0.015), and concern regarding being accused of plagiarism when using ChatGPT(pre-survey: 4.12 ± 0.96; post-survey: 3.91 ± 1.10; p = 0.031). Open-ended responses revealed that students largely perceived ChatGPT as unreliable for drug information, citing concerns about accuracy and outdated content. However, some students noted its potential usefulness for non-clinical tasks such as generating ideas, organizing content, or providing general overviews.
Conclusion
After a hands-on ChatGPT-based drug information activity, pharmacy students reported increased concerns about reliability and over-reliance on artificial intelligence-based technology. The results of this study may encourage pharmacy educators to implement classroom activities for active exploration of the benefits and challenges of generative AI.
Contribution to literature
Limited published data describes pharmacy student perceptions of artificial intelligence platforms as a drug information source. There is even less literature with pre- and post-data after implementing an activity in which students gain hands-on experience critiquing an artificial intelligence platform response. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate student perceptions after using ChatGPT in the classroom and comparing its performance to their own responses based on information from primary and tertiary literature. The results demonstrate that despite enthusiasm before using ChatGPT, concerns for reliability and hindering thinking increased after a observing the limitations of its performance in answering drug information questions.},

    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly emerged as a promising tool in health care. Despite its growing adoption, how physicians make use of it in medical practice has not been qualitatively studied. Existing literature has largely focused on theoretical applications or experimental validations, with limited insight into real-world physician engagement with GenAI technologies.
Objective
The aim of this study was to leverage a fine-grained dataset at the query level to quantitatively examine how physicians incorporate GenAI into their clinical and research workflows. The primary objective was to analyze usage patterns over time and across physician demographics. A secondary goal was to assess potential risks to patient privacy arising from physicians’ interactions with GenAI platforms.
Methods
This study collected 106,942 query-and-answer pairs by 989 physicians between August 29, 2023, and April 16, 2024. We performed topic classification to identify the most prevalent use cases, examining how these use cases evolved over time and across demographics. We also developed sensitivity classifiers to detect personally identifiable information in physicians’ queries to explore the potential privacy breach risks around physicians’ use of GenAI.
Results
Approximately 40% (396/989) of the enrolled physicians were female, 45.9% (454/989) were younger than 25 years, and 54.1% (535/989) were between 25 and 56 years of age. The majority of them worked in clinical departments (680/989, 68.8%) or medical technology departments (127/989, 12.8%). Our classification-based quantitative analyses suggest the following. First, physicians use GenAI predominantly for medical research (64,379/106,942, 60.2%) rather than clinical practice (13,100/106,942, 12.25%). Second, physicians focus more on health care–related questions (rising from 64,165/106,942, 60% to 83,415/106,942, 78%) within the first 15% (16,041/106,942) of their query sequence. Third, the use of GenAI differed across physician demographics and features. Specifically, female physicians asked a larger proportion of clinical questions (female: 0.154 vs male: 0.108; P<.001) and administration questions (female: 0.027 vs male: 0.018; P<.001) than male physicians; younger physicians posed more clinical questions (age ≤25: 0.146 vs age ∈ (25, 40]: 0.115 vs age >40: 0.103; P<.001) but fewer research questions (age ≤25: 0.580 vs age ∈ (25, 40]: 0.607 vs age >40: 0.664; P<.001) than senior physicians; and physicians accessing GenAI via computers asked more research questions (computer: 0.637 vs mobile: 0.296; P<.001), whereas physicians using mobile devices asked more clinical questions (computer: 0.107 vs mobile: 0.264; P<.001). Fourth, only 2.68% (2866/106,942) of physician queries contained sensitive information, the majority of which were primarily derived from writing and editing.
Conclusions
Physicians are actively integrating GenAI into their professional routines, primarily leveraging it for research but also increasingly for clinical support. Usage patterns vary significantly across demographic lines, including gender, age, and device preference. Despite the presence of sensitive information in some queries, the risk of privacy breaches appears to be low.},

However, methods for identifying players’ post-game experiences in the early stages have received far less attention than those for in-game experiences. In this study, we explored the potential of using measurements from wearable physiological sensors to predict players’ post–VR game experiences. The methods employed were correlation analyses and machine learning techniques. The results showed that electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements, particularly the mean EDA and mean EDA peak, are associated with players’ post-VR game experiences after accounting for noise. By utilizing machine learning technology, physiological metrics can forecast players’ diverse reactions after playing VR games with high accuracy. The symptoms of depersonalization/derealization experienced after VR gaming are attributed to being induced by actions within the virtual environment. This research makes significant contributions to the field of user experience recognition and the progression of VR gaming by demonstrating the potential for future VR game centers to analyze player emotions remotely and cost-effectively. This achievement provides the prerequisite for these centers to create tailored new 3D game scenarios to enhance players’ post-game experiences with the support of future advanced generative artificial intelligence technologies.},

    abstract = {Purpose
This article examines a lesson study (LS) approach bringing teachers and university faculty together to develop a lesson in data literacy using transformative technologies, including Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) such as ChatGPT.
Design/methodology/approach
An LS team with four teachers from a private school, facilitated by three researchers, conducted two iterations of LS on teaching scatterplots using technologies. Multiple data were collected: Videos of research lessons, videos of lesson planning and post-lesson debriefings, and post-LS focus student group and teacher interviews. Based on an enriched LS framework (Lewis, 2016), this study investigates both students’ and teachers’ learning.
Findings
The students learned new concepts and skills to investigate contextual problems using technologies through the data literacy cycle. Teachers developed an understanding of relevant statistical concepts and pedagogical content knowledge needed for teaching the topic in a technology-rich environment. Teachers realized the potential of using Gen-AI for planning lessons and were eager to explore the effective use of Gen-AI further. Meanwhile, some challenges in using Gen-AI in LS were identified.
Research limitations/implications
This study focuses on both teachers’ and students’ perceived learning based on interview data. However, the integration of classroom teaching data and debriefing data could provide a richer picture of their learning processes.
Practical implications
This study demonstrates how data literacy could be taught through addressing contextual problems using various technologies, revealing both positive effects and associated challenges.
Originality/value
The study contributes to a better understanding of how transformative technology like Gen-AI could be incorporated into LS to strengthen teachers’ and students’ learning.},

    abstract = {Background
Although generative-AI systems are increasingly used to solve non-routine problems, effective prompting strategies remain largely underexplored.
Aims
The present study investigates how university students prompt ChatGPT to solve complex ill-defined problems, specifically examining which prompts are associated with higher or lower problem-solving performance.
Sample
Seventy-seven university students (53 women; Mage = 22.4 years) participated in the study.
Methods
To identify various prompt types employed by students, the study utilized qualitative analysis of interactions with ChatGPT 3.5 during the resolution of the creative problem-solving task. Participants’ performance was measured by the quality, elaboration, and originality of their ideas. Subsequently, two-step clustering was employed to identify groups of low- and high-performing students. Finally, process-mining techniques (heuristics miner) were used to analyze the interactions of low- and high-performing students.
Results
The findings suggest that including clear evaluation criteria when prompting ChatGPT to generate ideas (rs = .38), providing ChatGPT with an elaborated context for idea generation (rs = .47), and offering specific feedback (rs = .45), enhances the quality, elaboration, and originality of the solutions. Successful problem-solving involves iterative human-AI regulation, with high performers using an overall larger number of prompts (d = .82). High performers interacted with ChatGPT through dialogue, where they monitored and regulated the generation of ideas, while low performers used ChatGPT as an information resource.
Conclusions
These results emphasize the importance of active and iterative engagement for creative problem-solving and suggest that educational practices should foster metacognitive monitoring and regulation to maximize the benefits of human-AI collaboration.},

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can help to predict and visualize the results of skin laser treatments, improving patient consultations in cosmetic dermatology. However, existing generative adversarial networks (GANs) often struggle to produce diverse, realistic images due to issues such as mode collapse, primarily caused by low-entropy noise inputs from software-based pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). Here, we introduce a conditional GAN (cGAN) framework empowered with a quantized-memristive true-random number generator (Q-mTRNG). The Q-mTRNG utilizes a Cu nanoscale filament formed inside a high-crosslinking-density polymer film to generate high-entropy, true random numbers via reliable quantum point contact. This enhanced entropy enables the cGAN to explore its latent space, generating diverse, realistic post-skin treatment images based on pre-treatment photographs.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Over 90% of pregnant women and 76% expectant fathers search for pregnancy health information. We examined readability, accuracy and quality of answers to common obstetric anesthesia questions from the popular generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots ChatGPT and Bard.
Methods
Twenty questions for generative AI chatbots were derived from frequently asked questions based on professional society, hospital and consumer websites. ChatGPT and Bard were queried in November 2023. Answers were graded for accuracy by four obstetric anesthesiologists. Quality was measured using Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Print (PEMAT). Readability was measured using six readability indices. Accuracy, quality and readability were compared using independent t-test.
Results
Bard readability scores were high school level, significantly easier than ChatGPT’s college level by all scoring metrics (P <0.001). Bard had significantly longer answers (P <0.001), yet with similar accuracy of Bard (85% ± 10) and ChatGPT (87% ± 14) (P=0.5). PEMAT understandability scores were no statistically significantly different (P=0.06). Actionability by PEMAT scores for Bard was significantly higher (22% vs. 9%) than ChatGPT (P=0.007)
Conclusion
Answers to questions about “labor epidurals” should be accurate, high quality, and easy to read. Bard at high school reading level, was well above the goal 4th to 6th grade level suggested for patient materials. Consumers, health care providers, hospitals and governmental agencies should be aware of the quality of information generated by chatbots. Chatbots should meet the standards for readability and understandability of health-related questions, to aid public understanding and enhance shared decision-making.},

@article{NISHISAKO2025,
    abstract = {Background
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to find information. Providing accurate information is essential to support patients with cancer and their families; however, information returned by generative AIs is sometimes wrong. Returning wrong information is called hallucination. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which supplements large language model (LLM) outputs with relevant external sources, has the potential to reduce hallucinations. Although RAG has been proposed as a promising technique, its real-world performance in public health communication remains underexplored.
Objective
This study aimed to examine cancer information returned by generative AIs with RAG using cancer-specific information sources and general internet searches to determine whether using RAG with reliable information sources reduces the hallucination rates of generative AI chatbots.
Methods
We developed 6 types of chatbots by combining 3 patterns of reference information with 2 versions of LLMs. Thus, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 chatbots that use cancer information service (CIS) information, Google information, and no reference information (conventional chatbots) were developed. A total of 62 cancer-related questions in Japanese were compiled from public sources. All responses were generated automatically and independently reviewed by 2 experienced clinicians. The reviewers assessed the presence of hallucinations, defined as medically harmful or misinformation. We compared hallucination rates across chatbot types and calculated odds ratios (OR) using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Subgroup analyses were also performed based on whether questions were covered by CIS content.
Results
For the chatbots that used information from CIS, the hallucination rates were 0% for GPT-4 and 6% for GPT-3.5, whereas those for chatbots that used information from Google were 6% and 10% for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, respectively. For questions on information that is not issued by CIS, the hallucination rates for Google-based chatbots were 19% for GPT-4 and 35% for GPT-3.5. The hallucination rates for conventional chatbots were approximately 40%. Using reference data from Google searches generated more hallucinations than using CIS data, with an OR of 9.4 (95% CI 1.2‐17.5, P<.01); the OR for the conventional chatbot was 16.1 (95% CI 3.7‐50.0, P<.001). While conventional chatbots always generated a response, the RAG-based chatbots sometimes declined to answer when information was lacking. The conventional chatbots responded to all questions, but the response rate decreased (36% to 81%) for RAG-based chatbots. For questions on information not covered by CIS, the CIS chatbots did not respond, while the Google chatbots generated responses in 52% of the cases for GPT-4 and 71% for GPT-3.5.
Conclusions
Using RAG with reliable information sources significantly reduces the hallucination rate of generative AI chatbots and increases the ability to admit lack of information, making them more suitable for general use, where users need to be provided with accurate information.},

    abstract = {The rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has catalyzed a profound epistemic shift in how creativity is conceptualized, practiced, and structured within socio-technical systems. As GenAI systems increasingly act not merely as facilitators but as co-creators, they blur traditional boundaries between human and machine agency, raising critical questions about originality, authorship, and creative labor. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes 137 peer-reviewed articles (2023–2025) to map the evolving intersection of GenAI and human creativity, with a specific focus on implications for adaptive and personalized learning environments. Integrating Structural Topic Modeling (STM) with a meta-thematic synthesis, we identify twelve latent topics and five higher-order meta-themes: co-creation in design and aesthetics; GenAI-supported education and future skills; cognitive augmentation and creative reasoning; organizational knowledge work and market narratives; and ethical tensions surrounding copyright, bias, and representation. Our findings reveal that GenAI not only augments but transforms creativity, redistributing agency, reshaping evaluation criteria, and redefining the loci of value creation in socio-technical systems. These transformations carry significant implications for learner engagement, instructional design, and curriculum personalization. We advance five cross-cutting constructs including prompt literacy, distributed agency, ethical tensions, methodological gaps, and governance futures that collectively reframe creativity and learning in the GenAI era. The paper culminates in a conceptual framework and a future-oriented research agenda, offering theoretically generative and practically actionable insights for educators, designers, researchers, and policymakers seeking to harness GenAI for adaptive and personalized education.},

    abstract = {Introduction
Pesticides play a pivotal role in ensuring food security, and the development of green pesticides is an inevitable trend in global agricultural progress. Although deep learning-based generative models have revolutionized de novo drug design in pharmaceutical research, their application in pesticide research and development remains unexplored.
Objectives
This study aims to pioneer the application of generative artificial intelligence to pesticide design by proposing a reinforcement learning-based framework for obtaining pesticide-like molecules with high binding affinity.
Methods
This framework comprises two key components: PestiGen-G, which systematically explores the pesticide-like chemical space using a character-based generative model coupled with the REINFORCE algorithm; and PestiGen-S, which combines a fragment-based generative model with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to generate molecules that stably bind to the specific target protein.
Results
Experimental results show that the molecules generated by PestiGen have superior pesticide-likeness and binding affinity compared to those generated by existing methods. In addition, we employ an active learning strategy to reduce the false-positive rate of the generated molecules. Finally, through collaboration with domain experts, we successfully designed a novel 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor (YH23768) with favorable enzyme inhibition and herbicidal potency.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study highlights the utility of PestiGen as a valuable tool for pesticide design. The web server based on the model is freely available at https://dpai.ccnu.edu.cn/PestiGen/.},

Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across disciplines such as chemistry, mathematics, and medicine, yet their application in power system research remains limited, and most studies still focus on supporting specific tasks under human supervision. Here, we introduce Revive Power Systems (RePower), an autonomous LLM-driven research platform that uses a reflection-evolution strategy to independently conduct complex research in power systems. RePower assists researchers by controlling devices, acquiring data, designing methods, and evolving algorithms to address problems that are difficult to solve but easy to evaluate. Validated on three critical data-driven tasks in power systems—parameter prediction, power optimization, and state estimation—RePower outperformed traditional methods. Consistent performance improvements were observed across multiple tasks, with an average error reduction of 29.07%. For example, in the power optimization task, the error decreased from 0.00137 to 0.000825, a reduction of 39.78%. This framework facilitates autonomous discoveries, promoting innovation in power systems research.},

This study innovatively integrates chemical sensors with generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to construct a research paradigm for the intelligent design of lung cancer-specific receptors and the optimization of sensor interfaces. In terms of technological innovation, on one hand, an electrochemical sensing system based on nano-composite materials and an optical enhancement detection platform are built to achieve ultra-trace detection of lung cancer markers, aiming to break through the sensitivity bottleneck of traditional methods; on the other hand, multi-modal generative models are utilized to deeply mine multi-omics data, designing intelligent receptors with topological adaptability, significantly improving the accuracy and binding efficiency of biomolecule recognition. Clinical validation results show that this technology greatly enhances diagnostic efficacy in early lung cancer screening, and personalized treatment strategies based on AI effectively extend patient survival. In terms of technical translation and application, the developed portable detection devices and wearable monitoring technologies can reduce detection costs, providing a widely applicable screening solution for areas with limited medical resources. The study also reveals core challenges such as the explainability of generative AI and the environmental stability of sensors, proposing forward-looking directions such as quantum-biological interface integration and biomimetic adaptive sensing. This research establishes a new paradigm of "intelligent perception - dynamic optimization - precise intervention" for early lung cancer diagnosis, with significant clinical translational value.},

    abstract = {This study provides an evidence-based integrated appraisal of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated deepfakes by integrating a cross-disciplinary literature synthesis with original opinion-poll evidence from seven European countries. A SWOT matrix distils convergent concerns—weaponised disinformation, privacy erosion, and the detection arms race—alongside under-explored opportunities in education, therapy, and creative industries. To test whether these scholarly themes resonate with citizens, a computer-assisted web survey (N = 7,083) measured perceived risks and benefits across 10 specific scenarios for each theme. Correspondence analysis and Bonferroni-adjusted means reveal a pronounced age gradient for benefits, whereas risk perceptions vary by country—younger cohorts are noticeably less alarmed only in Sweden, France, and Czechia. Geographically, Dutch, German, British, and Italian publics prove the most enthusiastic: the United Kingdom (UK) couples similar enthusiasm with markedly higher risk vigilance, whereas Czech and Swedish respondents remain consistently sceptical, underscoring a broad, though imperfect, west/south versus central/north divide. The Netherlands, Germany, the UK, and Italy value pro-social applications (i.e., realistic crisis drills, public-interest campaigns, and therapeutic ‘mental-health’ avatars), with the Netherlands topping four benefit items and Italy favouring commercial/entertainment uses such as virtual brand ambassadors. By contrast, Czech and Swedish respondents assign uniformly low benefit scores. Juxtaposed with risk perceptions, the UK and Czechia register the greatest vigilance, Sweden the most relaxed, and others intermediate. Divergence seems associated with digital literacy levels and regulatory maturity. The survey reveals a statistically and practically significant gap between perceived risks and benefits: across all seven countries, respondents, on average, rate risks higher than advantages. Regression estimates indicate that advancing age, lower household income, and gender (woman) enlarge this gap—primarily by undermining perceived benefits—whereas tertiary education and residence in certain western or southern European countries—notably, Germany and Italy—are associated with more balanced appraisals. This study concludes that layered governance, interoperable detection standards, and targeted literacy programmes are urgently required.},

    abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.},

The evidence suggests that SDT-informed interventions are often effective at changing health behaviors, including PA/exercise, and associated health outcomes.

We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA. Our review also provides future conceptual and methodological directions for SDT-based research, building on advances in technology (e.g., generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models) and the broader field of behavioral science (e.g., optimization designs, system-level interventions, behavior change intervention ontologies).},

By integrating SDL principles like the Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle, synthetic data use, multi-objective optimization, and parallel experimentation, this approach allows marketers to simulate, experiment, and adapt at scale. Additionally, we highlight emerging real-world applications and conclude with offering recommendations for effectively and responsibly deploying GenAI-driven, SDL-inspired marketing research systems. Thereby, our work can inform and inspire marketers aiming to build more adaptive, data-driven, efficient, and scalable research systems.},

    abstract = {The rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine has prompted medical professionals to increasingly familiarize themselves with related topics. This also demands grasping the underlying statistical principles that govern their design, validation, and reproducibility. Uniquely, the practice of pathology and medicine produces vast amount of data that can be exploited by AI/ML. The emergence of generative AI, especially in the area of large language models and multimodal frameworks, represents approaches that are starting to transform medicine. Fundamentally, generative and traditional (eg, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML techniques rely on certain common statistical measures to function. However, unique to generative AI are metrics such as, but not limited to, perplexity and BiLingual Evaluation Understudy score that provide a means to determine the quality of generated samples that are typically unfamiliar to most medical practitioners. In contrast, nongenerative predictive analytics ML often uses more familiar metrics tailored to specific tasks as seen in the typical classification (ie, confusion metrics measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) or regression studies (ie, root mean square error and R2). To this end, the goal of this review article (as part 4 of our AI review series) is to provide an overview and a comparative measure of statistical measures and methodologies used in both generative AI and traditional (ie, nongenerative predictive analytics) ML fields along with their strengths and known limitations. By understanding their similarities and differences along with their respective applications, we will become better stewards of this transformative space, which ultimately enables us to better address our current and future needs and challenges in a more responsible and scientifically sound manner.},

    abstract = {In the domain of industrial control, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are essential for real-time monitoring and efficient data acquisition. However, as industrial systems grow in scale and complexity, conventional tag configuration methods face challenges in balancing precision and operational efficiency. Addressing these challenges requires innovative solutions. The rapid evolution of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offers a transformative approach. This study introduces a structured prompt optimization strategy, termed structured tag engineering prompt (STEP), to increase the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality tag files. To validate the STEP method, we assessed five mainstream LLMs on basic tag generation tasks via the CodeBERTScore and pass@k metrics. The results revealed that performance of all models has been improved, thus validating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method. On the basis of these findings, a tag generation framework grounded in the STEP method was developed and validated through case studies and practical industrial scenarios. These validations confirmed the STEP method’s applicability, demonstrating its value and potential to advance prompt engineering for SCADA systems. In summary, this study contributes to the automation and intelligence of industrial control systems while providing unique insights through the application of LLMs combined with prompt engineering in addressing complex industrial tasks.},

    abstract = {Stop-and-go waves are a fundamental phenomenon in freeway traffic flow, contributing to inefficiencies, crashes, and emissions. Recent advancements in high-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed traffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast, conventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively coarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of stop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can enhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the quality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a conditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained traffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative refinement. We introduce a new dataset, WaveX (Ji et al., 2025a), comprising 132 hours of data from both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle miles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic state refinement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We demonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of stop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic dynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic state refinement, offering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal resolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management. We also open-source our dataset, trained model and code to enable further research and applications.},

Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI’s capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban–rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a wide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban design, through prompt modification alone.},

While MT/GAI can support students' learning beyond the classroom, overreliance on MT/GAI may hinder development of essential research and composition skills. Despite some research on MT/GAI's role in self-regulated learning, little is known about students' motivations for its use, and the potential mediating influences of instructional context and discipline. This study applies Self-Determination Theory to examine how autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence students' use of MT/GAI in academic writing. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study compares EAP students in an English as a Second Language context in Australia and an English as a Foreign Language context in Vietnam. An online survey validated through confirmatory factor analysis and discriminant validity testing gathered 416 responses, complemented by interviews with 17 students. Findings reveal a complex interplay between MT/GAI use and students' motivational needs. While students generally report moderate autonomy, competence, and relatedness in using MT/GAI in the survey, mixed-effects regression showed Australian students experienced lower relatedness compared with Vietnamese students, with disciplinary differences also significantly influencing students' perceptions of this construct. Interview data further highlighted diversity and complexity of students' perceptions, variation in EAP instructional approaches and peer-teacher dynamics surrounding MT/GAI. These findings support the need for contextually tailored pedagogical approaches fostering collaboration between institutions, teachers, and students, illustrated through innovations from an Australian EAP course that bridge research and practice in MT/GAI-assisted academic writing.},

Yet, it remains unclear how best to assess and understand genAI's influence on our understanding of social reality. Building on insights into the representation of social worlds within texts, we introduce a framework for analyzing genAI's content and its consequences for perceptions of social reality. We demonstrate this “synthetic duality” framework in two parts. First, we show that genAI can create, with minimal guidance, reasonable portrayals of actors and ascribe relational meaning to those actors – virtual social worlds within texts, or “Mondo-Breigers”. Second, we examine how these synthetic documents with interior social worlds affect readers’ view of social reality. We find that they change individuals’ perceptions of actors depicted in the documents, likely by updating individuals’ expectations about the actors and their meanings. However, additional exploratory analyses suggest it is texts’ style, not their construction of “Mondo-Breigers”, that might be influencing people's perceptions. We end with a discussion of theoretical and methodological implications, including how genAI may unsettle structural notions of individuality. Namely, reimagining the duality of individuals and groups could help theorize growing homogeneity in an increasingly genAI-informed world.},

As a highly advanced form of generative artificial intelligence, LLMs possess robust capabilities in simulating human behavior, which can be harnessed to create simulated students for SBL in teacher training. This instrumental case study examines the experiences of 12 pre-service teachers who participated in a session featuring an LLM-enhanced simulation.

Our research aimed to understand how pre-service teachers perceive LLM-enhanced SBL, identify factors that influence SoD, and determine the authenticity barriers. Interview data were analyzed using various coding techniques and derived themes from these codes. The findings revealed that LLM-enhanced SBL provided a realistic and engaging environment, significantly benefiting teaching skill development and learning transfer. However, challenges such as lagging responses, weak comprehension of complex contexts, inconsistencies in simulated students' cognition, and incongruent feedback were noted.

The Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), established in 1974, historically played a crucial role in evaluating prospective student pharmacists. Research consistently linked higher PCAT scores with stronger academic performance in pharmacy programs. However, criticisms of standardized testing, such as biases against underrepresented and low-income students, prompted a shift toward test-optional policies in many institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with a declining number of applicants, accelerated this trend and led numerous pharmacy schools to adopt PCAT-optional admissions policies, ultimately resulting in the examination’s official retirement in January 2024. This paradigm shift raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of current admissions practices amidst evolving educational landscapes marked by grade inflation, reliance on remote learning, and the use of generative artificial intelligence. Concurrently, other health professions, such as medicine and dentistry, continue to use standardized tests for admissions decisions. This commentary explores the impact of discontinuing standardized tests in pharmacy school admissions, highlighting challenges faced and proposing the development of a new, unbiased standardized assessment tool to aid in identifying students equipped to meet the demands of pharmacy education and practice.},

These missions are created and executed by autonomous network agents according to the customer’s intent, which may be expressed in natural language. The agents resolve intents from customers into workflows of network capabilities by leveraging a large-scale network AI model and follow the workflows to execute the mission. As an open, agile system architecture, A-Core holds promise for accelerating innovation and greatly reducing standard release times. The advantages of A-Core are demonstrated through two use cases.},

    abstract = {Background
Mental health disorders affect an estimated 1 in 8 individuals globally, yet traditional interventions often face barriers, such as limited accessibility, high costs, and persistent stigma. Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have introduced AI systems capable of understanding and producing humanlike language in real time. These developments present new opportunities to enhance mental health care.
Objective
We aimed to systematically examine the current applications of GenAI in mental health, focusing on 3 core domains: diagnosis and assessment, therapeutic tools, and clinician support. In addition, we identified and synthesized key ethical issues reported in the literature.
Methods
We conducted a comprehensive literature search, following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines, in PubMed, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Embase, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2024. After screening 783 records, 79 (10.1%) studies met the inclusion criteria.
Results
The number of studies on GenAI applications in mental health has grown substantially since 2023. Studies on diagnosis and assessment (37/79, 47%) primarily used GenAI models to detect depression and suicidality through text data. Studies on therapeutic applications (20/79, 25%) investigated GenAI-based chatbots and adaptive systems for emotional and behavioral support, reporting promising outcomes but revealing limited real-world deployment and safety assurance. Clinician support studies (24/79, 30%) explored GenAI’s role in clinical decision-making, documentation and summarization, therapy support, training and simulation, and psychoeducation. Ethical concerns were consistently reported across the domains. On the basis of these findings, we proposed an integrative ethical framework, GenAI4MH, comprising 4 core dimensions—data privacy and security, information integrity and fairness, user safety, and ethical governance and oversight—to guide the responsible use of GenAI in mental health contexts.
Conclusions
GenAI shows promise in addressing the escalating global demand for mental health services. They may augment traditional approaches by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, offering more accessible support, and reducing clinicians’ administrative burden. However, to ensure ethical and effective implementation, comprehensive safeguards—particularly around privacy, algorithmic bias, and responsible user engagement—must be established.},

The use of AI in diagnostics, image processing and interpretation, treatment personalization, clinical documentation, and drug discovery is an example of the implementation of AI in Western medicine. The need for evidence-based studies and a standardized approach to scientific medicine aligns well with these applications. AI can leave a lasting impact on the Chinese medicine (CM) landscape by increasing expectations and presenting new challenges. The analogy between the CM-specific diagnostic methods and syndrome differentiation, which is holistic, pattern-oriented, patient-centered, and clinical data analysis, is significant at multiple levels. These qualities pose challenges for AI usage in CM, which heavily relies on structured data and pattern recognition. Despite these adversities, AI can still be used in CM through data standardization, prediction formulation, and treatment planning, provided that the integration of this tool considers the primary principles of CM and adheres to ethical and regulatory considerations. This review examines the dichotomous approach to health and medicine in the contexts of AI and CM, highlighting the evolving potential, inherent limitations, and ethical and regulatory issues associated with the application of AI to CM. It provides a foundation for developing technologically progressive yet culturally and philosophically sensitive strategies that are in harmony with traditional clinical values.},

Data were collected from 337 university students in a Chinese university and analyzed using Pearson correlation, chain mediation effect, and thematic analysis. The results indicated no significant direct relationship between academic self-efficacy and GenAI reliance. However, academic anxiety and performance expectations were found to mediate this relationship. The most salient consequences of GenAI reliance were decreased independent thinking ability, reduced innovative thinking ability, restricted self-reflection, and limited critical thinking ability. Additionally, students’ self-initiated and expected teacher-initiated strategies to alleviate these consequences were recognized. This study contributes to the limited understanding of GenAI reliance and provides valuable insights for educators and academic institutions in directing students toward the appropriate and critical utilization of GenAI tools.},

    abstract = {Aim
This study investigates the impact of generative artificial intelligence literacy (GAIL) on self-directed learning skills (SDL) among nursing and midwifery students. Additionally, it examines whether general attitudes toward artificial intelligence (GAAI) mediate this relationship.
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support the development of clinical decision-making and problem-solving skills in nursing and midwifery education, particularly by enhancing students’ self-directed learning abilities.
Methods
A cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational study design was used. The study was conducted in three universities in Türkiye between January and February 2025. 656 nursing and midwifery students participated, selected through cluster sampling. Data were collected using the GAIL, GAAI and SDL scales. The survey form included descriptive questions regarding participants' socio-demographic characteristics and AI usage patterns. Structural equation modeling was conducted to analyze direct and indirect relationships among variables.
Results
A significant positive effect of GAILS on GAAIS was found (β = 0.75, p < .01). GAILS also had a direct and significant effect on SDLS (β = 0.60, p < .01). However, GAAIS did not mediate the relationship between GAILS and SDLS (β = 0.02, p > .05).
Conclusions
AI literacy significantly enhances SDL in nursing and midwifery students. However, positive attitudes toward AI do not independently foster SDL, highlighting the need for structured AI education in healthcare curricula. Future studies should explore long-term AI literacy interventions to assess their impact on academic outcomes and their potential contributions to clinical reasoning and decision-making skills.},

    abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that positive psychology interventions, including brief interventions, can significantly improve well-being outcomes. These findings are particularly important given that many of these interventions are brief and self-administered, making them both accessible and scalable for large populations. However, the efficacy of positive psychology interventions is often constrained by small effect sizes. In light of advancements in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored whether integrating AI chatbots into positive psychology interventions could enhance their efficacy compared to traditional self-administered approaches. Study 1 examined the efficacy of a gratitude intervention delivered through Snapchat's My AI, while Study 2 evaluated a self-affirmation intervention integrated with a customized ChatGPT. Both studies employed within-subject experimental designs. Contrary to our hypotheses, the integration of AI did not yield incremental improvements in gratitude outcomes (Study 1), or self-view outcomes (Study 2) compared to existing non-AI interventions. However, exploratory analyses revealed that the AI-integrated self-affirmation intervention significantly enhanced life satisfaction and medium-arousal positive affect, suggesting potential benefits for selected well-being outcomes. These findings indicate that while AI integration in brief, self-administered positive psychology interventions may enhance certain outcomes, its suitability varies across intervention types. Further research is needed to better understand the contexts in which AI can effectively augment positive psychology interventions.},

While a growing body of literature reports anecdotal or correlational evidence of GenAI's educational potential, rigorous causal evaluations remain limited. To bridge this gap, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effect of GenAI on learning outcomes. Following PRISMA guidelines, we screened five academic databases and identified 68 relevant studies published between 2022 and 2025. These studies yielded a total of 337 effect sizes across various educational levels, subject domains, and instructional contexts. The meta-analysis revealed a moderate overall positive effect of GenAI on learning outcomes (SMD = 0.45, 95 % CI [0.43, 0.47]), suggesting that GenAI-supported interventions are generally more effective than traditional instruction. However, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies (I2 = 95 %), indicating that the magnitude of GenAI's impact varies significantly depending on contextual and methodological factors. Moderator analyses revealed stronger effects in primary and secondary education, within natural science disciplines, and in short-term interventions with smaller sample sizes. These patterns point to both the promise and the complexity of GenAI integration in educational practice. In conclusion, while GenAI shows considerable promise for enhancing learning outcomes, its true potential will only be realized through sustained, efforts to evaluate how, when, and for whom these technologies work best in diverse learning ecosystems.},

This paper systematically investigates the multifaceted impacts of GAI on management decision-making, management algorithms, information integration, and various specific domains. GAI significantly enhances the accuracy of management decisions through its robust data analysis and predictive capabilities. By effectively integrating internal and external information, it reduces information asymmetry and improves both information transparency and the quality of decisions. In terms of specific application areas, GAI shows broad prospects in multiple fields, including business, education, healthcare, content creation, and game development. As GAI technology continues to advance, it will become more intelligent and adaptive.

    abstract = {This study examines the impact of generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models on the academic community, with a specific focus on the Greek math community during the spring semester of 2023–2024. The study involved 81 undergraduate students, 10 university teaching personnel, and 8 researchers. The study used questionnaires, interviews, and work samples to investigate the use and perceptions of Large Language Models in three academic domains: mathematics education, applied mathematics, and machine learning. The environment and the conditions in which the student interview data were collected were in the form of an original type of Mathematics workshop section, encouraging an experimental process that may be adopted in future seminars, conferences, or colloquia. The findings imply cautious usage of Large Language Models with moderate satisfaction among students, modest use by teaching staff, and limited use in research. While Large Language Models have potential in educational contexts, their existing limits in dealing with sophisticated mathematical issues, proofs/justification, and developing unique answers underscore the importance of cautious integration into academic processes. This study highlights the necessity for further exploration of Artificial Intelligence capabilities and their implications for future academic environments. Moreover, it underscores a novel trend in mathematics-focused academia that may bear resemblance to practices observed in other sciences. This area merits further investigation by future research.},

While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.},

Drawing upon Construal Level Theory (CLT), Goal Pursuit Theory, and Nudging Theory, we examine whether narrow (vs. broad) GenAI nudges enhance consumers' sense of empowerment by increasing goal desirability. Three mixed-method studies (one qualitative and two experimental) reveal that narrow GenAI nudges significantly heighten goal desirability, leading to greater consumer empowerment and key behavioral outcomes, including satisfaction, repurchase intentions, and advocacy (net promoter score).

AI integration in education is gaining interest, including in nursing, as students seek formal training on its healthcare applications and limitations.
Aim
To evaluate the predictive effect of nursing students' attitudes and acceptance of artificial intelligence on their clinical competencies.
Methods
This descriptive-correlational study was conducted at 2 universities (February–June 2024) with 441 nursing students. Full-time students in clinical practice participated; those absent or on leave were excluded. The Nursing Students Competency Scale, General Attitudes to Artificial Intelligence Scale, and Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale were used. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used.
Results
The main factors affecting nursing students' clinical competence were “facilitating conditions,” “social influence,” and “negative attitudes” toward AI. A weak correlation was found between positive AI attitudes and acceptance, which explained 8.6% of the competency levels.
Conclusion
Positive perceptions of AI may increase competence, while skepticism may deepen engagement and critical learning. Strategies to improve the acceptance and use of AI are crucial to maximize its benefits in nursing education and practice.},

Understanding the value co-creation process between human consumers and GAI robot assistants is critical for the broader adoption of such technologies. This study seeks to investigate the psychological mechanisms and antecedent factors that underlie the human–AI value co-creation process, which has received limited attention in the literature. Accordingly, a theoretical model based on the Autonomy Competence Relatedness (ACR) model and Mind Perception Theory (MPT) is developed to examine the technological features and psychological factors that promote value co-creation. A survey was conducted in Singapore and collected 607 responses, which were analysed through covariance-based structural equation modelling. Survey results reveal that GAI robot assistant features (i.e., sensing autonomy, thought autonomy, action autonomy, personalisation, anthropomorphism, and interactivity) positively impact value co-creation through the mediation of consumers' psychological motivations, including perceived autonomy, competence, warmth, and relatedness satisfactions. By extending the ACR model with MPT, this study enhances the literature on human-GAI interactions, offering a novel understanding of the psychological factors driving value co-creation in human-centred GAI applications.},

This oral presentation proposes to explain the current state of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in health care and education. We will also showcase a research project that used GAI to create radiographic images and another ongoing project exploring the potential of GAI in dental education and research.
Study Design
Research 1—A pilot study was conducted to enhance ultra-low dose cone beam computed tomographic images of dry skulls to diagnostically acceptable standards. The images were trained using a pix2pix deep generative model. Research 2—A pilot study is being conducted exploring the accuracy of case reports generated by ChatGPT. We queried ChatGPT to create hypothetical case reports and modified the queries to get the best possible output.
Results
Research 1—Preliminary results indicated that the synthesized images are comparable with images made with normal exposure. Research 2—Preliminary results indicate that ChatGPT can create a convincing and accurate case report. Limitations in use of citations were observed.
Conclusion
GAI like Open AI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Microsoft's CoPilot have caused a massive shift in public knowledge of AI. GAI will have major impact in health care and education. GAI tools like ChatGPT have huge potential for use and misuse in educational and research spheres. Creating questions and explanation on complex topics can be done on these tools. Websites like MidJourney can create interesting and novel images. Radiographic images can be created using specific algorithms. We intend to demonstrate how to effectively use GAI like ChatGPT, describe ethical concerns and how to address and regulate them in academia, and identify innovative uses for AI and ChatGPT in dental care and education.

This article addresses this debate by asking: Does disclosing the usage of AI compromise trust in the user? We examine the impact of AI disclosure on trust across diverse tasks—from communications via analytics to artistry—and across individual actors such as supervisors, subordinates, professors, analysts, and creatives, as well as across organizational actors such as investment funds. Thirteen experiments consistently demonstrate that actors who disclose their AI usage are trusted less than those who do not. Drawing on micro-institutional theory, we argue that this reduction in trust can be explained by reduced perceptions of legitimacy, as shown across various experimental designs (Studies 6–8). Moreover, we demonstrate that this negative effect holds across different disclosure framings, above and beyond algorithm aversion, regardless of whether AI involvement is known, and regardless of whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, though it is comparatively weaker than the effect of third-party exposure (Studies 9–13). A within-paper meta-analysis suggests this trust penalty is attenuated but not eliminated among evaluators with favorable technology attitudes and perceptions of high AI accuracy. This article contributes to research on trust, AI, transparency, and legitimacy by showing that AI disclosure can harm social perceptions, emphasizing that transparency is not straightforwardly beneficial, and highlighting legitimacy’s central role in trust formation.},

    abstract = {Objectives
This exploratory study aimed to develop a large language model (LLM)-based process to automate components of network meta-analysis (NMA), including model selection, analysis, output evaluation, and results interpretation. Automating these tasks with LLMs can enhance efficiency, consistency, and scalability in health economics and outcomes research, while ensuring that analyses adhere to established guidelines required by health technology assessment agencies. Improvements in efficiency and scalability may potentially become relevant as the European Union Health Technology Assessment Regulation comes into force, given anticipated analysis requirements and timelines.
Methods
Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet (V2), a process was designed to automate statistical model selection, NMA output evaluation, and results interpretation based on an “analysis-ready” data set. Validation was assessed by replicating examples from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Technical Support Document (TSD2), replicating results of non-Decision Support Unit-published NMAs, and generating comprehensive outputs (eg, heterogeneity, inconsistency, and convergence).
Results
The automated LLM-based process produced accurate results. Compared with TSD2 examples, differences were minimal, within expectations (given differences in sampling frameworks used), and comparable to those observed between estimates produced by the R vignettes against TSD2. Similar consistency was noted for non-Decision Support Unit-published NMA examples. Additionally, the LLM process generated and interpreted comprehensive NMA outputs.
Conclusions
This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of LLMs to automate key components of NMAs, determining the requisite NMA framework based only on input data. Further exploring these capabilities could clarify their role in streamlining NMA workflows.},

There is a strong short- and medium-term decline in the intensity of searches for vacancies, indicating a notable reduction in the supply of young people actively seeking apprenticeships and suggesting great uncertainty among the affected cohort. Occupations with a high proportion of cognitive tasks and with high demands on language skills were particularly affected by the decline. Interestingly, the revealed preferences in the search behavior of young job seekers contrasted with previous expert assessments on the automation risks of occupations and aligned with the most recent assessments of the AI and language model exposure of occupations – before these new assessments existed. Notably, while the supply decline did not reduce the number of signed apprenticeship contracts, we find evidence of declining applicant quality, particularly for commercial employees, the most widely offered apprenticeship in Switzerland.},

    abstract = {This study presents a systematic literature review to explore the emerging role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in entrepreneurship education (EE). While recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in applying GAI tools, such as ChatGPT, to support personalized learning, business model simulation, and decision-making, the field remains at an early exploratory stage. Drawing on 50 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and early 2025, the study aims to map the conceptual landscape, identify key themes, and assess the current state of theoretical and empirical development. The findings reveal four major domains in GAI-enabled EE: personalized and adaptive instruction, simulation-based entrepreneurial training, ethical and psychological concerns, and ecosystem integration through intelligent systems. Although promising use cases are identified, most studies are either conceptual or limited to small-scale exploratory evidence. As such, the long-term impact of GAI on entrepreneurial competence, mindset, and outcomes remains uncertain and calls for empirical caution. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a set of research propositions and a conceptual framework that integrates micro-level instructional applications with meso-level competency development and macro-level ecosystem readiness. These are grounded in educational theories, including constructivism, experiential learning, and social cognitive theory. In addition, the review suggests methodological strategies, such as structural equation modeling (SEM), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), and longitudinal mixed-methods designs, to test GAI's influence across cultural and institutional contexts rigorously. Furthermore, the study discusses actionable implications for educators, policymakers, and researchers, emphasizing the importance of ethical guidance, digital equity, and cross-contextual adaptability. It advocates for designing GAI-integrated curricula that foster not only technical proficiency but also critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning. By systematically synthesizing current findings while avoiding overgeneralized claims, this review contributes to clarifying the conceptual boundaries of GAI in EE and sets the foundation for future empirical exploration.},

    abstract = {Background
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents unprecedented opportunities to redefine conceptions of personhood and cognitive disability, potentially enhancing the inclusion and participation of individuals with cognitive disabilities in society.
Objective
We aim to explore the transformative potential of GenAI in reshaping perceptions of cognitive disability, dismantling societal barriers, and promoting social participation for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Methods
This study is a critical review of current literature in disability studies, artificial intelligence (AI) ethics, and computer science, integrating insights from disability theories and the philosophy of technology. The analysis focused on 2 key aspects: GenAI as a social mirror reflecting societal values and biases, and GenAI as a cognitive partner for individuals with cognitive disabilities.
Results
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for understanding the impact of GenAI on perceptions of cognitive disability. It introduces the concepts of GenAI as a “social mirror” that reflects and potentially amplifies societal biases and as a “cognitive copilot” providing personalized assistance in daily tasks, social interactions, and environmental navigation. This paper also presents a novel protocol for developing AI systems tailored to the needs of individuals with cognitive disabilities, emphasizing user involvement, ethical considerations, and the need to address both the opportunities and challenges posed by GenAI.
Conclusions
Although GenAI has great potential for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities, realizing this potential requires a change in societal attitudes and development practices. This paper calls for interdisciplinary collaboration and close partnership with the disability community in the development and implementation of GenAI technologies. Realizing the potential of GenAI for promoting the inclusion and empowerment of individuals with cognitive disabilities requires a multifaceted approach. This involves a shift in societal attitudes, inclusive AI development practices that prioritize the needs and perspectives of the disability community, and ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper emphasizes the importance of proceeding with caution, recognizing the ethical complexities and potential risks alongside the transformative possibilities of GenAI technology.},

Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 144 peer-reviewed articles from Web of Science, Scopus, and ERIC databases to explore the field's progression, including identifying new developments, shifts in research priorities, and emerging themes that have arisen compared to the first year. The findings reveal an exponential growth in publications, with a significant shift from primarily exploratory inquiries to more systematic and empirically driven investigations. The analysis identified six main research foci: Perceptions and attitudes, psychological and cognitive aspects, teaching and learning strategies, language skills development, writing and feedback, and implementation and integration. While higher education (86.7 %) and English as Foreign Language contexts (86.1 %) dominated the research landscape, there was notable geographical diversity, with strong representation from East Asia and emerging contributions from the Middle East. Mixed-methods approaches (38.9 %) were prevalent, with increasing incorporation of AI-generated content, multimedia recordings, and digital interaction data from 2023 to 2024. Writing emerged as the primary focus (42.4 %) while speaking, listening, and reading skills received comparatively less attention. This review highlights critical gaps, including limited research in K-12 settings, insufficient longitudinal studies, and the need for more diverse language representation beyond English. These findings suggest the field is maturing but requires broader investigation across educational levels, language domains, and geographical contexts to fully understand the impact of generative AI in language education.},

Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how GAI-IDLE fosters user stickiness among Chinese university students by focusing on the psychological needs that influence intrinsic motivation. The constructs of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, control, and flow experience are interpreted within this motivational framework to reveal how learners’ internal psychological states influence their long-term engagement with GenAI-integrated learning environments. Guided by SDT, a survey was conducted with 669 participants, and the data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) via Smart PLS 4.0. Empirical findings demonstrate that GAI-IDLE significantly promotes user stickiness through both direct and indirect pathways. Notably, control (β = 0.440, p < 0.001) and flow experience (β = 0.180, p < 0.001) emerged as strong mediators, underscoring the centrality of learner autonomy and immersive experiences in sustaining engagement. While perceived ease of use showed a moderate positive association, perceived usefulness did not exert a significant effect, suggesting that affective and experiential dimensions may be more critical than utilitarian perceptions in motivating continued use. The study highlights the need for GAI-IDLE platforms to foster intrinsic motivation and sustain meaningful engagement.},

Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences between generative artificial intelligence (AI)-refined and human-written texts in terms of text length, semantic similarity, and linguistic representations. Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models’ prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT’s analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former.

This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 %) and used it for general purposes (79.9 %). However, only 16.2 % actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 % were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 % felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 % had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 % viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.},

    abstract = {Background
There is growing interest in applying generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to respond to electronic patient portal messages, particularly in primary care where message volumes are highest. However, evaluations of GenAI as an inbox communication tool are limited. Qualitative analysis of when and how often GenAI responses achieve communication goals can inform estimates of impact and guide continuous improvement.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate GenAI responses to primary care messages using a medical communication framework.
Methods
This was a descriptive quality improvement study of 201 GenAI replies to a purposively sampled, diverse pool of real primary care patient messages in a large midwestern academic medical center. Two physician reviewers (NSL and NR) used a hybrid deductive-inductive approach to qualitatively identify and define themes, guided by constructs from the “best practice” medical communication framework. After achieving thematic saturation, the reviewers assessed the presence or absence of identified communication themes, both independently and collaboratively. Discrepant observations were reconciled via discussion. Frequencies of identified themes were tallied.
Results
Themes in strengths and limitations emerged across 5 communication domains. In the domain of rapport building, expressing respect and restating key phrases were strengths, while inappropriate or inadequate rapport building statements were limitations. For information gathering, questions that built toward a plan or elicited patient needs were strengths, while questions that were out of place or redundant were limitations. For information delivery, accurate content delivered clearly and professionally was a strength, but delivery of inaccurate content was an observed limitation. GenAI responses could facilitate next steps by outlining choices or providing instruction, but sometimes those next steps were inappropriate or premature. Finally, in responding to emotion, strengths were that emotions were named and validated, while inadequate or absent acknowledgment of emotion was a limitation. Overall, 26.4% (53/201) of all messages displayed communication strengths without limitations, 27.4% (55/201) had limitations without strengths, and the remaining 46.3% (93/201) had both. Strengths outnumbered limitations in rapport building (87/201, 43.3% vs 35/201, 17.4%) and facilitating next steps (73/201, 36.3% vs 39/201, 19.4%). Limitations outnumbered strengths in the remaining domains of information delivery (89/201, 44.3% vs 43/201, 21.4%), information gathering (60/201, 29.9% vs 43/201, 21.4%), and responding to emotion (7/201, 8.5% vs 9/201, 4.5%).
Conclusions
GenAI response quality on behalf of primary care physicians and advanced practice providers may vary by communication function. Expressions of respect or descriptions of common next steps may be appropriate, but gathering and delivering appropriate information, or responding to emotion, may be limited. While communication standards were often met, they were also often compromised. Understanding these strengths and limitations can inform decisions about whether, when, and how to apply GenAI as a tool for primary care inbox communication.},

    abstract = {Background
Individuals with spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D) experience disproportionately high rates of recurrent urinary tract infections, which are often complicated by atypical symptoms and delayed diagnoses. Patient-centered tools, like the Urinary Symptom Questionnaires for Neurogenic Bladder (USQNB), have been developed to support symptom assessment yet remain underused. Generative artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT may offer a more usable approach to improving symptom management by providing real-time, tailored health information directly to patients.
Objective
This study explores the role of ChatGPT (version 3.5) in supporting urinary symptom management for individuals with SCI/D, focusing on its perceived accuracy, usefulness, and impact on health care engagement and self-management practices.
Methods
A total of 30 individuals with SCI/D were recruited through advocacy groups and health care networks. Using realistic, scenario-based testing derived from validated tools for symptom management with SCI/D, such as the USQNB, participants interacted with ChatGPT to seek advice for urinary symptoms. Follow-up interviews were conducted remotely to assess individuals’ experiences using ChatGPT for urinary symptom management. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis, with themes refined iteratively through a consensus-based process.
Results
People with SCI/D reported high levels of trust in ChatGPT’s recommendations, with all 30 participants agreeing or strongly agreeing with the advice provided. ChatGPT’s responses were perceived as clear and comparable to professional medical advice. Participants mentioned concerns about the lack of sources and integration with patient-specific data. ChatGPT influenced individuals’ decision-making by supporting symptom assessment and guiding participants on when to seek professional care or pursue self-management strategies.
Conclusions
ChatGPT is a promising tool for symptom assessment and managing chronic conditions such as urinary symptoms in individuals with SCI/D. While ChatGPT enhances accessibility to health information, further research is needed to improve its transparency and integration with personalized health data to be a more usable tool in making informed health decisions.},

    abstract = {Background
Mental health is an essential element of life. However, existing mental health services face challenges in utilization due to issues such as societal prejudices and a shortage of counselors. Mobile health is gaining attention as an alternative approach to improving mental health by addressing the shortcomings of traditional services. As a result, various mental health apps are being developed, but there is a lack of evaluation research on whether these apps meet users’ needs.
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the content and quality of mental health apps from the user’s perspective and identify the content features that influence evaluation scores. We also aim to guide future updates and improvements in mental health apps to deliver high-quality solutions to users.
Methods
We searched the Google Play Store and iOS App Store using Korean keywords “mental health,” “mental health care,” “depression,” and “stress.” Apps meeting the following criteria were selected for the study: relevance to the topic, written in Korean, more than 700 reviews (Android) or more than 200 reviews (iOS), updated within the past 365 days, available for free, nonduplicate, and currently operational. After identifying and defining the primary contents of the apps, 7 users evaluated their quality using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationships among app content, uMARS scores, star ratings, and the number of reviews. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors influencing uMARS scores and each evaluation item.
Results
The analysis included a total of 41 mental health apps. Content analysis revealed that reminders (n=29, 71%), recording and statistics features (n=29, 71%), and diaries (n=24, 59%) were the most common app components. The top-rated apps, as determined by uMARS evaluations, consistently provided information about counselors and counseling agencies, and included counseling services. uMARS scores were significantly correlated with the presence of health care provider information (r=0.53; P<.001) and counseling/question and answer services (r=0.55; P<.001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that providing more relevant information was associated with higher uMARS scores (β=.361; P=.02).
Conclusions
The quality of mental health apps was evaluated from the user’s perspective using a validated scale. To deliver a high-quality mental health app, it is essential to incorporate app technologies such as generative artificial intelligence during development and to continuously monitor app quality from the user’s perspective.},

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) enables banks to enhance customer service experiences. However, limited research has been conducted on factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) based banking services. Therefore, the present study explored the key antecedents of the aforementioned intention.
Methods
This two-stage study was based on the push–pull–mooring model. In Stage 1, in-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with stakeholders related to AI-based banking services to identify critical factors influencing customers’ intention to switch from traditional to AI-based customer services. In Stage 2, the results obtained in Stage 1 were combined with results from the literature to create a second-order model and direct-effect model (Models 1 and 2, respectively). Quantitative survey data were then collected to validate these models.
Results
Model 1 indicated that among pull, push, and mooring factors, pull factors had the strongest effect on the aforementioned intention, followed by mooring factors and then push factors. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 70 %. Furthermore, Model 2 indicated that the attractiveness of the alternative (a pull factor) and the need for interpersonal interaction and inertia (mooring factors) were the key factors influencing switching intention. The explanatory power (R2) of this model was 76 %.
Conclusion
In summary, this study identified and validated critical factors affecting customers’ intention to switch to AI-based banking services. The findings enrich the understanding the social interaction and user behavior of AI, offering valuable insights for promoting AI-driven services and applications.},

This integration seeks to enhance interactivity with student players and foster an immersive, dynamic learning environment. We applied this approach in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing classrooms to examine its impact on both the affective and cognitive aspects of student writing learning, as well as their writing performance. Utilizing a quasi-experimental design, the study involved two classes of Chinese undergraduate students. One class (n = 42) engaged with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, while the other class (n = 43) interacted with conventional NPCs in a storyline-based game designed to enhance argumentative writing skills. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaires assessing students' intrinsic motivation, situational interest, cognitive load, and effort regulation. Additionally, student essays were evaluated to compare writing performance across the two conditions. Qualitative data, including students' chat histories with ChatGPT-powered NPCs, were gathered to investigate their interactions. The results indicated that engaging with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs positively influenced students' intrinsic motivation and situational interest, leading them to invest greater effort in completing learning tasks. Notably, interactions with ChatGPT-enhanced NPCs did not increase students’ cognitive load during the learning process. Moreover, students who interacted with ChatGPT-powered NPCs exhibited superior writing performance, producing essays that were significantly clearer, more elaborated, and more persuasive, while also more effectively addressing opposing viewpoints. Additionally, students employed various conversational strategies while interacting with these NPCs. This study not only advances our understanding of the role of generative artificial intelligence in educational contexts but also provides valuable insights for educators seeking to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes through innovative instructional strategies.},

The Longevity Games Interview Simulator provides an innovative approach to preparing students for real-world research interactions by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Claude-3.7. This paper outlines the development and demonstrates the benefits of the simulator, designed to mimic interviews with older adults to enhance students’ interviewing skills, empathy, and cultural competence. Key outcomes included preparing students for real-world interactions with interview subjects, improving their ability to identify and properly document protected health information (PHI), gaining experience in asking relevant follow-up questions, and directing conversations to achieve interview goals. The simulator used generative AI models to create realistic interview scenarios based on demographic data from Rochester, NY. Components of the simulator included a student interview-question selection and creation portion, an interview-guide worksheet, a post-simulation quiz on the materials, and a reflective exercise focusing on information gathering and ethical considerations regarding PHI. This tool was designed for the Science of Aging course’s CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience) to provide students with practical, repeatable interview practice. A small pilot study with senior nursing students indicated that the simulator improved students’ confidence, preparedness, and understanding of ethical considerations. This paper also discusses how the simulator has potential for adaptation across educational contexts and encourages educators to develop their own custom interview simulations.},

It compared large language model (LLM)-conducted analysis with human analysis of the same qualitative data, explored optimisation of LLMs for narrative analysis and evaluated their benefits and drawbacks. Using existing data, 138 short stories written by young people (aged 13–25 years) about social media, identity formation and food choices were analysed separately three times: by human researchers, and by two different LLMs (Claude and GPT-o1). The method was developed iteratively, combining Ipsos' artificial intelligence (AI) expertise and tools with researchers’ qualitative analysis expertise. Claude and GPT-o1 each conducted a narrative analysis of all 138 stories using the same analytic steps as the human researchers. Findings between the humans and both LLMs were then compared. Both LLMs quickly and successfully conducted a narrative analysis of the stories. Their findings were comparable to those of the human researchers and were judged by the researchers to be credible and thorough. Beyond replication, the LLMs provided additional insights into the data that enhanced the human analysis. This study highlights the significant potential benefits of LLMs to the field of qualitative research and proposes that LLMs could one day be seen as valuable tools for strengthening research quality and increasing efficiency. Additionally, this study discusses ethical concerns surrounding responsible AI use in research and proposes a framework for using LLMs in qualitative analysis.},

    abstract = {Background
The medical interview remains a cornerstone of clinical training. There is growing interest in applying generative artificial intelligence (AI) in medical education, including medical interview training. However, its utility in culturally and linguistically specific contexts, including Japanese, remains underexplored. This study investigated the utility of generative AI for Japanese medical interview training.
Objective
This pilot study aimed to evaluate the utility of generative AI as a tool for medical interview training by comparing its performance with that of traditional face-to-face training methods using a simulated patient.
Methods
We conducted a randomized crossover pilot study involving 20 postgraduate year 1‐2 physicians from a university hospital. Participants were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group A began with an AI-based station on a case involving abdominal pain, followed by a traditional station with a standardized patient presenting chest pain. Group B followed the reverse order, starting with the traditional station for abdominal pain and subsequently within the AI-based station for the chest pain scenario. In the AI-based stations, participants interacted with a GPT-configured platform that simulated patient behaviors. GPTs are customizable versions of ChatGPT adapted for specific purposes. The traditional stations involved face-to-face interviews with a simulated patient. Both groups used identical, standardized case scenarios to ensure uniformity. Two independent evaluators, blinded to the study conditions, assessed participants’ performances using 6 defined metrics: patient care and communication, history taking, physical examination, accuracy and clarity of transcription, clinical reasoning, and patient management. A 6-point Likert scale was used for scoring. The discrepancy between the evaluators was resolved through discussion. To ensure cultural and linguistic authenticity, all interviews and evaluations were conducted in Japanese.
Results
AI-based stations scored lower across most categories, particularly in patient care and communication, than traditional stations (4.48 vs 4.95; P=.009). However, AI-based stations demonstrated comparable performance in clinical reasoning, with a nonsignificant difference (4.43 vs 4.85; P=.10).
Conclusions
The comparable performance of generative AI in clinical reasoning highlights its potential as a complementary tool in medical interview training. One of its main advantages lies in enabling self-learning, allowing trainees to independently practice interviews without the need for simulated patients. Nonetheless, the lower scores in patient care and communication underline the importance of maintaining traditional methods that capture the nuances of human interaction. These findings support the adoption of hybrid training models that combine generative AI with conventional approaches to enhance the overall effectiveness of medical interview training in Japan.

This mixed-method study addresses this gap by exploring voice construction in GenAI-assisted photo essays from a dialogic perspective. In this study, we invited writing teachers to rank five student-produced photo essays according to their perceived voice strengths and analyzed the rankings using Kendall's Coefficient Concordance. The statistical analysis shows a weak agreement (W = 0.27) among raters, suggesting that voice is perceived quite diversely. The follow-up interviews with six focal raters reveal that they could agree on the importance of having unique ideas and angles in writing, keeping writing coherent and focused, using appropriate quotations, and incorporating images to enhance storytelling. However, opinions diverge regarding using primary and secondary texts, adopting academic discourse features, and including AI-generated images. The study adds to scholarly conversation of voice in composition studies and suggests that divergence in perceiving voice could be leveraged to fuel the discussion about voice in writing pedagogy.},

Second, the teachers developed sophisticated collaboration patterns with the Gen-AI, demonstrating iterative refinement approaches and strategic integration of Gen-AI suggestions throughout the LS cycles. Third, teachers' critical reflections showed evolution in their evaluation and application of Gen-AI contributions, maintaining professional agency while leveraging Gen-AI capabilities effectively.
Research limitations/implications
This study has several limitations that inform future research directions. Our investigation focused specifically on EFL higher education using a single Gen-AI tool (Kimi), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other educational contexts and AI platforms.
Practical implications
These findings suggest that Gen-AI integration through LS can enhance teachers' professional practice while promoting critical engagement with Gen-AI tools. The study provides insights into how Gen-AI can be meaningfully integrated into teacher professional development through collaborative LS approaches.
Originality/value
The study demonstrates how the LS framework supports balanced AI integration while maintaining teacher agency. In addition, it reveals the process of AI capability discovery and strategic implementation in EFL teaching.},

    abstract = {Generative AI, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, have become a prevalent source of digital content. Despite their widespread availability, these models come with critical weaknesses, such as a lack of factual accuracy. Being informed about the advantages and disadvantages of these tools is essential for using AI safely and adequately, yet not everyone is aware of them. Therefore, we explored in three experimental studies how disclaimers affect people's perceptions of AI-authorship and AI-generated content on scientific topics. Additionally, we investigated the impact of information presentation and authorship attributions—whether content is authored solely by AI or co-authored with humans. Across the experiments, no effects of disclaimer type on text perceptions and only minor effects on authorship perceptions were found. In Study 1, an evaluative (vs. neutral) information presentation decreased credibility perceptions, while informing about AI's strengths vs. limitations did not. In addition, we found participants to believe in the machine heuristic, that is, to attribute more accuracy and less bias to AI than to human authors. Study 2 revealed interaction effects between authorship and disclaimer type, providing insights into possible balancing effects of human-AI co-authorship. In Study 3, both strengths and limitations disclaimers induced higher credibility ratings than basic disclaimers. This research suggests that disclaimers fail to univocally influence the perception of AI-generated output. Further interventions should be developed to raise awareness of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs and to advocate for ethical practices in handling AI-generated content, especially regarding factual information.},

To provide marketers with targeted and actionable guidance, this study investigated the behavioral mechanisms underlying the adoption of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technology. Specifically, it examined the influence of AIGC features (accuracy, competence, anthropomorphism, and interactivity) and the distinct psychological mechanisms of awe on users' behavioral intentions. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative data (N = 860) with qualitative research (user reviews). The analysis revealed that the awe experience significantly influences AIGC users' preferences to continue using the technology. Positive awe had a significant positive effect, while threatened awe had a comparatively weaker negative effect. The four features (accuracy, competence, anthropomorphism, and interactivity) of AIGC contribute significantly to its users' continued usage intention. Notably, positive awe induced by competence, anthropomorphism, and interactivity significantly outweighed threatened awe, with the exception of accuracy. The findings reveal that the unique features of AIGC not only evoke users’ perceived awe but also strengthen their intentions to continue using the technology.},

Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the lack of clarity regarding the mechanisms by which generative AI influences SRL, as well as the difficulties teachers encounter when trying to incorporate it into their classrooms. This systematic review study investigates how to design SRL activities using GenAI. We examined 73 articles published over the past five years, drawn from four databases: Web of Science, ProQuest, ERIC, and Scopus. This study has three major empirical findings. First, six pedagogical affordances from GenAI across the three phases of SRL—forethought, Performance, and self-reflection—are (i) creating personalized learning objectives; (ii) searching for, analyzing, and integrating resources; (iii) monitoring and evaluating progress; (iv) recommending learning strategies; (v) recording progress and providing feedback; and (vi) generating new ideas and examples. Second, popular student learning activities using GenAI in each phase are information searching in the forethought; strategies for problem-solving in the performance, and obtaining feedback and conducting self-assessments in the self-reflection. Third, two major dimensions influencing student engagement in SRL using GenAI are individual and environmental. Finally, we visualize how the three empirical findings relate to each other. Our findings help us understand how AI as a human-machine collaborative tool affects the SRL process. This study provides practical recommendations for facilitating SRL in GenAI-enhanced environments and offers guidance for the design and development of personalized GenAI learning tools.},

    abstract = {Social Network Alignment (SNA) aims to identify and match user accounts belonging to the same real-world individual across multiple social platforms, which has garnered growing research interest. Existing methods typically encode textual and structural information into a latent space and learn a mapping function from annotated user alignments to accomplish SNA. However, the inherent sparsity and noise in social data limit these models’ ability to fully capture user characteristics. Moreover, direct alignment based on latent space often overlooks critical details from the original information, reducing both alignment quality and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-SNA, a novel framework that integrates generative information fusion and LLM-guided iterative mechanism. The generative information fusion leverages LLMs to transform sparse user attributes, microblogs, and neighbor descriptions into enriched, comprehensive user profiles. We further perform intra-network and inter-network graph learning on enriched user profiles to incorporate structural information. To balance accuracy and efficiency, the LLM-guided iterative mechanism first applies a coarse filter based on embedding similarities to collect potential alignment candidates. The LLM then evaluates these candidates by reasoning over their original textual information. If the LLM deems the candidates misaligned, the candidate set is expanded until confident matches emerge. Comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the advantages of LLM-SNA over state-of-the-art baseline methods and highlight the potential of LLMs for SNA tasks.},

Current digital literacy frameworks lack AI-specific competencies, resulting in inconsistencies in the assessment of AI competence. This study aims to establish a standardized assessment framework for Generative AI competence by identifying key skill factors and empirically validating a structured evaluation tool called the Generative AI Competence Scale (GenAIComp). The proposed GenAIComp has five essential factors: Information and Data Literacy, Communication and Collaboration, Digital Content Creation, Safety and Ethics, and Problem-Solving. A quantitative approach was employed, incorporating expert validation, pilot testing, and extensive empirical evaluation involving 1000 participants, principally university students. The factor analysis confirmed a robust 5-factor structure with strong psychometric properties. The final model demonstrated excellent fit indices, confirming its reliability and validity in assessing Generative AI competence across the five key factors. Research demonstrates that educational background considerably impacts AI competence, with individuals from technical disciplines showing a greater aptitude for problem-solving and content generation. Gender-based disparities were noted, with males achieving marginally higher scores in several factors, but with minimal effect sizes. Correlation analysis indicated that perceived AI expertise and frequency of AI utilization significantly influenced competence, especially in data literacy and problem-solving, and exhibited less correlation with ethical awareness. GenAIComp provides a reliable tool for assessing AI competence, helping educators, industry experts, and policymakers to design AI training programs and integrate AI literacy into curricula and thereby AI technology advancement in society. Future research should explore its applicability across cultures and include performance-based assessments to enhance AI competence.},

    abstract = {With the increasing popularity of network encryption protocols, analyzing encrypted traffic has become a significant challenge for network security. In this context, deep learning methods have been widely applied to intrusion detection and traffic classification tasks due to their powerful feature extraction capabilities. However, these methods still face two main limitations: relying on unimodal feature extraction, which ignores the multimodal characteristics of network traffic, or adopting simple static fusion strategies, which may fail to capture the complex semantic associations between different modalities. These limitations make it challenging for models to detect sophisticated attacks concealed within otherwise normal encrypted traffic. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an Entropy-Regulated Cross-Modal Generative Framework for Intrusion Detection (ER-CMGI), which combines the generative power of diffusion models with dynamic information-theoretic optimization techniques. The framework integrates variational autoencoders(VAEs) with a lightweight diffusion model for multimodal feature extraction and generation. It implements an adaptive fusion mechanism using a hybrid entropy-based approach that combines both traditional low-entropy priority and inverse entropy weighting through learnable mixing coefficients. The cross-modal generation consistency is achieved through a lightweight diffusion model, which enables self-supervised learning via direct cross-modal generation and comparison. This design enhances semantic alignment across heterogeneous modalities through cross-modal generative learning. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves F1 scores of 99.12% and 97.81% on two datasets, respectively. This study presents a dynamically adaptive and entropy-guided framework for intrusion detection in network environments, which shows effectiveness in capturing complex attack patterns. By integrating dynamic feature fusion with cross-modal semantic modeling, the framework enhances detection accuracy and interpretability, offering a promising approach for improving network security under evolving threat scenarios.},

    abstract = {With climate change, habitat destruction, and increased population ages, the incidence of both communicable and non-communicable diseases is rising, and managing these has become a growing concern. In recent years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a transformative era for smart healthcare applications. These models, built on advanced ML architectures like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), have demonstrated significant capabilities in various medical tasks. This review aims to provide an overview of the potential benefits of generative AI and LLMs in smart healthcare applications, as well as challenges and ethical considerations. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant research papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Databases such as PubMed, PMC, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched using keywords related to generative AI, LLMs, and healthcare applications. The relevant papers were analyzed to extract key findings and contributions. Generative AI and LLMs are powerful tools that can process and analyze massive amounts of data. Researchers are actively exploring their potential to transform healthcare-powering intelligent virtual health assistants, crafting personalized patient care plans, and facilitating early detection and intervention for medical conditions. With ongoing research and development, the future of generative AI and LLMs in healthcare is promising; however, issues such as bias in AI models, lack of explainability, ethical concerns, and integration difficulties must be addressed.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have introduced novel paradigms for long-tailed medical text classification. This task is challenging because tailed classes suffer from severe data scarcity while requiring a comprehensive understanding of domain-specific medical information. To this end, we propose a Generative Class feature Fusion with Agent attention (GCFA) model, which leverages LLM-driven data generation and information fusion to enhance feature representations and mitigate data imbalance. Specifically, a generative head-tailed fusion strategy is proposed, which generates tailed samples by strategically fusing semantically diverse features from both head and tailed distributions. This ensures that generated samples retain tail-class identity while enriching their semantic diversity. Then, we design a prompt-based medical terminology learning method, where LLMs can mine critical, especially some low-frequency medical terms, from three public datasets to construct a medical vocabulary dictionary. This dictionary guides our Medical Agent Attention Mechanism, enabling targeted emphasis on important medical terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated datasets. Our code is available: https://github.com/WQYwqy123456/GCFA-123#.},

First, based on governance theory, institutional theory, resource-based theory, and administrative ecology theory, this paper analyzes the factors influencing the governance efficiency of GAI policies & regulations from three dimensions: government governance, resource endowment, and technology environment. Second, this paper examines the policies and regulations on GAI from 24 countries as samples. Employing the fsQCA and NCA method, along with PMC index evaluation results, this paper explores potential pathways to enhance the governance efficiency of GAI policies and regulations. Third, the configurational pathway analysis of governance efficiency in GAI policies and regulations identifies six critical influencing factors: policy and regulatory quality, government actions, venture capital investment, AI governance capacities, public stakeholder engagement, and AI safety mechanisms. Finally, through necessity analysis, configurational analysis, and robustness testing of these six factors, the paper reveals that technology-resource driven, policy-actor coordinated, and government-resource mediated implementation configurations can effectively achieve high-level governance efficiency in GAI policies and regulations. Therefore, it provides a reference for optimizing the governance practice of GAI policies and regulations.},

    abstract = {Smart Manufacturing (SM) is an important factor for driving innovation, enhancing operational efficiency, and increasing sustainable industrial growth in an increasingly competitive and resource-constrained world. However, it faces several challenges related to increasing energy consumption and climate change. The high energy demands of connected devices and robotic manipulators increase the carbon footprint. To resolve this issue, most enterprises are now transitioning to use Renewable Energy Sources (RES), and optimizing their power and energy usage, while holding the process efficient. To fully achieve this transition, a detailed power modeling of the robotic manufacturing system is crucial and, therefore, it is important to investigate this power modeling of the robotic manipulators’ consumption in a Smart Sustainable Manufacturing (SSM) to achieve the best power modeling results and better integrability analytics in optimal power planning of the robotic systems power supply. To this end, this paper presents a deep Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-based modeling of robotic manipulators’ power supply interaction with the power grid, and RES. In the proposed system, which is powered by solar energy and the power grid, a SSM equipped with ten 6-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) robotic manipulators is considered in the presence of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs). Subsequently, a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) is employed to generate synthetic data for the system alongside the real data, thereby expanding the analytical horizons across varying operational characteristics of the system. Following this, a Residual Networks (ResNet) is developed to comprehensively analyze and predictively model the power consumption of the manipulators and their interactions with the power supply resources. Finally, the proposed hybrid GAI modeling strategy is numerically evaluated across a broad spectrum of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (MSE= 10−4, MAE= 3.6×10−3, R2= 99.98%, MARE= 1.97×10−2, RMSPE= 8.83×10−2%, MSRE= 7.8×10−3, RMSRE= 8.84×10−2, MAPE= 1.97×10−2%, and Max Error= 2.04×10−2), where these metrics demonstrate superior performance in power modeling. As a result, the concept of Grid-to-Robot (G2R) is introduced for the first time as a foundation for further advancements in SSM, enhancing sustainability and mitigating negative impacts on climate change while contributing to the development of an advanced manufacturing system.},

    abstract = {The growing integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in traditional search interfaces is transforming how consumers search for information online. When AI-generated summaries are at the forefront without allowing users to opt out, their search experience becomes less user-driven and more system-controlled. Yet, its impact on consumer switching intentions is underexplored. Grounded in consumer empowerment and psychological reactance theories, this mixed-method research investigates how the lack of a choice feature to opt out of AI integration drives consumer switching intentions. Analyzing real-world discussions on Reddit, followed by an experiment, our findings reveal that when users lack the choice to disable AI-generated content, they feel less empowered, more intrusive, and irritated, increasing their likelihood of switching. Our findings extend interface design literature by identifying “choice to opt out of AI feature” as a critical design element for GenAI interfaces. While previous research has primarily theorized consumer empowerment in AI-enabled interfaces by focusing on autonomy, power, and control, our findings advance this literature by empirically demonstrating consumer choice as a novel and critical antecedent of empowerment. Further, we contribute to psychological reactance theory by extending it to a permanent, system-level disruption and demonstrate that the scale and permanence of reactance drive switching intentions. We provide actionable recommendations for interface designers to incorporate a toggle switch into GenAI interfaces, enabling users to choose to disable AI features. It suggests that managers may use empowerment as a strategic differentiator of interfaces to prevent consumers from migrating to alternative interfaces.},

Generative AI has extensive and valuable applications in many industrial and medical fields and is a possible solution for industries that struggle to collect large quantities of data. The present study evaluated the use of generative AI in eye disease prediction. Because retinal images are difficult to acquire, this study used a generative AI model [i.e., the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)] to conduct data augmentation, thereby improving the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed for eye disease detection. This study adopted the DDIM primarily for its high inference speed and ability to consistently generate high-quality samples in a limited number of steps, making it suitable for tasks that require high-quality medical images. With the increasing prevalence of electronic products, the number of patients with retinopathy or optic neuropathy is increasing annually, and patients are experiencing these diseases at increasingly younger ages. Moreover, eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration are becoming increasingly common in modern society. The developed CNN model exhibited a 3 % higher accuracy when it was trained using the data generated by the DDIM than when it was trained without these data. This CNN model can screen eye disease symptoms early to enable patients to receive timely treatment, thereby mitigating the risk and consequences of eye diseases. The results of this study indicate that the training data generated using the DDIM can enhance the accuracy of early eye disease detection.},

Moreover, in some cases, the provided images or descriptions may not accurately represent the item. We refer to such situations as missing data. In the fashion domain, visual information is crucial, as people are unlikely to buy clothing without seeing its design and appearance. Thus, we propose employing a text-to-image Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate missing visual data from available textual descriptions, enabling a multi-modal recommender system that leverages both visual and textual information. We also introduce an adaptive feature importance learning mechanism to dynamically determine the weight of each multi-modal feature when calculating the preference score.

The model is trained with a cross-entropy loss function and fine-tuned using Few-shot Learning, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, and ReAct strategies, ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score.

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise improvements in the adaptability and quality of educational technologies for SRL, there remain concerns about the hallucinations in content generated by LLMs, which can compromise both the learning experience and ethical standards. To address these challenges, we proposed GenAI-enabled approaches for evaluating personalised SRL scaffolds before they are presented to students, aiming for reducing hallucinations and improving overall quality of LLM-generated personalised scaffolds. Specifically, two approaches are investigated. The first approach involved developing a multi-agent system approach for reliability evaluation to assess the extent to which LLM-generated scaffolds accurately target relevant SRL processes. The second approach utilised the “LLM-as-a-Judge” technique for quality evaluation that evaluates LLM-generated scaffolds for their helpfulness in supporting students. We constructed evaluation datasets, and compared our results with single-agent LLM systems and machine learning approach baselines. Our findings indicate that the reliability evaluation approach is highly effective and outperforms the baselines, showing almost perfect alignment with human experts’ evaluations. Moreover, both proposed evaluation approaches can be harnessed to effectively reduce hallucinations. Additionally, we identified and discussed bias limitations of the “LLM-as-a-Judge” technique in evaluating LLM-generated scaffolds. We suggest incorporating these approaches into GenAI-powered personalised SRL scaffolding systems to mitigate hallucination issues and improve the overall scaffolding quality.},
